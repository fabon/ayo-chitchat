text:Creating your own clothes: Advice?	labels:You're missing a lot of stuff here, this is very Step 1: Collect Underpants, Step 2: . . . , Step 3: Profit.    As someone who has built a brand over the last three years (I make the stuff myself) and is debating on introducing clothing, saying you have nice ideas that people will like is . . . not enough. Is you idea truly unique? Niche? Is there anyone doing anything similar? Where is your place in the market and how do you compare to your competitors? Why would someone buy a thing from you instead of someone else?    If I had the money, I'd greatly prefer to just go to someone else to produce it, but if you don't know design and pattern-making, then you're going to also have to pay someone to do that. You won't be able to go to a manufacturer and be like "here's my idea", they want very detailed and precise patterns to work from. It's an entire job in and of itself.    There's just so much missing here it's hard to even give advice, I have no idea what you do/don't know - about clothing, about business, and about marketing.	episode_done:True
text:Creating your own clothes: Advice?	labels:Maybe just pick up a sewing machine (vintage!) and begin with altering your existing clothes or eBay deals to fit you perfectly, then as you get to understand how shirts, pants, jackets, etc are constructed you could try buying fabric and make your own... then go from there if you enjoy it and feel like continuing? If you were to hire out the manufacturing it would still be valuable to have some knowledge and experience as far as how it’s done and what makes quality vs cheap construction...	episode_done:True

text:Creating your own clothes: Advice?	labels:Definitely start by getting a used sewing machine and just learning the basics of sewing, first try tailoring your own stuff or making really simple things like pillow covers or masks and then try something more complicated like a shirt (and while I always prefer to make my own patterns, I recommend starting out with ones you can buy or find online). Even if you don't plan to do most of the manufacturing yourself, it'll still be vital for you to understand the process.	episode_done:True
text:The Future is Made to Measure	labels:TIL, the term "shoddy" came from Brooks Brothers being shitty.
text:Actually it didn't. It means fabric put together from sweepings and scraps, and only later came to mean terrible quality. I remember being in the men's department of one of the huge clothing stores in T Nagar in Chennai and seeing a cheap shawl that was marked x percent shoddy, the way other clothing might be 20 percent nylon.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:The Future is Made to Measure	labels:For some reason, I thought Trunk Tailors was much more expensive.  Yeah, MTM is one of thos places where... although machines not ever really overtake the hand, efficiency from machines is eventually going to complement handwork to make something very good very cost-efficient, and then Bespoke and RTW will both be struggling to compete.
text:I think MTM is more of a long-term threat to bespoke rather than RTW. The technological improvements, which will theoretically make it possible for software to draft a pattern indistinguishable from one drawn up by a human, could eventually make it very difficult for bespoke makers to compete on fit. The market could shrink to basically just the guys who want to be able to say they bought bespoke for sentimental reasons.  RTW will likely always exist just because it’s cheaper and easier to mass produce clothes in standardized sizing. Maybe the higher-end RTW market shrinks, but  at the bottom I don’t see a future where Zara only stocks M2M suits ordered online in advance.	labels:This article was about bespoke, but there are a lot of businesses taking mtm from the other angle -- not only making it cheaper, but making it such a cheap marketing hack, using it to reduce dead stock  using it to reduce return rates... As it gets better, it's going to get more efficient through multiple dimensions and eventually, rtw is going to feel some pain too.	episode_done:True

A great bargain and I truly loved it. Now I'm considering getting another leather jacket of a different style. A local sales guy told me that he didn't think that Conroy would be a part of any sale. If that's true, I'd probably need to reconsider about getting one due to its price. Has anyone seen Conroy go on sale? Or should I just wait? Any thoughts?

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - February 17, 2021	labels:# How acceptable are tailored shorts really as you get older?  I am reconsidering my outfits for my planned road-trip summer vacation in Italy, and classy non-beach vacations in general  I had planned for the daytime white, light blue and light pink slim-fit polo shirts, paired with light blue, pale red, and pale yellow tailored shorts. Boat shoes and Espadrilles for footwear. Basically my tried-and-true combos for hot weather vacays.  But as I reach the tail-end of my late 30s, **I wonder if shorts are appropriate at all anymore**. I always strive to look extremely put together, rarely wear anything without a collar, no denim, custom-tailored shirts and blazers even in home office, etc.  Shall I just wear my night-time outfits (pants and long-sleeve button-down shirts, both in linen or linen-cotton mix, in white and light pastel colors) during the day also?
text:You can absolutely still wear shorts. But if it’s something that’s going to bother you, linen and linen blend pants are the way to go. Consider loosening up the fit on the pants, you don’t have to go full on wide flowy linen if that’s not your thing, but a relaxed taper or something would be good. You can still pair these with your polos too. Another option up top would be to get a linen blend knit sweater style polo instead of a standard pique.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - February 17, 2021	labels:What’s the best place for MTM nowadays? I know Indochino fell out of favour for their shit quality.
text:Lol, am I the MTM expert now?  For **shirts**, Spier and Mackay stands out in price -- starting at $59 with 20% off sales and 20% off your first order with referral code. Proper Cloth is a sub favorite, but costs $100 per (as do most competitors, roughly -- Luxire, Alton Lane, Black Lapel). SuitSupply's current custom tier is $100, but they work very hard to confuse you about whether that's MTM or not. (Spier is also a standout because they technically make you a custom pattern, which brings it one notch closer to being bespoke, but that's not a big deal in itself given it's online measurements and remote manufacturing).  For **Suits**... Spier's online MTO program is not really MTM. SuitSupply still tries to confuse you. I like my Black Lapel suit. They start at $500... And I hear their remake policy no longer offers returns, but still unlimited remakes... Oliver Wicks starts at $600 and gets good reviews. You ideally want in person MTM, but for that, you have to tell me what the closest city is. If that city is not New York, you won't have a ton of options. If it is New York, I could write a book on it.  For **outerwear**... overcoats are expensive. Black Lapel makes some. Craftsman Clothing makes suede jackets. Yeossal makes chore coats at $200 and safari jackets at $300, which is pretty good, but you kind of just need to put the measurements you want into the comments and hope for the best, it's not the most comprehensive MTM system, they call it MTO but it's somewhere in between what you'd call MTO and MTM.	labels:	episode_done:True

A genuinely likable guy with an insane level of down-to-earth rugged charisma.    And all kinds of successful... The fantasy kind of successes you have before you hit puberty. Race car driver. Famous actor. Successful businessman.   But, his greatest success of all was his enduring style.

text:The Terribly High Cost of Cheap Goods	labels:Most of this conversation is sadly ignorant of how global development works and prioritizes people in wealthy, developed countries over those in developing countries that need manufacturing to raise their standards of living. Since the post-colonial period there has only been two ways that any countries have significantly increased their economic development level, resource extraction like oil (which just isn't an option for most countries) and becoming a low-cost manufacturing center.  Countries that are now flourishing like Japan, South Korea and Taiwan were only able to do so because they became hubs for cheap international manufacturing, which enabled them to transform  into thriving, world-class developed economies.  Slave labor or child labor should always be unacceptable, but the idea that you are helping anyone except those who are already wealthy on a global scale buy strictly buying goods made in developed markets is ignorant. If people stopped buying goods from developing countries they would basically be condemning them to permanent poverty.	episode_done:True

text:FAQ: How do I pick the right size buying online?	labels:To add on to what has already been said about measurements.  Having a trusted tailor.  Knowing what realistically can be altered about a garment and, then factoring that alternation into the cost of purchase can help a lot with making online clothing purchases.	episode_done:True
text:FAQ: How do I pick the right size buying online?	labels:You guys are making this way too complicated. Just do what I do, be roughly the same height and body type as the models on these sites are and then buy the sizes they are wearing. Done.	episode_done:True
text:FAQ: How do I pick the right size buying online?	labels:You buy xxl and if it's too big you eat more and make it fit.	episode_done:True
text:FAQ: How do I pick the right size buying online?	labels:No other way besides just buying multiple sizes and trying them on. Find websites with good return policies like nordstrom and buy a few items to find your fit with the brand. Just make sure to buy things while they are still plenty in stock, or you risk buying something that doesn't fit, only to find out your actual size already sold out.  Part of the reason people are loyal to certain brands is because they become more familiar with their fits, and then you can buy online with more confidence, even with final sale items	episode_done:True
text:FAQ: How do I pick the right size buying online?	labels:Do  * Know your measurements * Check size charts. Know the difference between body measurements and garment measurements. * Check return policies * Ask others with experience with the brand * Compare to things you already know fit well  Don't  * place too much stock in letters or photos of models. * assume that one of the sizes available is going to fit you well * buy something that you know won't fit because it's a "good deal." * Place too much weight in measurements. They're very helpful, but garment measurements are taken from the outside of the garment, so the thickness of the garment factors in, structure factors in, your layers factor in... there are a lot of variables, so again, be aware of the return policy.	episode_done:True

text:FAQ: How do I pick the right size buying online?	labels:My normal ways are:  \- Know your measurements - Not foolproof as I found out when ordering a navy blazer online recently but certainly helps you out, especially on places like eBay  \- Ordering multiple sizes when shopping somewhere new - Technically cheating maybe and not always a viable option at high price points but this is generally a good way to see how a particular retailer fits you  \- Stick to retailers whose sizing you trust - This is obviously very limiting but sometimes I just want to try a style and I know the Uniqlo version will fit me well.   &#x200B;  As a side note too, when you try things on from brands, take pictures and save them. Then you can build up a catalogue of the ways retailers fit. This helps when you look back in six months and are tempted to reorder that thing you've been eying because you can't remember why you sent it back.	episode_done:True
text:FAQ: How do I pick the right size buying online?	labels:Buy something from Uniqlo—they are cheap, decent quality, and all of their items have detailed measurements—and just compare other retailer’s sizing info to ‘qlo stuff you already own.	episode_done:True
text:FAQ: How do I pick the right size buying online?	labels:Easiest way? Buy a measuring tape and measure yourself or your best fitting articles of clothing. Noting that your exact body measurements is your bare minimum (and you never need to go that slim anyways).   Uniqlo, Proper cloth, ledbury, kamakura shirts, all have in depth sizing guides, with proper cloth giving you example measurements depending on your fit and data provided. I suggest starting from there with regards to important measures to follow.  Denim websites and similar offering boutiques usually offer measuring guides as well, especially for jeans. Some boutiques like self edge, blue owl have a database to search for jeans based on measurements. Very nifty.  Honestly, its quite a bit of research to buy the right size the first time around. The most foolproof way is to buy multiple sizes and return. That being said, its not always the most economical, location, and/or shipping policies don’t allow this. Barring that, asking the sales team and cross referencing sizing with other vendors’ resources, reddit threads, official company sizing guides, will be your best bet.  Now all said and done, with tops usually measurements like chest, body length, sleeve length, shoulder length may be sufficient. Technically armhole size also matters but is usually never provided, rarely the armhole size will matter as they are in proportion to the aforementioned measurements.	episode_done:True

text:Arc'teryx Radsten Parka (2020) Review	labels:For what it's worth, I have the camosun, one level up in warmth from the radsten. Uses a slightly thicker synthetic insulation and also adds some down, and it keeps me comfortable down to -20C easily, no matter how much wind there is.  Otherwise a lot of what you mention here is valid in terms of construction between the two coats.
text:yeah the camosun might have been a slightly better fit for me. I am pretty happy with my radsten anyway, but wouldn't go any colder with it then the weather in vienna rn. When ordering I was afraid that the camosun would be too warm, which I think it could also very well be. So I chose the one where I thought that it would maybe be a bit too cold instead of too warm and having to sweat. I think that I might pick up a good fleece or thermal underlayer and that should do the trick for the cold days. :)	labels:That's a really good point!  I only start to wear the camosun around 0 degrees and have other lighter coats for above that. Really depends on what your needs are, since winter in Canada can get a bit more extreme than austria.
text:yeah the only other jackets I have (besides the UNiqlo one that I hate) is just a very light nike acg jacket with primaloft insulation and an old lightly insulated barbour coat which I had to wear together at about 5C.   I remember when first checking out this sub not realising how fcking cold canada can be and thinking that I'd need a therme with a down jacket and fleece underneath haha	labels:	episode_done:True

text:4SDesigns FW21	labels: 4S Designs is a relatively new brand, whose first collection was Fall-Winter 20 as things were going absolutely haywire in the world.  A lot of talent working for the brand, with the key designer being Angelo Urrutia. Angelo worked for the Nepenthes brands and Engineered Garments for god knows how many years (Through FW18 if I remember right?). Angelo is commonly known as Daiki's right-hand man, and from an outside perspective seems to have nearly as much influence in the brand's growth as Daiki has.   4s is definitely a different animal than EG. Still a workwear influence to be sure, but the styling is a little more conventional.   Fabrics are even crazier and much more lux than most of what EG has used - a lot of stuff that seems to be made special for the brand. Chanel-esque lurex-laden tweeds, soft and bulletproof melton, heavy twills, and ventile keep the choices interesting. Similar to EG, there have been many unconventional uses of fabrics.    While I don't think Angelo and team are aiming for the Conceptual collections ala Rick Owens, I think they nail an absolutely wearable aesthetic. Their lookbooks have been "different" but are one of the few brands that are unlikely to alienate people. With that, the details are still interesting enough to keep a normal enthusiast interested.	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - February 15, 2021	labels:# How acceptable are tailored shorts really as you get older?  I am reconsidering my outfits for my planned summer vacation in Italy.  I had planned for the daytime white, light blue and light pink slim-fit polo shirts, paired with light blue, pale red, and pale yellow tailored shorts. Boat shoes and Espadrilles for footwear. Basically my tried-and-true combos for hot weather vacays.  But as I reach the tail-end of my late 30s, **I wonder if shorts are appropriate at all anymore**. I always strive to look extremely put together, rarely wear anything without a collar, no denim, etc.  Shall I just wear my night-time outfits (pants and long-sleeve button-down shirts, both in linen or linen-cotton mix, in white and light pastel colors) during the day also?  Looking forward to feedback mainly from well-off guys my age or older.

Brunello Cucinelli is nice, but you can get nicer for the same price. They don’t really have any handwork and their designs aren’t that interesting for the most part.

text:The inspiration of vintage leisure and sportswear	labels:wow its almost like Simon reads Street x Sprezza lol, its almost like his take on that tailoring-adjacent essay I wrote 2 years ago!   This is great! Hopefully more people understand that these ideas are cohesive and can be applied liberally to classic clothing of all formality types. Though I will say that it's important to remember era: Scott Fraser definitely takes inspiration from 50s-60s leisure wear whereas most of the ideas here are taken from 30s-40s photographs. There are small nuances to pay attention to, but overall its cool to take vintage inspo.

text:Elk IV Parka from Wuxly Movement	labels:I don't see how canada goose promotes animal abuse. The down is never live plucked and the fur is sourced from animals that are killed by the state because of overpopulation
text:The issues people have is with how the fur is obtained, and a large portion of CG's fur is obtained through trapping. And trapping is generally looked down on as the animal can remain in the trap for days or even weeks at a time suffering. Are coyotes extremely overpopulated in a lot of areas of Canada and need to have their population culled? Yes, absolutely, and anyone trying to argue otherwise is a fool that doesn't understand the negative effect coyotes have on local animal populations. But allowing these animals to suffer for so long isn't the way to go about it. So the main crux of the issue is that yes, the fur is technically obtained legally and from a severely overpopulated species, but the way that it's obtained isn't ethical and shouldn't be encouraged.  This being said, CG has pledged to switch to "reclaimed fur" (whatever that means) starting in 2022.  Oops, kinda glazed over the down part. I've personally never seen anyone slate CG for how they collect their down, it's the fur that's the issue. Apologies for misreading at first. Though apparently it took them until the end of 2019/start of 2020 to become 100% RDS (responsible down standard) certified so maybe there were issues I haven't heard about...	labels:	episode_done:True

text:This is unhelpfully reductive and doesn't really address the issue in a way that makes sense. Down vs. synthetic is a tradeoff based on use cases, not a simple matter of one being better for everything.	labels:If one wants to make an ethical argument, thats up to them.  But down in a parka that has a waterproof shell is never going to lose against synthetic. Especially down which has been treated to not absorb humidity.   In sleeping bags, or for technical layers, there are more tradeoffs. But the OP already put themselves into the bucket of style/weight where Down is going to win across the board.   Synthetic can win on price (and get close to matching other considerations). But not $600 synthetic.	episode_done:True
text:Recent Purchases - February 14, 2021	labels:I bought a pair of American Eagle slim black jeans for $30. I don't think it's too bad a price and their slims fit me pretty well. Last summer, I bought the same fit, but in a dark rinse with 2% elastane (they're so comfy). This new pair will be 100% cotton, or so they claim. With shipping, the price ballooned to $38. I'm not happy, but I didn't want anything else from American Eagle.  I expect a fair bit of wear out of them. I did a cost per wear analysis and if I wear them once every other day for a year, I will pay 22c per wear. I don't even wear actual pants that often, especially in these COVID times. So I can reasonably cut the wear down to 1/4 of the year and extend the lifetime to 2 years (assuming the jeans fail at the end).   Wanna know what's more reasonable? 52 days of the year. I'll wear the jeans once a week, 3-8 hours per wear. I have many other pants I can wear when I'm not wearing those black jeans. Once a week for 7 years will amount to ~10.4c per wear.	episode_done:True

text:Andrew Marc New York Leather Jackets -- exploring the different "grades" of this brand	labels:Most current Andrew Marc outerwear is coming out of a licensing company called GIII. They handle outerwear for labels like Cole Haan, Karl Lagerfeld, Levi’s, Tommy, and quite a few others. The quality is going to be low to medium at best.   I wouldn’t pay much for it.
text:THANK YOU! This is precisely the kind of info I'm interested in.  When I look at the quality of recently made Andrew Marc... I'm underwhelmed. Then go to their site and see. They'll have garments with a so-called MSRP of "$695" with a discounted price then a promo price reducing it to $295". So really, that original price tag is nonsense and not indicative of that level of quality.	labels:All of this should have been the first sign that it's garbage.
text:And your comment helps... how?  This article is focused on the vintage Andrew Marc. Have you owned one? The leather is terrific quality for the price, if you know which style releases to look for. The fact that recent production is a notable drop in quality means you can find "gems" in older releases. If you think that's a joke, then the only reason why you're here is to troll.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Andrew Marc New York Leather Jackets -- exploring the different "grades" of this brand	labels:What is Andrew Marc quality comparable to?
text:From my own experience, I'd say the best made "vintage" Andrew Marc leather jackets are better than a lot of "mall" brand leather jackets I've owned or tried like Kenneth Cole, Tommy Hilfiger, Reilly Olmes, Ralph Lauren Chaps. I have a Ralph Lauren POLO leather jacket (original MSRP $695) from 1999 made of a heavy leather that has held up wonderfully over the years and I'd say is better than the best Andrew Marc I've tried (but my experience is limited--there may be "gems" out there, like limited editions).	labels:90s Polo is kind of golden era polo, somewhat different to what we have 20 odd years later.      RL Polo iteration one happens in 67' , RRL comes in 93', and then Purple label is in 94', but over the years I think the gap in quality has really widened sadly.
text:Polo is the hardest sub-brand to place. To simplify, there are two different tiers: department store Polo and RL store Polo. If you buy it from a department store  you'll get clothing at that level -- made pretty cheaply, a lot of basics, materials aren't special, etc. I can't remember if suits are half or full canvassed  At an RL or Polo store, though, some of it is pretty good. They have runway stuff. Some cowichans that will remind you of RRL's. I don't know if they still make Polo suits in the US or Italy, but if they do, those might be fully canvassed. Maaaybe some c&j footwear, although that's still mostly RLPL. Of course, most of this stuff will be overpriced, and still not actual RRL quality.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Andrew Marc New York Leather Jackets -- exploring the different "grades" of this brand	labels:Never heard of this brand, not really my style but I like this thorough deep dive and use of photos! Interesting read, nice job.
text:Thank you. What I showed is just some of what they've offered. They did produce other styles, like moto and cafe racer, though not as prolifically as the more traditional bomber, field, and blazer.  If Andrew Marc had only improved over time rather than cheapen, I'd have spent more time and gone into more detail. But after acquiring one of these nicer examples hidden among the cheaper ones, I thought it would be worthwhile to share what I learned. If you know what to look for, you can pick up some seriously nice deals for not much money.	labels:	episode_done:True

It also feels kinda funny buying made in India/China stuff with purely American heritage designs for x2-x4 times the price of many other repro brands.  Not to say that designs don't absolutely rip.

text:Boba's Ultra Basic Steps For Developing Style and Outfits (version 1)	labels:I've taken a couple of laps before writing this comment, but up-front I think aesthetics section should be split, because I think the most basic question, which is answered aesthetically but not functionally, is what do you want your clothes to **do**? Giving off a vibe is mentioned, but there's an even more functional level of "are these clothes sensible for how I live my life?" Are you buying lots of hawaiian shirts even though live at the north pole, or buying down parkas when you live in Hawaii? Do you regularly find yourself cold and wet because you don't own any raincoats, or find that your fishnet sleeves keep getting caught on the mill in the machine shop, or that your raw denim really doesn't give you the flexibility you need to dance?   I think what the clothes do should meet you where you do what you do, and at the most basic level that's physically enabling you to do things, and you can build a vibe from that.

text:While I agree with you, I don’t think a large segment of of the world aspires (strongly at least) to dress vastly different from what makes sense to Wear in their climate. I don’t think there are guys who work at the factory and dress up in bespoke suits; they’re smart enough to discern context.  Even urbancomposition, a union electrician, is able to dress how he wants, and that means dressing for his context.   I also think figuring out your aesthetic is also finding how to mix context with what vibe you want. Cotton knitwear turtlenecks exist, so you can definitely wear a roll neck in LA (within reason). There are cotton flannel aloha shirts that are long sleeve.  You can have a linen over shirt or a flannel overshirt. Open weave, high twist wool suits exist as much as flannel and tweed. Flannel lined chinos are a thing.  Apart from drastic things like wanting a to wear outerwear, there are definitely ways to make a personal desired aesthetic work for your context.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Boba's Ultra Basic Steps For Developing Style and Outfits (version 1)	labels:This is a fantastic resource Boba! You’ve put into words a lot of the smaller aspects of looking at construction outfits really perfectly, I’d consider myself at least marginally better dressed and this is still a really helpful method of approaching fashion.  >What is your relationship with gender and identity within fashion?  In particular may be the hardest question to actually answer here(or maybe that’s just me), the past year or so I’ve very much been questioning my sexuality and as a whole I’ve never exactly felt like I identified with or liked traditional masculinity, I’d say my current wardrobe leans much more heavily into categorically masculine items and fit and it’s def something I’ve been wanting to shift away from.   I’m like tiny and prefer high crops anyway so I really need to just start embracing more womenswear but I’m lazy and haven’t bothered to learn about womenswear brands uet
text:Thank you for the kind words :) I wrote the list and even I will go back through and do my own homework assignment because I think categorizing your tastes and then zooming back can be a great way to guide you through your own aesthetic. Doing fashion can become so overwhelming!  And yes that is a heavy hitter of a question. As a queer person I also have been wondering what my relationship to "mens"wear is. I ordered my first women's shirt a few months back and wow is it liberating. My answer to that question would be that I like to kind of blend things from the now decaying bi-gender system. In the same outfit I like to wear feminine clothing right next to something that I perceive as masculine (here in the midwest athleisure is the most masculine dress type) because with my minimalist, meditative taste I think it can look chic and balanced. :) thank you for sharing your experience.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Boba's Ultra Basic Steps For Developing Style and Outfits (version 1)	labels:What a beast of a post Boba, love ya for this  I think something that newbies need to do is go out and explore what’s out there to develop their visual and textural vocabulary. Obviously tougher with COVID, but that’s one of the best things about thrifting — even if you don’t purchase anything, the sheer volume of weird and wacky stuff out there will help you realize what’s out there, especially touching and feeling materials. Best part is that it costs nothing to window shop!

text:Boba's Ultra Basic Steps For Developing Style and Outfits (version 1)	labels:This guide is actually really comprehensive and goes into the finer details. I think it’s easy to be like “just look at the basic bastard and go from there” and even some of the guides on the sidebar aren’t that great or informative. Developing a style takes time, takes years and a lot of mistakes in choices. Still I think taking a moment outwardly and asking “what do I want my style to be” and using the questions really would have had me avoid some of the mistakes I made and maybe sped me up to where I am now
text:Absolutely agree. Learning the technicalities behind stuff is great and all, but you really need to hash out your own taste otherwise that stuff is useless. I think having a style journal where you reflect and elaborate more is great. What kind of style, shape, fabrics, colors, patterns, etc are all questions you need to answer to develop better style. Having a journal or way to reflect on prompts gives you not only a think tank for you aesthetic but it also can inform how you purchase and style things. Lots of beginners just have no idea how to start developing, I certainly didn’t.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Assuming you're not trying to troll, I'll give you a solid answer.   I went to schools that had uniforms, for 8 years, the same thing ad infinitum. I love high fashion/couture and its been like that since I was a kid. It's art. I used to just admire the looks that came down the runway. Now when I look at lines, I put them in my cart and buy what I like *(on sale cause retail is for suckerssss).* I can't be bothered with business casual looks & fast fashion like H&M, Gap, Asos, J. Crew, etc. I'm simply sharing my aesthetic. Not everyone likes an abstract Picasso, but they understand that it's art nonetheless.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Both.   Most of regulars here are hobbiest, we’re more interested in fashion than the average person, and that means pushing the envelope a little bit, I don’t love everything in this album but I think it’s all pretty wearable tbh.  You also gotta keep in mind a runway show is by definition meant to show off the skill of the designer both in design and styling, obviously runway shows and look books are going to be more out there, it’s akin to art gallery, would you wanna pay to visit the MET and find out the entire thing is full of Thomas Kinkade paintings? How people actually style the items they buy is often much less out there and easier to digest.  I also think people not involved in the fashion world have a bad habit of assuming brands or designers are “telling you” to wear things which...look I don’t know where this idea springs up from, I guess the idea that people who like fashion are all vapid and shallow and just following trends dor the sake of it.   It isn’t true, the people here are making clothing that they want to make(obviously business and being able to sell this comes into play so if anything it's being toned down), it’s not telling you you need to go out and buy any of it, if it’s ok to not enjoy this and just move on.   So, yeah, most of this(that I like) I’m approaching from the standpoint of seeing things I’d like to incorporate into my wardrobe. And what I don’t want to I can usually appreciate just as art	labels:	episode_done:True

However i think that because of all the raised environmental awareness i don’t believe synthetic fabrics have any future but rather organic fabrics such as a cottons or wool etc.
text:I think synthetic fabrics are definitely here to stay and evolve tbh. They’re engrained in general fashion because of its military heritage. But, I notice some techwear fits overlook a lot of good organic fabrics. They’re classics that work for certain climates just as good as synthetics, or tech clothes. Well made Wool clothing is the best, and has great properties. Wool is a very technical material that’s been used for a LONG time. Cotton is alright for hot days, it’s major disadvantages are how much water it absorbs, and in really cold environments it’s dangerous if wet, or when sweating.	labels:Yes synthetics are here to stay for sure and i can totally see the military wearing uniforms made out of cheaper materials etc...  But synthetic fabrics havn’t been around for that long and it has already caused major environmental pollutions. It had it’s break through in the 1960’s so in this short amount of time it has caused a disaster already. Every time we laundry polyester or synthetics micro fibres releases and polluting our ocean water, so the fish get it in them which we eventually get back in our bodies again when we consume fish for example.   So even if it’s here to stay i’m longing for it to be taxed to the degree where it is not profitable to produce it anymore.   And absolutely yes! Wool is defenetily the best way to go. It keeps you warm as it releases steam from the body which keeps the wearer in a better state. While synthetic clothes on the other hand causes a ”thermos” effect which forces the wearer to compensate with more laundrying and tons of parfume because of all the sweating.   Cottons is for sure not as good but it still ”breathes” in a way that synthetics doesn’t and can be made in many different ways depending on which season. Brushed to turn it into cozy flannel or corduroy for colder climate or denim or percale for warm weather.   My overall feeling tells me that we will move towards buying more consiously and less clothes of higher quality (since synthetics will be taxed too high anyway) in the future but to take better care of what we bought and therefore the trends will slow down a bit and leave people less anxious to feel constantly outdated and forced to buy the latest all the time. Which is ridiculus when you think about it.

text:I don't mind the wrinkly nature of linen but is there any "soft linen" or does soft linen imply a blend with a less environmentally friendly material?	labels:Linen gets softer as it ages usually, the opposite of cotton.

text:FAQ: What is the environmental impact of different fabrics?	labels:Anything that's sustainably farmed will have a positive or neutral environmental impact. Traditionally raised cattle for example extract carbon from the atmosphere so therefore the environmental impact of suede would be positive unless you're shipping the fabric long distances.
text:Eh, that's not really true. There are a number of environmental impacts from leather/suede. Even when sustainably raised.  1. Cattle actually suppress growth of native grasses(coming from a US centric perspective) due to the shape of their hooves. Buffalo have a different shaped hoof (more of a spade) and actually stimulate growth. So if you got your hands on some buffalo hide boots thats a great start.  2. The dyes and softening agents can be incredibly toxic and harmful. Traditional practices actually employ human excrement (both urine and feces) but modern practice focuses on more... palatable but also less environmentally friendly chemical agents.  3. Discerning origins of hides is difficult. There is quite a bit of disingenuous advertising as far as what is sustainably farmed and what standards it meets. There are many different verification organizations, looking into who has partnered with them (ie. NGOs or government programs) and who provided foundational funding is a good start to finding a reputable org.  So, you are totally right. But only if you account for all of those point as well as sourcing the materials/labor/sales locally. To be honest I think just making sure what you buy lasts a long time, taking care of your clothes/shoes, and limiting your future purchases will have a more meaningful impact.	labels:so, I'm an ag and soils researcher, and the research is really up in the air right now as far as grazing and soil carbon. we havent really figured it out yet, and the field is in a major state of flux with new research coming out all the time. maybe we can grow cattle in an environmentally friendly way that is carbon neutral or even positive (this would require much lower stocking rates and innovative new techniques that are far from common today), but maybe we can't	episode_done:True

text:Thank all of you	labels:Do not do what you are thinking about doing in the last part of your post. You are experiencing the beginner's high; you found something new and exciting and want to replace everything with it. One common rookie mistake for people that are new but not limited to fashion is to throw everything away and buy a completely new wardrobe only to regret it down the road because when the high went down, they realize they did not really enjoy some of the pieces.  You need time to process and enjoy your first part of AE. Let the initial 'honeymoon phase' calm down and see if you really like shoes. If you do and want to spend money, there are thousands of great shoe brands ($$-$$$) that you can read up on /r/goodyearwelt. AE is just a starting point.
text:As I mentioned to another poster I am going to give it some time to make sure. But at this point I am less trying to go ‘all in’ on AE than I really never want to put on my old shoes again. I wear dress shoes to work every day plus a few evenings for work commitments. Assuming the ones delivered are as comfortable to wear as the ones in the store my choices would be keep wearing painful shoes most of the time or spend a bit on AE’s.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Thank all of you	labels:So a number of people are telling you not to buy a bunch of AE shoes because they are “entry-level” and that you may eventually want to move up in price. This is true, but consider that anyone saying this has become a hobbyist who appreciates and collects high-end footwear, and therefore retroactively views AE as a gateway drug that led them to discover a new hobby. This implies a linear progression from spending $350 on shoes — an amount 98% of men would find insane — to eventually spending $1000+ on shoes, which is completely bonkers to all but a very small number of people.  Definitely wait a bit and avoid buying a dozen pairs of AEs too quickly. But also consider that if AE makes you happy and your goal is to amass a rotation of multiple good-quality shoes in different styles and colors, it’a perfectly acceptable to avoid leveling up. You don’t *have* to keep buying progressively more expensive stuff, and can instead enjoy what’s in a price tier you’re comfortable with.
text:>You don’t have to keep buying progressively more expensive stuff, and can instead enjoy what’s in a price tier you’re comfortable with.  This is one of the most level headed responses on the page and something that resonates with me. Basically all of my shoes are in the $300-$450 USD range and while I like having quality shoes and want to talk about GYW shoes and raw denim and stuff, it just is unfathomable for me to spend US$500+ on shoes at this time. Maybe when I'm making $200k a year I can think about spending that kinda money on shoes but it just doesn't make sense to me.  And, truly, if you're buying even a pair of AEs. If you don't wear them like a tool box, you will have them for years to come anyway.  Some of the other brands like Enzo Bonafe, John Lobb, etc, that other people have rec'd might not end up resonating with OP. They might, but they don't have to. I can appreciate people opening OPs eyes to other high end brands but it isn't necessary to buy them.  Hell, my most complimented shoes I have are a pair of Cole Haan Zero Grand sneaker oxford hybrids that my SO made me buy.  So a lot of the time, buying the high end shoes is only gonna matter to one person, that being the wearer. So buy whatever you want. Just make sure you do your best to get it to fit right.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Thank all of you	labels:Hey man, I know how you feel. Funny enough, I'm also 9.5EEE in AE. If you are okay with used shoes, try eBay or other resale websites for your size. They're out there. When I started a new job, I got three pairs of AE shoes in my size for about the cost of one new pair and they all came in pretty good shape.
text:I am not opposed. But the cost isn’t really an issue either. I just never got the point of expensive shoes before. I tried on expensive ones and they hurt just as much as the cheap ones. So why bother... I feel like a whole new world just opened up.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Thank all of you	labels:I'm so glad you were able to experience well-fitting shoes!  Allen Edmonds used to be the default recommendation back on MFA and GoodyearWelt, but they've fallen by the wayside in favour of places like Meermin which offer more absolute value.   One thing that I think people really don't take into account though is how vital AE's customer service is for someone just getting into good dress shoes – they're not going to have a good understanding of how a dress shoe should fit, and the staff at AE are really great at getting that across as well as finding the right size.  Once someone has gotten some experience, then they're more equipped to try better value brands with an online-only or foreign presence. But that initial guidance is critical and in my opinion, worth the "premium" that AE charges over Meermin
text:I wasn’t kidding knowing what I know now, I would have happily paid $400 just for the shoe fitting. I just never realized how much I needed it.   At this point I am thinking the shoes I bought were free and I paid for some really good customer service and the time of an expert.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Suit Supply Review Times Two	labels:While we can't say for certain: is it possible that the second experience is the correct one? A lot of men believe that they need a fully custom suit to fit well, but in actuality for most body types the patterns are rather close. If an OTR size with alterations would look great, paying for MTM is a waste of money. I've done MTM suits and bought OTR suits and have generally found that getting OTR with alterations is a faster way to a well fitting suit than the low to mid level MTM stuff we're talking about here. I've done Indochino MTM which was generally a mess and a tuxedo from Black Lapel which eventually worked out well, following one full remake and $100 of local alterations (that they paid for). My OTR blue line suits from SS fit great after alterations.
text:I know this is hard to do, but I really think men committed to getting a great fitting suit within a reasonable price need to try on several OTR companies and stick with the one whose cuts fits the best with the least needed alterations. I've done that with SS; their Havana and Lazio cuts fit me perfectly, and I only need to get the pants hemmed.  Unlike Spier & Mackay for me, whose $199 liquidation suit needed $240 of tailoring in NYC. At that price, plus the extra slight risk of returns since they're in Canada, I'd rather stick with SS despite them lacking in more conservative fabrics when compared with Spier. But for some people, Spier fits them the best, whereas SS is too slim.	labels:Agree 100%. Most of the go-to's offer free exchanges as long as it's your first suit, so it's not at hard as it seems.

text:Yes, I even considered this. It is possible that all the fuss associate with a MTM may just create work and not contribute much to the overall fit. I'm kind of build weird though...rather "wide" with a 36 inch waist, but not pudgy at all. My legs and arms are really thin, so I look like I am completely swimming in most OTR jacket sleeves and trousers. My SS OTR trousers I have do fit well, but not as well as the perfectly tapered MTM ones.  I failed to mention that I own an OTR SS Sienna as well, which I bought online and had altered. The MTM one fits much better, but it's mostly sleeves, shoulders and trousers....so basically all of it.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Suit Supply Review Times Two	labels:I too had two different experiences.  My first suit I purchased at the Philadelphia store.  They sized me at a 46R and I paid over $100 for alterations.  I lost about 20lbs in the following years and needed to get the suit altered.  This time I took it to the KoP store where they said I should not have been sized at a 46R and had to pay $100 in alterations.  They sized me for a new suit and minor alterations at no charge to me.	episode_done:True
text:Suit Supply Review Times Two	labels:I’ve also dealt with suitsupply twice and like you had two very different experiences.   In the first - a blue suit - I had a very clear idea of what I wanted and ordered it shipped to store so that I could just do minor tailoring. They took full measurements on every aspect of it, and asked what I wanted for each measurement too. Ie Do I like a wider pant opening? Or more tapered? Length of sleeves, etc. felt very much like a whole rundown of the entire suit.   The second was... bizarre if im being honest. I went in wanting to shop for a dark grey suit. I didn’t have a clear idea of what I wanted, but I was assuming I’d go the fully customized suit route and had toyed a bit with that on their website. I went in to the store to see fabrics and stuff in person before I made my purchase. I told them what I was planning and they basically took my chest measurement and then pushed me to not do the full customized, but instead buy off the rack. And for my color options, I was browsing the whole rack, but they straight up pointed me at only the grey tones they had in store at the moment in my size. When I asked about other shades I saw they basically said “yeah, we don’t have that one in your size” and stared at me. It was like the concept of ordering a fabric/color combo I liked in my size was a foreign concept to them. Measurements were weird too. They only measured and marked one pant leg and one sleeve for tailoring. I asked why he wasn’t doing the other sleeve/pant leg or any other measurements and he just said they weren’t necessary. I overall felt pushed around by the process, and rushed, and definitely don’t think the suit is as personally tailored to fit me as the first I bought.   Nevertheless, now I’m looking at getting a new blazer and again I’m looking at SS because the quality and fabrics are quite, quite good, and I don’t have many other MTM/customizable suiting options in my area.
text:Your second experience is very much of a piece with mine. Perhaps they are trying to treat MTM as more "factory alterations"? Thanks for the response.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Suit Supply Review Times Two	labels:I’m going to agree with a couple of comments in here and say that the second experience at SuSu wasn’t *wrong*.  The outcome of getting a custom suit isn’t only contingent on what the client asks. Since a “perfect” fit is a subjective concept, each custom fit is a confluence of not just the client’s requests, but also the individual preferences of the fitter and the standard cut of the brand. That is, it’s not just about where you go; it’s about who you work with when you get there.  I’m an associate for SuitSupply myself, and we all do a lot of custom. At the shop, each of the associates design custom suits a little differently. I almost always heighten the rise on the trousers, for example, and cut my chests really close. My coworker, on the other hand, always does a full leg taper and shortens the jacket a half centimeter. I’ve had clients switch from me to someone else and vice versa for custom because they liked an individual’s fit better.  With all of those adjustment options at your disposal, it’s easy to get anxious if you’re not seeing them all getting used. Remember, though: if your suit doesn’t fit right, alterations and remakes are free, and the changes are noted so they can be added to the next suit you make. If you go back and let them know during the fitting about your prior experiences and how you want it to fit, or even bring in your original suit to guide the process.  I would give SuSu another chance. But I’m biased.

text:Suit Supply Review Times Two	labels:They offer a "from scratch" option on the website. Don't start from anything, have them measure you and make that jacket. They're being firmly lazy with you, you have to be firm and demand a good fit.  The store I walked into, the guy promised that their new "custom - from scratch" option included things like armhole size, shoulder slope etc. So that has to be the way to go.  Contact Black Lapel and see if they can do that. If not....  Where are you? Kent Wang MTM offers a *ton* of options, but it's NYC only. There's Spier and Mackay, Imparali... What's your budget, around $1200?
text:Thank you for this!  As an update, I spoke to SS HQ this morning. They canceled and refunded me. The representative told me that MTM is no longer in existence. I told them it still says it is available in select markets on their website and they stated that what they offer now is call, "Advanced Alterations" internally and is branded, "Custom Made".  I clarified that with them because it was a shock to me.  My prior suit was purchased under their true MTM program which no longer exists.  The new advances alterations platform does include armhole height, sleeve circumference, waist, chest, shoulder so it doesn't seem like much is being lost. My feedback to them was that the rep should still measure you and should customize every measurement because what are the chances that I happen to be exactly the same waist, chest and shoulder as your 42" pattern. She thanked me for the feedback and said the experience should still include full measurement, but something has been lost in translation as they roll out the new platform.   For a suit I can go $1200, but I'd like to get a blazer done under the SS price of $650.  The most I've ever paid for a suit is $1500 and that was Alan David NY.  I loved their work, but they get expensive fast when you start looking at nicer fabrics. I'm still considering going to another SS and getting properly fitted via this program because I like the totally unstructured shoulder for this more casual blazer.   Does Kent Wang travel or do I have to come to them?	labels:Traveling tailors are hard to find on even a $1500 budget... This would be easier if you could tell me what the nearest city was.
text:Orlando. I flew to NYC for Alan David and willing to do so again, but that turns a $1500 suit into a much more expensive one, obviously.	labels:Yeah... I don't know many shops in Orlando. Supply and Advise is a great store in Miami, next time you're there, but I'm not sure if they do anything MTM.  For NYC... You could always just go and get measurements on file at a few places. Kent Wang, black Lapel, the Armoury, Mr. Ned, Martin Greenfield, Imparali, et cetera. And visit No Man Walks Alone and Turnbull and Asser and Meermin and Carmina and... We've got a pretty large number of menswear stores worth visiting.  Buuut I wouldn't fly up for just one jacket. Get a tailor to measure the shit out of you, tip him $10-20, and keep those measurements on file, they're yours, you won't lose them like SS did. Then try to get a shirt mtm online (Spier and Mackay, Proper Cloth, Luxire, Black Lapel, Alton Lane...) And see how that goes for you. Online MTM suiting is trickier, but you know... Give it a try.

text:Stop Dressing For Your Height [Tim Dessaint]	labels:Great video, thanks for sharing.  Particularly liked this excerpt around the 3-minute mark that a lot of people need to hear:   > The problem I find with dressing to maximize your perceived height is that 1, it puts height on a pedestal-- it assumes that your height is the most important factor for determining your attractiveness--and 2, it assumes you should dress to maximize your attractiveness to others... you are dressing with one priority, to look taller and more attractive to the eyes of other people and the result of that is a sea of men dressing the exact same way... where is the personality in that? The soul? Creativity... do you know how cool it is to dress in a unique way that's authentic to you and walk around in the utmost confidence?	episode_done:True

text:Review: Church's McPherson Brogue Derbies with Commando Soles	labels:Great review!  Totally agree re: church's, I've got a pair of their cornwood (Chunky Chelsea boots) which I got around 40% off last year and they're brilliant, they're a tumbled leather so have a softer grain to the embossed calf but have held up to my abuse brilliantly. I've noticed that Church's are excellent at the clicking process and only the highest quality hides make it in (in my experience, they're the only brand I've never seen any inconsistencies in leather quality from).   My only complaint is the last (103 as opposed the the 133 on yours), it looks amazing but leaves me swimming at the heel with a relatively stubby toebox.  I agree too about C&J, their scotch grain is softer (and I'd argue maybe a little *finer*) than church's. But Church's firmer leather is not a bad thing for country shoes and is more in line with the Zug grain you see from Trickers.

text:MFA Brand MegaReview: Asket | February 6, 2021	labels:Oddly enough, I am wearing one of their hoody's as we speak, so it's a great time for my comments.  I actually interviewed one of their co-founders on my podcast, and decided to treat myself to one of their garments after being really impressed with their brand and company values. I wasn't sure what to expect in terms of product, but as soon as I unboxed the package, I instantly felt the quality in the weight of the hoody.   The organic cotton is soft to the touch, but there is substantial weight in the body of the hoody, which to me is exactly what I want in a garment that gives me comfort, especially in the winter.  I've only had the hoody for a month, but after 20 or so wears and the first wash, it looks like new, which is a great indicator of longevity.  Aside from the quality, I personally love everything Asket is about from an ethos perspective and have nothing but great things to say about my experience with them so far.  Five Stars, IMO.	episode_done:True

text:From 'Doctor Who' to 'Outlander': How Fans Craft Reverse Engineer Knits	labels:Thanks for sharing this article! I've been knitting for over 20 years, and I would love to try my hand at some replica design, I just have to get through more of my queue and stash first.   I'm always excited when pop culture knits inspire more people to get into knitting. I've found taking this step to make my own socks and accessories to be eye opening about the value of garments and clothing. And as one of the interviewed knitters said, it is very fun to chose different fibers and yarn weights to make exactly what you want in the project.
text:> just gotta get through more of my stash and queue first.  Narrator: "They were never able to do so."  But forreal, I just cast on my first self designed sweater. I've been knitting for a year, but crocheting and sewing for a decade. Slow fashion is such a rabbit hole because before you know it you're trying to talk yourself out of learning to spin, cause maybe when you buy a house you could get a sheep? Maybe some angora rabbits?! But it's such a cool interest. As a young person I'm really happy that it's becoming a mainstream thing!  It gives me hope.	labels:Yep...very accurate.  I have successfully not purchased yarn for myself for 458 days now (not like I'm counting), so I might be able to reduce the stash a bit. But more than likely I'll cave here in the next six months while I still have 40k yards to work through.   The rabbit hole of slow, self-made fashion goes deep. The yarn, the yarn dyeing, the desire for an angora rabbit, the realization that you dont like drop spinning, but thinking maybe you'd like it on a spinning wheel...

Way back when a suit or jacket is part of normal daily wear, people wear them over anything- think tweed work jackets over thick crew neck sweaters, with or without neckerchief. Tailoring used to be much more free-form compared to the generally more prescriptive "worsted-wool sharp businessman look" nowadays. Crew neck sweaters are basically the OG t-shirts, and easier to wear on its own since plain t-shirts were originally underwear and not meant to be seen.	episode_done:True

text:I also just don’t understand the inclination to “push it” when just about every guy who owns a tailored jacket also has a closet full of collared shirts. The right way to dress down a jacket is by going with a more casual button-down, not by opening up the t-shirt or hoodie drawer.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Can You Wear a T-Shirt Under a Blazer and Not Look Like an 1980s Leftover?	labels:This look working is dependent on a couple of things. The fit of the shirt and the jacket has to be on point. The fabric of the t-shirt should be higher-end cotton or similar material, can't be your run of the mill t-shirt. Most importantly though is the person wearing it, you've gotta be in shape to pull this look off or you look like a sloppy neckbeard.	episode_done:True

Drake's does an "archive" sale of past season stuff periodically, too. I picked up a shirt jacket for half-off last time.	episode_done:True
text:Dressing Drakes on a Budget	labels:Good write up on a good topic. I've specifically said that Drake's is visibly expensive before, a lot of these looks are hard to replicate for cheap... But you really have done a great job, at least with the simpler looks. Yes, styling and fit are huge factors.  And of course, materials are a big factor, particularly for their silk and shirting...   But the real magic in the brand is in specific details, color combos... The closer you can get to the exact color palette you're trying to imitate, the better. If you're looking at cord, don't just look at the cut and color -- think about the difference in wales per inch (IE the width of the cords), look at the buttoning method, and every detail you say you're not worried about, just know what you're sacrificing, because they have a real eye for detail.  (Or, do somewhat less work, and you'll still look pretty good, but details matter, that's all I'm really saying).	episode_done:True

text:The Instagram Account Showing “Ivy’s” More Eclectic Side – Put This On	labels:@berkely_breathes is an amazing account I highly recommend to follow on insta. The article gets into this, but the account dives into old thousands of old yearbook photos—which show off this “Ivy” style across both diverse people and people engaging in diverse activities. It really contextualizes how the “Ivy” approach can be for everyone and I think it deserves the recognition.	episode_done:True
text:The Instagram Account Showing “Ivy’s” More Eclectic Side – Put This On	labels:I really enjoyed this look at the truth behind the Ivy League style, rather than the generalization some people seem to have of it today.

Kids were tired of wearing the same uniform their fathers wore, so they decided to wear their sweaters under jackets, sneakers with ties, etc.

Generally not a problem for me; I only made an order with Topman once and it was because I had some vouchers to heavily reduce the price. I only considered Topman items when they were in the sale anyways.  Since I shop semi-regularly at ASOS, this change won't affect me too much. I'm not concerned about the uality of ASOS products either; they seem fine enough for what I need. I'd rather have a good quality item at a sensible price, than an excellent quality item at a much higher price than what I could possibly afford.	episode_done:True

Spotting in the rain is incredibly annoying so I’ve just avoided wearing them in high temps, whereas my calf boots are completely fine in summer. Also, they are on dainite soles which are terrible in winter snow or slush.   I’m glad I own a pair of color 8 Alden 986, and my Viberg bourbon shell service boots. They are great for certain occasions. But in sum, I have a pair of ~$1300 boots that I generally can wear between 40-75 degrees Fahrenheit when there’s no precipitation or inclement weather. Keep that in mind before you jump into the shell world.

text:Spotting is certainly a common complaint and I can see how it diminishes people’s enjoyment of shell boots. I live in a place with 250 days with rain per year and wear mine in all weather conditions (except old snow as I’m afraid of the salts). I have some semi-permanent spots on faded ravello, but have accepted them as part of the patina. My color 8, black and cigar shoes all deal really well with rain and mud and I find them much easier to clean than calf skin/cow hide boots. Now that I think of it, maybe there’s so much rain here that they now have ’even‘ stains. Shell shoes can be enjoyed as heavy beaters, I believe.	labels:	episode_done:True

It’s the coldest leather I’ve ever worn (like my feet are freezing even with medium wool socks). On the flip side, they are super warm in anything over 75 degrees so I avoid them in summer. Spotting in the rain is incredibly annoying so I’ve just avoided wearing them in high temps, whereas my calf boots are completely fine in summer. Also, they are on dainite soles which are terrible in winter snow or slush.   I’m glad I own a pair of color 8 Alden 986, and my Viberg bourbon shell service boots. They are great for certain occasions. But in sum, I have a pair of ~$1300 boots that I generally can wear between 40-75 degrees Fahrenheit when there’s no precipitation or inclement weather. Keep that in mind before you jump into the shell world.

text:Strange. I find them to be great hot weather wear, no warmer than calf (and cooler if unlined). Also have not had problems with permanent water spotting. I live on the equator and wear my shell in any weather.  ETA: That said, most of my shell is on the darker side (burgundy/colour 8, dark brown, black, or navy). I recommend these colours to those who are deeply bothered by water spotting.	labels:Similar experience here. I wear mine year round in Florida and don't really notice a difference between shell / calf leather as far as getting too hot. Usually what stops me from wearing boots is the weather gets so hot I don't want to wear pants so the boots go too. I can see how the spotting would annoy some, but I usually just don't wear them if I know it will rain. If they do get wet a quick wipe down with a damp cloth takes care of it for me.	episode_done:True
text:Outwear for a funeral?	labels:You really don’t have to worry about your outerwear at a funeral.  no one expects you to have a black top coat for these occasions.  just wear whatever keeps you warm and dry  I would not mix black separates together it won’t look good. Do you have a navy blazer? gray pants a navy blazer,  white shirt and somber tie is fine in a pinch. If you want to buy a suit just go to Macy’s and get a Bar III or equivalent in either navy or charcoal.  You may not be able to get alterations  done in time however.   Don’t overthink it remember it’s not a fashion show you just want to look appropriate. I’m sorry for your loss

text:Outwear for a funeral?	labels:I went to a Kohl's and bought myself a cheap black suit for the last one I attended. It is not anything of quality, but is at the very least appropriate and inoffensive. Slim cut, but not too skinny as to make it offensively so. It was sub-500. I paired it with a rather full cut white dress shirt and black tie.   It won't see much use in the future except for other funerals, and frankly, I don't see much issue with that. It's polyester-y and the shoulders are off, but there won't be much in the way of judgement about the minutia of it. Keep that in mind. As long as it's reasonably conservative, it will do.  I don't know exactly about what outerwear you could get. But I suppose thrifting a dark, conservative coat would be best. Black, Grey, Navy.	episode_done:True

text:FAQ: How do I know my clothes weren't made with slave labour?	labels:While not a direct answer to the question, I'll suggest that for those who are concerned about slave labor in the apparel industry and want to know what they can do to help... reduce, reuse, recycle.   You can reduce demand for new clothing by cutting back on clothing purchases where possible. If something doesn't fit quite right or is damaged, consider taking it to a tailor or mending yourself rather than immediately rushing out to buy a replacement.  When you want or need to buy something, consider buying used clothes instead of new where possible (easier than ever even if you don't have local thrift shops thanks to the rise of the secondhand menswear market on ebay, Grailed, TheRealReal, etc.).  Not that any of the above is a substitute for systemic change, but at least it can help you avoid becoming part of the problem.	episode_done:True
text:FAQ: How do I know my clothes weren't made with slave labour?	labels:Same as always, buy used, you can’t trust corporations to tell you the truth about their labour practices, in part because they have a very vested interest in not telling you the truth and in part because actually tracking he supply chains for clothing is incredibly difficult to do accurately, and, yes this applies to the cool mid range denim brand that replies to all your posts on ig. Even Patagonia got busted for using Slave Labor, if you look past the long winded apology letters they put out since they got caught, the reality is that it’s basically intrinsically locked into the supply chain of modern clothing production unless you're paying thousands upon thousands of dollars to have a local tailor make all of your clothes using locally sourced materials.  Buying used is the single most ethical option you have, and, frankly, is the better option anyway	episode_done:True
text:FAQ: How do I know my clothes weren't made with slave labour?	labels:As others have mentioned--you don't. The best way to avoid it is by thrifting since you're not adding to the demand for clothing production. A thrifted item could have been produced by slaves originally, sure, but your purchase of it doesn't contribute to that.  Also, contrary to what you might assume, in many cases companies that have gotten into trouble for abusing slave labor in the past are actually safer now. They overcorrect and invest in auditing to avoid the issue happening again. This only applies to companies who care about their brand in this way though, like Target.	episode_done:True
text:FAQ: How do I know my clothes weren't made with slave labour?	labels:Make em yourself. But then what if the textiles were produced using slave labor?   Buy the fibers and a loom.  But what if the processing facility that produces the fiber uses slave labor to harvest?   Honestly, unless youre willing to grow your own cotton, and raise your own silkworms, and process the raw materials into a finished product...shop thrift. Give that money to your local owner instead of into the hands of a bunch of companies that make you worry about whether theyre using slave labor.  The clothes at thrift might have been produced unethically, but the local owner profits 100% from the sale of the clothing, and it doesnt support the evils.  But you can definitely produce your own silk, your own cotton, all of it. Lots of people do it, its just super fringe and takes a lot of time and patience.   Edit:Looking at other comments, its nice to see this sentiment repeated over and over.	episode_done:True

text:Bruce Boyer on Finding Your Wardrobe and Sustainability in Fashion – Put This On (Derek Guy )	labels:Really good read as expected from Bruce. I know that sustainability is thrown around a lot and it can be a bit hypocritical or at least out-of-touch in regards to classic menswear. On the surface it can even seem elitist, since its a luxury, though Bruce here has shown that even he experimented and seems to encourage people to try different modes of menswear apart from trying to be timeless all the time.  I think it would be great if Bruce talked more about his taste, like why he liked George Cleverly and Anderson & Sheppard (I know he mentioned sensible lapels, etc).  I think diving into taste (or POV as it were) a bit more as it relates to menswear details would help show guys that while J. Crew suits and Meermin are fine and can last a long time with proper care, sometimes aesthetics for the sake of aesthetics win out in how we acquire clothing.
text:yeah that creeping need to want to 'upgrade' or have the 'best' is a big contributor to the unsustainability of fashion i feel like. Even though you could sell/donate the item, it may just end up being thrown away or shipped out.

text:In the interview Boyer mentions buying a custom three-piece flannel suit around 1965 for $125 — which would be $1,027 in 2020 dollars. That’s obviously quite a bit less than a similar piece would cost on Savile Row today, but it’s not like that was a cheap piece for a recent college grad at the time. I don’t know all the ins and outs around why the cost of tailored clothing rose faster than inflation, but I suspect it has a lot to do with the casualization of the Western wardrobe sharply reducing the demand for both bespoke clothing and its inputs (like wool), which meant the industry couldn’t profit from volume.  Inflation in particular seems to be an element people have difficulty mentally grappling with over time. If a guy grows up thinking a pair of jeans should cost $50, he’s likely to consider anything more than that outrageous even decades later, when the money is worth 3x less. I think this is an under-appreciated element of the race to the bottom in our clothing — it’s not just that Instagram encourages everyone to wear different clothes in every picture, it’s also that we’re conditioned to think price tags should never increase over time. The clothes most people wear every day are significantly cheaper than they used to be in real terms, and that was only made possible by using cheaper labor and cheaper materials.	labels:Furthermore, that generation wasn't really bothered by inflation, as the wages were generally keeping up with it. But since the late 70s, early 80s, wages have stagnated for most. I think this is the reason most people cannot justify saving for a higher quality item. Good quality garments nowadays are keep getting further out of reach for most.	episode_done:True

text:Could you say more about why those systems are unsubstainablr?   I'm not very rich, I would struggle to afford a house in my expensive city, but I have dropped a few thousand on a suit - made with good materials by a local bespoke maker.  I think extreme wealth gaps are unsustainable, for sure, but dropping a few thousand on a suit every couple of years isn't much more than people spend on a computer, out drinking, or on games and gaming systems. For me, it's a hobby I get to wear.	labels:One decent suit in any closet is always a must, a couple of times I got the job I was interviewing for simply because I wore a suit and tie to the interview.   Sustainability and changing trends are another can of worms which depend on the individual. Contemporary vs Classic, $300 suit which can be altered by a tailor vs $4,000.00 fitted suit. Like he said “buy the best you can afford and take care of your purchases”
text:> is always a must  It's not anymore though. For so many people wearing a suit just isn't needed outside of maybe a handful of events a year and at that point why bother spending anything more than a couple hundred?   You don't need a full canvas suit that's been made out of a fabric you picked for your measurements. Just like buy a navy worsted wool suit from J Crew on steep discount or any of the other many budget brands for suiting out there now.  You can vary easily do more than just get by with a suit that many people who browse here wouldn't even bother calling "decent". Many might not even need a suit at all. I can't remember the last time I needed to wear one.	labels:	episode_done:True

Menswear already has so many pieces on the torso (tie, jacket, shirt, pocket square, maybe vest) that things just feel too top-heavy if wearing a patterned jacket and solid pants.
text:Very good point! I've probably subconsciously agreed with you on this, as embracing solid jackets is a contrasting move against being top heavy. Though I haven't made the push to patterned pants yet; currently getting used to solid colors like purple or red!	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Hey! The vest over a sportsjacket is me! I too thought it was a bit bold — but I have seen it in some lookbooks before and decided to try it out. Without the lapels rolled over, it looks pretty atrocious, the parts of the jacket that stick out below the vest look misplaced. With the lapels pulled out there’s a little bit of continuity and the vest doesn’t dominate the upper body.   I definitely agree it’s not an everyday look, but for a layering challenge I thought I’d take a leap.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:I’m moving from California to Michigan. Best way to move my wardrobe?	labels:I moved across country. May be an unpopular opinion, but use the opportunity to clear out the wardrobe and free up some space. When I moved I sold off/donated probably half of my clothes and shoes. Otherwise, what I did:  \- Left everything that was in the dresser/drawers in there and moved them as one piece (even stuffed extra stuff in each drawer)  \- Space bags for all of my button downs (lots of ironing when I arrived)  \-  Anything that could tolerate it (like suits, wool coats, down jackets), I rolled, folded, etc and packed them into either space bags or just into boxes  \- Packed shoes into boxes as tight as possible (I don't keep the shoe boxes normally)  \- Anything of any high monetary or sentimental value (RMC leathers, a few of my favorite Vibergs/Aldens, etc) traveled with me in the car.
text:Thank you for the tips. I will look into the space saver bags. Are there any you’d recommend?	labels:I just bought the cheapest ones on amazon. I've never had good luck re-using them multiple times, so you just need something that will survive the move.	episode_done:True

text:What's Up With G By Guess?	labels:> Any thoughts?  It looks like stuff that ends up at Ross — cheaply made with nonsensical design elements.   If you like it, great, but I don’t think it’s a loss. Check secondhand markets for the remainders that are still floating around.
text:Their quality was better in 2010-ish. Designs too. But I did notice quality fading over time, as well as designs becoming more and more simple. The main GUESS brand has had this issue too. Sucks. I grew up loving the GUESS/G By Guess brands.	labels:The brand is definitely not even closely remote to what it used to be years ago, but I’ve been to one of the stores in Los Angeles and you can definitely find some quality pieces. I think it all depends on what you are looking for. Their denim is solid: not the best out there, but also not the worst. I would would wait for their sales, but I could see myself finding something to buy.	episode_done:True
text:What's Up With G By Guess?	labels:G by Guess, as you know it, is dead. Gone. The name will still exist, but it is basically a Guess Factory store. GBG has been struggling to perform well financially for a long time. The G by Guess design team does not exist anymore. Before COVID happened, Guess laid off the entire team, and the few designers/employees that survived were transferred to the Factory team. If you still want some quality, I suggest spending your money at the regular Guess stores. Their quality is still quite good in a lot of their clothing (accessories is a whole different story) and there is a dedicated Design team that still produces new collections every season. My source: I am close with several friends that have worked/are still working at the headquarter offices in Downtown Los Angeles.
text:Thank you so much for the insight. Yeah, the writing is on the wall. I know the brand was never popular since I always felt I was the only one buying their stuff. Sucks about the design team because the men’s stuff used to be good. Forever 21 had REALLY GOOD men’s stuff when the men’s line first debuted too, but they let go of a ton of designers too (many whom I heard were from GUESS).	labels:You’re welcome :) I actually met one of the Senior Designers working with the G by Guess team and he was actually really good. You can tell he was really creative and was able to design with the customer in mind. I do think that in the past few years they had a lot of limitations brought upon by upper management since the brand wasn’t performing as it used to. The brand, as a whole, is not what it used to be back in the days. Like F21, it’s days are long gone. Now, the company is only plagued by sexual allegations made against Paul Marciano, among other things. Not even their collaborations with J Balvin, JLO, etc. seem to do anything for them.
text:I think I’ve heard of the allegations but yeah as a long-time fan, I could notice design quality dropping GREATLY. Even for the mainstake GUESS brand. It sucks, really. And GBG never really got its footing in the market because it came out at a time when F21 and H&M started expanding in the US. And when you compare prices, people would rather pay less. GBG did have some unique stuff 2010-2012 it seems because that’s when I bought the most stuff from the brand.	labels:You’re absolutely right. GBG did not have a chance standing against the Goliaths that were F21, Zara and H&M. Their price points were much higher, with similar, if not the same quality. They did have more design injected into their clothing, but unfortunately customers tend to favor price over design and quality. Glad to know you were able to at least experience GBG at its peak :)
text:I wonder where all these designers went off to when GUESS/GBG let them go. Yeah I hated seeing GBG lose its flair out of nowhere. All their later designs became very plain. I have no idea what they’re doin now merchandising-wise by filling GBG stores with GUESS Factory stuff. Might as we just close the GBG stores. I guess corporate is still figuring something out and they are filling stores with non-GBG stuff in the process.	labels:I think most of them just went off to F21, or other companies in the LA area. Even when a brand is not doing well, the name alone still has some value. They are probably trying to hold on to whatever the name “G by Guess” still has in value. If they were to give up the name, they can potentially loose trademark/copyright of that name and it becomes available for anyone else to pick up if they show Guess not using that name. I think it is honestly all legalities.
text:Interesting. I wonder what value they see if it’s so obvious they’ve been on a decline for so long and ate scrubbing the name. It’d be odd to have the GBG sub-brand living under GUESS Factory forever. And it is sad the designers went on F21 because the stuff there (I am speaking for men) has declined so so much. When the men’s stuff came out in 2008, the designs and quality were SO good. Yes, it is fast fashion, but quality was so there. I bought F21 like crazy up till 2014 or so when quality started to slip. I met a guy who knew designers at F21 and said many from the initial Heritage 1981 men’s launch were pouched from GUESS (the irony).	labels:	episode_done:True

text:MFA Brand MegaReview: Zara | January 30, 2021	labels:2012 through about 2014 I was out of college, unemployed for stretches, underemployed for others, and underpaid for the rest. After being unemployed post-college in 2012 and living with my parents, and then my entire annual income in 2013 was about $13,000 while I was living on my own, and somewhere around $20,000 in 2014. I had some freelance gigs here and there where I could pull in $500 or $1000 bucks outside my reported income, but I was ostensibly "living in poverty" for a few years.  Zara was honestly kind of a godsend in that period, I needed somewhat fashionable clothing but had basically no money to spend on it. I work in the contemporary art world and dressing well is literally part of my job. While Zara isn't exactly highly respected, I was able to get some decent looking clothing on the cheap.  Today I find it easy to criticize Zara, whether it's the stolen designs, or the fast fashion model, or the inconsistent sizing, the sweatshop labor, and so on, but I admit that for a moment in my life they were a really useful utility. When I didn't have money for clothes but I needed decent looking clothes, Zara was one of the best options available to me. There's a lot of better options in the world if you have time and money, as I do now, but I'd be a hypocrite to ignore the benefit they provided me when I had neither time nor money.  Also while they're not exactly a "buy it for life" brand, their clothes didn't fall apart on me either, so, I'll give them props for that. Everything lasted an appropriate amount of time for the price.

text:MFA Brand MegaReview: Zara | January 30, 2021	labels:twice, I've coincidentally lived right next to a Zara (like a 2-3 minute walk). As a result I often popped into the store and bought a few things.  My experiences were hit and miss, mostly misses  Hits:    Faux suede stuff.  They look and feel nice. I've often get compliments on it. I don't like dealing with actual suede, so the faux stuff is nice.     Sizing. so far sizing for tops has mostly been consistent so its easy to order online and know what to expect  Returns. super easy either online or in person.  Sales. Here they go on sale immediately July 1 and Jan 1.  You can get good deals on many things such as a faux suede jacket for roughly 20 USD, a long coat for roughly 30, etc  Style.  I think thats the reason many go here.  The styling looks really unique and interesting. although yes, there are really strange stuff there too  Blazers/sport coats.  Fits well and looks nice.  Miss:  Stitching. Like some one said earlier, its really bad. things are always loose, buttons fall off, even buckles break. more than half of the Zara items I've bought had some major stitching issues within the first half year.   Jackets. although they are cool, I've had all kinds of problems. A bomber jacket where all texture threads became loose and made a hole.  A linen moto jacket where the buckle just broke off and fixing it costed more than the jacket. My Faux suede sherling denim style jacket looks great and new but all the button stitching around the button holes have all frayed.. and i hardly use the buttons since there are zippers!   Knits. unravels, pills quickly etc  all Bottoms. discolors easily. pills easily. tons of loose threading  when I was a college student it was nice. the sale items are cheap and you can look cool  but after graduating, having more disposable income, etc.. I've mostly moved on.	episode_done:True

It's my favorite jacket I've owned so far (apart from a lightweight bomber) and I find it both stylish and useful. I also love long jackets.  edit: I did not see which sub I was in sorry.

text:How Japan's Best Men’s Magazines Gained a Cult Following in the US	labels:Having traveled to Japan, I can second the exceptional quality of magazines there.  Or rather, magazines are no different in Japan than other things: some of them are just pure perfection due to the dedication and effort of their creators.  It is well known here in the sub that the same applies for Japanese denim and even for fast fashion like Uniqlo, among many other things.

text:How Japan's Best Men’s Magazines Gained a Cult Following in the US	labels:I love these magazines for their pictures and some articles, but I always felt a lot of them just end up being big ads for their friends stores/brands. Many of the ones made by the same publisher like Clutch, 2nd, Go Out, Lightning also just focus on buying with some short flowery description of the product and not much else. I’d like to see more stuff that involves lifestyle, articles, and stuff. Although it makes sense that the lack of this has brought in more readers from the west, more product pictures and less blocks of text. I also understand that the magazines scopes are limited so therefore they must retread the same discussions over and over.  Also the fact that Go Outs focuses mostly on glamping (glam camping, it was a top searched word in Japan last year) kills me as some one who loves outdoor stuff. It doesn’t have much in the way of actual camping, just setting up huge luxurious tents in an open field for the most part.  Maybe I’m just salty because all the magazines show cool stores but all of them are in Tokyo while never here in Kyoto.	episode_done:True
text:How Japan's Best Men’s Magazines Gained a Cult Following in the US	labels:I wonder if /u/Shrimp_My_Ride might be able to provide his perspective on the differences that the Japanese mindset/values have that result in such detailed products
text:Absolutely and thanks for the heads up. In my mind, it is two basic factors...devotion to principle and attention to detail.      The first is that when Japanese people choose a job or a hobby or something similar, they really make it the central focus on their lives. They tend to work way harder, spend way more time talking and thinking about it, and work much longer hours. If you have a magazine, not only the founder and main editors, but every little guy down to the smallest job will really devote themselves to that job, prioritizing it over their free time and identifying the purpose of their lives as to make that magazine the best it can be. Japanese people don't sit at work thinking about what they will do when they get off, they sit at home thinking about what they will do when they get to work.    Second, Japanese people tend to be VERY detail-oriented (read, anal-retentive). And they will have meeting after meeting or spend hour after hour on the tiniest detail. And maybe it's not anything that anybody would ever notice, but together it really forms the bigger picture. Just as an example, I am a shoe guy and a few weeks ago I tied my laces in something called the "berluti knot" to try something new. 10+ people the very first day at my company must have noticed it and asked questions about what it was, why I was using it, how to tie it, etc.    I could write more, believe me. And obviously these are generalizations and there are lazy, directionless Japanese people and those from other countries with these qualities as well. But speaking as an overall trend, this is why we see the uniqueness and quality of certain Japanese things.	labels:Love the shoe knot anecdote. That is attention to detail and bet made your day providing "tutorials" on how to tie that knot :)
text:I did exactly that. Though I should point out several women were interested as well, who at my workplace they generally don't wear shoes with laces. People asking questions about why, thinking about it, coming back to me with insightful comments later.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:What are "iconic" items that you should know about, and their basic history? What items can singularly be identified as "starting a trend"?	labels:Timberlands yellow nubuck boots have an interesting history, kind of the first major crossing of workwear and urban street wear. Depending on who you ask, it was drug dealers or just urban blacks started wearing insulated timberlands to keep their feet warm standing on the cold concrete late at night. Timberland was slow to embrace this new market, and that brought some controversy. If you believe that it was primarily drug dealers buying the boots you can understand why Timberland didn't want to develop that reputation, if you believe it was urban blacks then it looks a lot like racism. I tend to think they were trying market to construction workers, and were worried the urban buyers would be a shorter term market. In the end, there are plenty of better construction boots out there and they went where the money is greenest and have been an fashion staple ever since.  Buffalo check (red and black check) coats were originally full blown wool blankets that women would sew into jackets for their husbands logging in the PNW. Now it's just a popular pattern in general, and some people still swear by blanket coats.	episode_done:True

What items can singularly be identified as "starting a trend"?	labels:Hmmm, I would say Doc Martens started the trend of fashionable leather work boots. Punk rockers wore them in the 70-80s and now everyone rocks them! They are definitely fashion staples.  Then the Beatles probably started the shaggy haircuts with the clean look, I can't remember what those "boys" were called but there was a name for them.      Then I would say converse all-stars are staples in casual wear. They were made huge by NBA players (made FOR them actually).   These are staples, at least in a university-aged student's wardrobe.	episode_done:True

I hadn't read that New Yorker article by Rachel Syme before but I empathize with her tremendously. I've resolved that when I am vaccinated and this pandemic comes to a close, I'm going to dress to the nines every fucking day, and I've charged those close to me with holding me to it. I want to live intentionally, act intentionally, and dress intentionally. That is my path to self-actualize.

text:2020 in Hindsight: A Year in Fashion — Die, Workwear!	labels:I'll tell you this: moving forward, my comfort is first and foremost. Sure, suits will never go away but there had better be some seriously comfortable offerings from now own.
text:Tailoring is so often maligned as being uncomfortable by design, but I think the trends towards slim and skinny cuts over the last fifteen years are to blame -- to the point where many people have no idea how a suit is supposed to fit.  If jackets or formal trousers are too uncomfortable, the two most likely factors at fault are a) you are wearing an inappropriate fabric for the season and b) they are too tight. It's true that a suit is unlikely to ever feel as soft and flexible as a pair of joggers and a t-shirt, but for the most part there's no reason why it should be uncomfortable.  Some general tips: higher waists and wider thighs for trousers than what is currently trendy is much more comfortable - as is holding them up with braces rather than a belt, if that is a style you're happy with. Jackets should have wide enough shoulders and narrow enough armholes that they do not affect your movement at all; the fabric should just drape off you.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:FAQ: What is the difference between off the rack (OTR), made to measure (MTM) and Bespoke?	labels:**Off the Rack / Off the Peg / Ready to Wear**: You go to a store. You see a thing. You buy it. You can tailor it afterwards if you want to.  **Made to measure**: You have your measurements taken. Your measurements are sent somewhere. The thing you buy is made according to your measurements and specifications. Options may be limited, or... not-so-limited, depending on the company you work with.  **Bespoke**: You go to a tailor's shop. He measures you. He makes you a pattern, and then a suit, with his own hands, with his own shears. There are multiple fittings. He will do anything as long as he wants to do it -- you can ask for any fabric, any detail, and as long as it fits the house style and he doesn't think you're an idiot, you'll probably get it.  Edit: okay, so bespoke can be outsourced. The technical definition is that the pattern from which the suit is made. For made to measure, there's a standard pattern, and they adjust a number of measurements to fit you better. For bespoke, they make a pattern just for you from scratch. What this actually means for fit depends on a lot of specifics, including house style and how many measurements the MTM shop is willing to customize.  Generally, the difference between MTM and bespoke is complicated, and only stands out if you really know what you want and what the MTM shop can't do -- high-end MTM will usually fit very well and come with a lot of customization options and very hig hquality.	episode_done:True
text:FAQ: What is the difference between off the rack (OTR), made to measure (MTM) and Bespoke?	labels:/u/blackstrider has a great TL;DR but I'll add a bit more detail to MTM and Bespoke.  MTM: The pattern/style is generally pretty fixed, often there aren't fittings, and you make adjustments by changing standard measurements like "I want to add 0.5" to the leg opening". Pretty flexible format but I find it takes a couple of garments to really figure things out which can be tough.  Bespoke: Often a pattern is created for *you*, there are multiple fittings (in-person). This is where you can get really specialized tailoring looking at the pitch of you arms, how much you round your shoulders, etc. Bespoke tailors/cordwainers will also have styles that they specialize in so don't go to a tailor that specializes in structured "English drape" if you're looking for a casual unlined jacket or something.
text:I would make the analogy to a custom home.  There are your garden variety semi custom home builders that build large communities.

text:FAQ: What is the difference between off the rack (OTR), made to measure (MTM) and Bespoke?	labels:OTR - clothing is made according to an existing pattern for different sizes.

text:A Bespoke Shirtmaker On How A Shirt Should Fit	labels:Sleeves are my eternal issue with shirts, and why for so long I opted for short sleeve shirts. So often with RTW shirts the cuffs are so big they start sliding down my hand (looking at you, Charles Tyrwhitt). If they have a second button quite often it makes a dip in a bit rather than the complete circle and often still goes down my hand enough that the cuff bends when I move my hands. So many RTW shirts also have their sleeves a bit too short for me (kind of acceptable considering overly large cuffs). Some end up being too tight in the upper sleeve, painfully cutting into my arms if I reach forward (looking at you again, Charles Tyrwhitt) no matter the size. I don't remember shirts doing this in the past so perhaps an issue since I gained weight.	episode_done:True

text:Can you build a wardrobe off Amazon?	labels:NGL you can make some decent fits with amazon/target/walmart tier items - but they are not very good quality and not very good for the environment or workers.

text:Can you build a wardrobe off Amazon?	labels:I’d doubt that Amazon offers enough quality pieces to really redo your wardrobe.  If you’re 21 and not really making money yet I still wouldn’t look for the cheapest items and “biggest steals.”  I’d look to add pieces here and there as I go along that fit the weather/routines you’re currently experiencing.  I’m not advocating for buying overpriced pieces either, just simply stating that just because you may be able to buy a “complete wardrobe” off Amazon you may be very disappointed in your choices if your wardrobe is shot by the time you’re 23.  Good quality clothes can last forever, and the money you spend will stretch further.	episode_done:True

I think people want the look of well-fitted, tailored, bordering on skinny pants.  I think the majority of the (western) world sees these tighter fitting clothes as more attractive.  However, they're not the most comfortable in many cases.  They restrict movement.  Reddit's answer and even to a degree forward-ish fashion has been to get loose fitting things and create a vibe around that look.  Big silhouettes and wide lines.  It's super comfortable.  The middle ground is to get tighter fitting clothes that still move with you - you have the look of the skinny clothes with the freedom of the loose clothes.	episode_done:True
text:Whats with all the "stretchy mens pants" startups I am seeing all of a sudden?	labels:Have you ever worn a pair of Lulu's warpstreme pants? The hype is real.  Edit: Not sure why this is controversial. Lulu's men's pants have been hyper-successful for casual office attire, and other brands are trying to capitalize on it by making a lower-priced alternative. It's that simple.

text:Why It's Important to have a Style POV & Desired Aesthetic	labels:A well-thought out and reasoned article! I think I have some consolidating to do when it comes to my personal style POV. I tend to approach dressing from the perspective of artistic performance, and so I'm drawn to a lot of different aesthetics that don't mix-and-match as well. It depends on my mood. I am envious of your ability to have cohesion across all of the outfits in your article; no matter what style they may be, they all look like you!	episode_done:True

text:Why It's Important to have a Style POV & Desired Aesthetic	labels:I really agree with this post. As I've gotten more into fashion I really have begun focusing on intention of a fit. Using jeans as an example you can wear jncos to slp skinnies and all can "fit" depending on the aesthetic you are going for. deciding that aesthetic and discovering clothes that fit within it is the most fun part of fashion for me.   I think it's worth talking about how you do this when your POV/aesthetic isn't so cut and dry as vintage menswear or repro workwear as well. That's where I  struggle. It's easy to copy/mimic things but mixing influences to create your own style is a difficult process because of the trial and error required.
text:>  I think it's worth talking about how you do this when your POV/aesthetic isn't so cut and dry as vintage menswear or repro workwear.   Thats incredibly important. Obviously I'm writing from a place of personal bias, but I definitely think a similar mindset could be used for other styles, especially as most "common" ones have a root in classic/vintage menswear. For example, Engineered Garments and Evan Kinori have a similar basis, but done with a twist on details and silhouette.  I think its healthy to simply think about *why* a piece of clothing appeals to you and to have your own inspo albums saved for reference (and explanation, if people ask you why you did something). Trial and error is a big part of it and shouldn't be dissuaded from!  And even then I think that mimicing is an important part of style; copying would be if you wore the exact same things the same way as your inspo. The latter seldom happens due to budget or accessibility to certain brands.  For example, I've done SLP inspired looks, but instead of head-to-toe YSL, I could wear a 1950's biker jacket, reproduction rayon shirt, thrifted black levis, and RM Williams. It might be mimicing as a whole, but its still my own take on it with the pieces I already own.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Why It's Important to have a Style POV & Desired Aesthetic	labels:Figured I'd let you know that ten years after finishing undergrad and six years after finishing my masters, I still get those dreams about missing a final or realizing I'm enrolled in a class I never went to once every one-two months.

text:Why It's Important to have a Style POV & Desired Aesthetic	labels:I only skimmed this (I do enjoy reading your posts, just on a lunch break and today's a long day) but I can totally get so much of it. It's only been recently that I've really gotten what I want to look like, and it really is great to not feel tied down by what "works" in a traditional sense. Sometimes there are more meh days and such but the fun for me has been getting to the look that I want to see myself in, and it has really helped me feel more confident and not like I'm just wearing a costume. Though that isn't to say my days arent frequently pretty basic, but even then there's always a piece in an outfit that I wanted there to be, whether it's a specific shirt that I like the pattern, or how a specific bracelet goes with my colors.  Though I will add something, I do find it quite frustrating when someone asks me for advice. Not because I don't like helping people with clothes (I quite love it sometimes), but because a lot of these people don't know what they want to look like and while I *can* dress them it's not really *them*.
text:Thanks for perusing, haha! I'm glad that you're getting closer to your own POV and acting on it. That intentionality is really what makes it seem less like a costume *and* makes mistakes easier to swallow.    I totally get you on the basic days- even I have my lazy stuff, but it could be white socks + loafers or a bucket hat that makes it my outfit more interesting and special lol.  Oh dude, people asking for advice can be insufferable.

The Traveler Jogger is very comparible to Lululemon ABC Joggers, and the light weight version is essentially the Surge Jogger.  Still expensive at $79, but cheaper than Lulu and goes on sale.  I've picked mine up between $35-$45.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Dress shoes EEE trouble	labels:I mean, they look like sneakers with a loafer Halloween costume that they put together with stuff from their closet 5 minutes before leaving to trick or treat. In other words, they are sneakers pretending to look like dress shoes, and it shows. Generally speaking, elastic on a loafer like that is a marker of low quality... there’s very, very few attractive and high quality loafers that have it.  BUT, your health has to come first. The brand that would be most recommended here for good dress shoes that can accommodate wide feet is Allen Edmonds. But it’s understandable if they aren’t affordable for you. You might want to check out diabetic specialty shoes.

text:Dress shoes EEE trouble	labels:As some posters have mentioned, Allen Edmonds makes great dress shoes and have width sizes up to EEE (3E). They also make orthotic shoes or used to at least. I know price is a big factor for you, so I *highly* recommend checking eBay for a used pair of Allen Edmonds orthotics in 3E. As long as you don’t mind wearing used shoes. You can often find like new or barely used pairs. The orthotic models often go for under $50 used in my experience (I sell used dress shoes online).   I can help find you a pair. You can PM me or comment your normal shoe size and I can see if I can find a suitable, fashionable shoe for you on eBay.	episode_done:True

text:Dress shoes EEE trouble	labels:I can relate with you quite a lot because I too must wear eee shoes and have searched for brands that fit my desired style choices and budget. Alas, my recommendations are likely not to be too budget friendly; my favorite company is Alden and my second choice is Allen Edmonds. Both are made in America brands (with AE having some exceptions) and offer a great array of width options ranging from A to EEE.  I have worn AE for nearly three years now with my favorite last being the 201 and the 1757, both of which offer more generous toe boxes and insteps: However, my favorite shoe of all time is the Alden 405 (and the 403) because the last perfectly contours to my natural foot shape. This detail is essential because my right foot is slightly but noticeably wider than my left foot. Of course, none of these suggestions are cheap.   After I graduated from university three years ago I went to my local AE store and was properly fitted. I then searched on Ebay for a proper fit and found a decent pair of AE shoes in my size hoping to buy a new shoe later on to make sure the AE salesperson's great customer service did not go unthanked ( eventually I bought my Dalton boots from her). Then last year, I stumbled upon Shoe Mart's Alden Seconds program, reached out to their customer service team to figure out what my Alden Tru balance size. Soon after, I purchased the Alden 405 and instantly fell in love with it. The arch support is great, the ankle support is superb, and most importantly, the toe box fit like a rugged glove.  I hope my personal experience is of some help. Just keep in mind that buying used is not a bad thing if you put in the effort to properly clean and sterilize each purchase until you save enough to buy a new pair.	episode_done:True

text:MFA Brand MegaReview: Camoshita | January 23, 2021	labels:I love Camoshita and look forward to the new seasons every year. I've never handled a piece from the brand that wasn't perfectly executed and ultra comfortable. I don't wear a lot of suiting, but I've had some of their shirts and outerwear on heavy rotation for years.	episode_done:True
text:MFA Brand MegaReview: Camoshita | January 23, 2021	labels:I've owned (emphasis on owned) a couple of Camoshita pieces over the years and while I have good things to say about them, I will also add that the brand is practically laser focused in what I think it does (that is, casual contemporary #menswear). I hesitate to use casual because of its manifold definitions in clothing, but I'm talking about bold patterns and detailing, not pretending a chore coat is a suit jacket.  Anyway, the one suit I've had is excellent, though maybe only appropriate at weddings because of its general boldness. In detailing, it is almost identical to my normal United Arrows suit. The buttons are really nice, "lighter" than my american and european suit options with a nice iridescent glow. Is it mother of pearl? I don't know, but it's definitely flashy if you know where to look. The sportcoat I had was similarly detailed and it made me look like a used car salesman with its bold, brown check. This is a good thing, but I unfortunately rarely have call to look like a used car salesman so I moved it on. What made me give up on the brand were the shirts: twice I bought them on deep sale but found them far too trim, especially through the sleeves, and too fussy with the buttons. I can't exactly recall but I remember there being more than one place on both shirts that had more buttons than should be there. More than I care to put up with.  Anyway, the point is to say that if Camoshita fits your life, it's great. I love my suits and still wear them. The materials, work, and design details are, in my limited experience, unimpeachable. But of course, if what Camoshita does isn't what you want, the infinite steez of Kamoshita-san isn't suddenly going to rub off on you and make you the Prince of Pitti.	episode_done:True

text:MFA Brand MegaReview: Camoshita | January 23, 2021	labels:Camoshita is one of my favorite brands. Their offerings run the gamut from tailoring, to casual, and you can honestly build an entire wardrobe off of the single brand.

Kamoshita has an incredible eye, and it really shows in what his brand offers.	episode_done:True

text:MFA Brand MegaReview: Camoshita | January 23, 2021	labels:@danhakimi - you're correct about the spelling of the brand. Yasuto Kamoshita (YK) wanted his brand to have an international/European ring so he used C instead of K.   I think that's an important part of what Camoshita is about. From the very start, YK conceived the brand as something that he wanted to sell outside of Japan, outside of the United Arrows (UA) store network. In a sense, that's an experiment for UA and YK - they didn't have a brand to wholesale like that. Beams (UA’s arch rival) developed a couple of wholesale brands for the international market but UA never did.   So everything about designing and marketing Camoshita was done looking outside Japan : size ranges, showing at Pitti and NY, working on Western retail schedule... the other Japanese brand that we carry that has this approach is ts(s).  It’s worth noting that many of the styles that YK designs are drawn from his own clothes (bespoke and vintage finds). Also, credit is due to Hiro Tarao who develops most of the designs and styles in the collection, from YK’s direction.   My appreciation for Camoshita is very much because of his color palettes and the incredibly tasteful eye he has for fabrics and colors. Many are custom developed (fabric mulls don’t make those shades of ochre and mauve...) which invariably adds to the cost of the clothes (again, not dissimilar to ts(s))  Happy to answer any questions from my own perspective - having been around the brand and YK for a while now.

Then over the years I have gotten to work at just about every "type" of menswear shop. Big box retailers, flashy online-only outfits, bottom of the barrel makers, the extreme top of the top family owned shops.   I've been able to do everything within the business, too. I've sold, designed collections, marketed, ran operations, did the buying, taken out the trash, taped up and shipped orders. The whole thing.	episode_done:True
text:How to Make a Savile Row Suit: A Short Documentary from the Museum of Modern Art	labels:Happy to pop in here and answer any questions y'all might have about the Savile Row suit process.   Source: Currently work for a Savile Row Tailoring House
text:Mostly business info but I was wondering: How is your business doing?   Why does Savile Row as a collective not really work together on marketing and media?      Is there a big gap between a Tailor's management and workers?	labels:Saville Row is a street. How much marketing do you see for fifth avenue?	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 20, 2021	labels:I was recently awarded a 40 Under 40 award by a regional magazine. Part of the award includes a photoshoot to be printed in said magazine.   I'm a creative director for a living, I work in an environment that prides itself on comfortable dress. I have tailored suits, I know how to put together a nice outfit. However, I'd like to do something a bit different for this shoot. The suit is obvious, it's expected. How can I switch it up? Show off some more creativity in patterns, materials, or unexpected pieces.
text:I’d probably do   - unstructured sport coat with pattern or texture in something like dark burgundy or deeper green as an alternative to blue - shirt, pick what color you want - wool pants with some more texture or pattern, eg. a chalk stripe flannel or something. I think a medium gray would be the move here and would pair well with just about any jacket.  - tie and pocket square optional, I probably wouldn’t as it could come across as stuffy. Could do a square with no tie. - shoes id keep *slightly* more casual; maybe a chelsea boot or a penny loafer or something. You’re a creative director so show some creativity.  If you want some inspiration look at stuff like Drake’s, Boglioli, or Eleventy.  It would not hurt to bring two jackets, or if you decide to wear a tie, two ties, to the shoot in case one photographs drastically better.   Look a little creative but don’t add a bunch of accessories so it doesn’t look like you’re trying too hard.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 20, 2021	labels:Few questions regarding parkas  1. How long is too long? I'm a little below average at 5'8 in socks, a parka I'm looking at goes down to lower thigh, maybe a couple of inches above my knee.  2. How do you feel about fur trimmed hoods on parkas? Do you think it looks too bulky for someone who is not super tall? Also is creme colored fur feminine?  3. Should I even invest in a parka? I live in a pretty mild climate (Santa Cruz, CA) it'll get to low 50s and high 40s at night rn, someimes high 30s and very rarely below freezing every few years. I figured it would make sense to have a good winter jacket since sometimes my friends and I go to the Sierra Nevadas, but should I just layer up for warmth instead of investing in a parka?  Anyways that was a lot of questions, thank you	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 19, 2021	labels:Hi - working from home these days in New England, I'm looking for a recommendation for a pair of winter shoes (i.e., water resistant and warm) that I can slip on without using my hands for simple errands like taking out the trash, dropping the kids off at school, etc. I've tried a couple LL Bean options but each required to use my hands, which can be difficult when I'm also carrying trash, kids, etc. I typically don't wear socks at home, and so if there was an internal lining that's even better. Looking to spend under $150. Extra points if it reasonably goes with athleisure but not a requirement.  Thanks!

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 19, 2021	labels:I asked this in yesterday's chat, but I'm sharing again for visibility & hoping someone with experience with this issue:  Does anyone have a recommendation for a specific brand, material, or style of pants (including jeans, slacks, etc.) that are comfortable, stretchy/non-restricting, lightweight, and would fit a taller individual well? My husband usually wears linen shorts but would need to get some new, longer pants for a potential new job. He doesn't like the feel of most typical jeans and slacks and has trouble finding the right fit for his height. Any other guys with a similar issue? Maybe a suggestion for where to shop? Thanks in advance for your help!

text:Having a Tough Time Finding Retailers for My Style	labels:So, look, I don't want to tell you _not_ to do this, but if I've understood correctly you're looking at creating a bloodborne-inspired victorian/traditional wardrobe. There are elements of that style that have mainstream appeal today, high-waisted wool trousers being one example. However, when you take them in context with the more "interesting" elements you picked out it gives off serious cosplay vibes. Perhaps you should take the fact that the only places offering this sort of clothing are Etsy/cosplay stores as a hint that you should reconsider this idea.  You might be thinking, _what about the cyber goth vampire Rick Owens fits I see on this sub?_ It's a valid question. The key difference is that the style you're going for here has _such_ a strong association with cosplay and videogames and so little mainstream appeal that the number one association people are going to make is that you are cosplaying. Doubly-so if you're wearing cosplay-quality clothes from cosplay vendors. While the Rick Owens aesthetic may not have mainstream appeal it _is_ very accepted within fashion circles and _doesn't_ have that strong cosplay association.  So with that said my advice is to take what you've got and tone it down. Treat it like a high-fashion runway show and take inspiration from it instead of trying to recreate it 1:1. High-waisted trousers, great. Gaiters? Maybe just get some actual boots. Bloodborne-style woolen collars/scarves/hooded shawls? Wear a regular scarf that has an interesting shape or texture, or a shirt with a more exaggerated collar. Maybe the fact that you can't find retailers selling this kind of stuff is the limitation you need to make it work in the real world.  Or maybe I'm just talking complete shite and someone smarter than me can help you more. I hope that I've at least broken the ice and said what needed to be said so that people can try to constructively help you.

text:I appreciate your comment and understand what you're saying. Like I said in the post, I have tried many aesthetics and styles through out the years and I really do think I know what I'm talking about when it comes to dressing well. I have no need to prove anything to you but in my own social circles I've always been the stylish one and most of my friends come to me for advice or do the exact thing that I'm doing here, which is ask me where to go to find certain items.  I just don't really understand the fascination with people wanting to tell me that what I'm looking for is wrong, and forgive me if I'm misinterpreting this, and then I should stop and look for something more mainstream and appropriate? I mean to me, isn't that part of fashion? To step out of your boundaries and try new things?   If all your comment is is a warning that I may look like a cosplayer,  then I appreciate it. But funny enough, I am also a cosplayer and I think there is a fine line between items that will look like everyday clothes vs costume pieces and I'm doing my best to find those.  And either way, you won't know until you try it :)	labels:> If all your comment is is a warning that I may look like a cosplayer,  then I appreciate it.  That's all it is. There are plenty of people who try e.g. the Rick Owens aesthetic and fail to pull that off because they don't have a feel for what works and what doesn't. Confidence is also a huge deciding factor in whether you're pulling it off or not. I'm not saying it isn't possible, just that you really have to know what you're doing in order to be successful with it.  Like the other guy who replied to me said, if you have to ask you probably shouldn't.  > I just don't really understand the fascination with people wanting to tell me that what I'm looking for is wrong  We get _a lot_ of people coming through here and asking our opinions on wearing cosplay gear. Some items are asked about so frequently that they've become huge in-jokes in the community (BR2049 coat, Drive scorpion jacket, Bloodborne trench coats) so the first assumption people are going to make, particularly here, is that you're another one of those people. When someone comes here asking if they can pull off a Bloodborne-style coat the answer is almost always no. Not in the contexts in which you want to wear it, not in the outfits you intend to pair it with, not if the quality is terrible, not if you don't have the confidence to not care what the majority of people will think.  There's nothing wrong with doing this if you know what you're doing. If you're sure that what I'm saying doesn't apply to you then I really hope you find what you're looking for.   I genuinely look forward to any posts you make in WAYWT because I'd love to see someone successfully pull this off! If you have any inspiration images for complete outfits perhaps you could put an album together and post it here.
text:I would love to post pics once I find some stuff! I think maybe that's where it's getting muddled up: I don't think I asked if I could pull it off, I was just asking where to get them.	labels:You didn't ask, but people often skip considering whether they _should_ before they go full steam ahead and start spending money. Since this is an advice sub and the people asking questions are generally new to this and unsure of what they're doing, people here tend to err on the side of caution especially when it comes to more niche styles like this.	episode_done:True

text:I agree with you 100%. The sleeve thing, gaiters, and video game style collar things are a recipe for disaster. Maybe the aesthetic is possible to pull off, but it would require very high quality pieces and someone who is really good at this kind of thing. It's one of those, if you need to ask for advice, there is no way you could pull it off scenarios. As terrible as it is, I'd probably chuckle if I saw someone wearing any of those accessories at a bar or something. I'm just picturing someone alone at a dive drinking some shitty (or very oddly expensive for the bar) single malt whisky alone approaching random people and trying to talk about outdated philosophers. Even just the high rise pants look seems very intimidating to me. I'm always very impressed by the people on MFA who pull it off. It seems like one of those things where if you pull it off you look incredibly fashionable, but if you fuck it up just a little you end up looking  wholly ridiculous.	labels:And I won't know until I try it :) Have faith that I know what I'm doing

text:Having a Tough Time Finding Retailers for My Style	labels:This seems like the makings of a really bad decision to me. Way too much going on. Unless you want to look like a cosplayer all the time I would recommend wearing only one or two statement pieces at any given time.   Perhaps the reason you can’t find any store that sells the times your looking for is a good indication that the style as a whole does not exist to the extent that you might hope.

text:Having a Tough Time Finding Retailers for My Style	labels:You might want to check out some “artisanal avant-garde “ type designers. I tried to find a good album just now, but nothing really hit the mark exactly, but you might be able to put the pieces together. Try looking up some older Yohji Yamamoto (particularly for the high rise trousers), ann d, ma+, etc. Many pieces have this old-world but surreal feeling that you might like   Even if the prices are unobtainable, they may serve some guidance for your style that is (slightly) less video game vibed. Unfortunately, in my experience the line between cool aesthetic and cheap cosplay costume is often directly linked to the price
text:Thank you for the advice. These are items I'm definitely willing to pay for and I know what it will take to not have some of the accessory items look like silly costume pieces vs nice pieces. But finding those has proven difficult.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Having a Tough Time Finding Retailers for My Style	labels:For trousers/ pants I'd go with 2-pleat or ghurka trousers, both are high-waisted and look similar to what are featured in your general fashion board, actually I can see there are definitely Ghurka trousers in there. Same with Herringbone wool vests. Just by learning the names of the garments you'll have an easier time finding good brands.   The flecked suit you linked with the filson looking bag looks like Our Legacy's Midnight Sheep Jacket/Trousers from 2012. Good luck finding the exact thing, if you want to try grailed, Marrkt or ebay depending on where you live. Otherwise just include search times like "flecked" or "nep".  A lot of the clothing in the general fashion board looks to me like vintage workwear. I don't know what your budget is like but if you want to put a lot of money into it then brands like Belafonte, RRL and Pherrows might be quite good.   For the avant garde "Unique" stuff you have going on, try Rick Owens, Damir Doma, Julius, Number (N)ine, ann demeulemeester, and spend enough time in that circle and you'll figure out what you like

text:what are wardrobe items you own that you absolutely recommend to everyone else here?	labels:Some random ones off the top of my head:  - Lightweight popover shirt. I’ve got one in olive seersucker that I wear constantly in the summer. - A really good grey sweatshirt. Works as a mid layer in cold months or as the only thing over a pair of shorts in the summer and will be at home in a bunch of different styles. I like my Todd Snyder / champion one.  - Slim straight or straight dark wash or black jeans. As close to a “must own” piece of clothing as exists. - A good pair of boots. I like my RM Williams a lot at the moment, but something like a service boot or Chukka is equally useful. Great for all the situations “in between” sneakers and something more formal.  - Long coat like a duffle or balmacaan. Cool way to standout when it seems like every dude in existence has transitioned to patagonia or other down jackets for winter casual outerwear.

Worth every penny.  Ralph Lauren Slim fit OCBD - I find these the perfect balance between small collar uniqlo ones and old school baggy Brooks Brothers  Black bit loafers - the one dress shoe to go with if you don’t have to wear suits all the time.  Technically too casual for suits but it’s 2021 and no one cares, plus you can wear them with jeans with more casual outfits and get a whole lot more for your buck. I like Gucci but all brands make these at every budget.   One pair of black, and one pair of dark blue slim jeans  A nice wristwatch - I’m partial to a vintage Omega, vintage Rolex Datejust or a modern Panerai depending on your style that will go with everything and where you can mix and match different straps  Lululemon ABC Joggers - live in them when I don’t have to dress up, and they still don’t look sloppy  Uniqlo Merino sweaters - so cheap and does the job as a mid layer  Abercrombie sweatshirts - no logo options fit me great and are super cozy. I regret paying so much for John Elliot ones I have now  Suede biker or trucker jacket - that’s the one piece I go to when I want to look a bit “extra” and it always does the job  Denim shirt - go to casual piece to throw on a tshirt. I think Levi’s are cheap and fantastic   LBM blazers - great modern slim fit blazers with casual textures, fits perfect and you never look like you wore your suit jacket. Incredible value on sale for how much I wear them	episode_done:True

I rented from Avis and it was a bit expensive, about $450 (I purchased extra insurance).

In no way should it be legal to charge 14X the estimated price. The worst part is, no customer service agent was able to tell me why the charge increased, and the option for extra insurance just popped up at $35 a day.

Previously I have almost entirely shopped vintage/thrifted my wardrobe but it’s just gotten bloated and unfocused. That being said I don’t know a lot about clothing brands. Here’s what I’m looking for:  -Ideally US made, or at the very least ethically produced. I want to avoid exploitive fast-fashion. This was a big reason I previously only thrifted.   -Decent quality, I don’t have the money to buy super high-end but I am fine with paying a little more for something that will last.   -specifically looking for some solid color cardigans and button-ups, a sweater or hoodie or two, black chinos and black jeans, and some decent priced white tees. I found that I almost always wear black pants + white shirt + black/navy/olive/beige top. I’m pretty happy with that formula right now, just looking on ways to riff on it endlessly.   -Previously I have liked Everlane and Los Angeles Apparel, if that’s any kind of frame of reference.

I've recently purchased a sewing machine to do my own alterations, and the results are promising, however, I need to practice and I need shirts for that. I'm going to e-thrift them, but since I can't be there in person, I want to know where I should aim at. I know that Eton and everything else in that price bracket is good, but I'm talking about more common brands, easier to source. Charles Thyrwitt, Olymp, Boss, Lagerfeld, Joop!, Eterna, Seidensticker etc. Would be the ones to look for here (Germany based).  Can anyone give me some experience please?	episode_done:True

text:But dont throw the clothes away. Donate them	labels:Yeah, I found one of those donations bins and just threw everything in it (excluding some of the more well used clothes...).

text:I sell my old clothes all the time. If you are good at only buying decent brands that don't depreciate too much in value, you can often make back 50-80% of what you paid.

Reported it to the DoL but I don't expect them to do anything about it.

The first rule of the forum is you are not allowed to ask how these things were sourced.     Lastly the embroidery studio i work at was contacted for a large order of Rhodesian flag patches. I contacted the client to see if it was for a film or something and he was very cagey about their purpose, so I cancelled the order and refunded his deposit, which lead to me getting chewed out by my boss, who is apparently fine with making White Nationalist memorabilia if it's obscure enough to not get him in any trouble.

text:That’s whack. Out of curiosity, how do you know this was a sweatshop vs a legit workspace?	labels:super crowded, poor ventilation, a staff consisting entirely of south asian women, not enough masks to go around, really, really cold inside, and when I walked in the foreman/manager was extremely hostile about making me leave. Even in the unlikely event that everyone working there had a visa and was being paid the (frankly criminal on it's own) NYC Garment worker minimum wage of 12-and-some-change an hour, the conditions were not at all safe (for covid or just generally).  "Sweatshop" doesn't really have a strict definition but if you saw this place you would certainly feel bad about your clothes being made there. It's kind of an open secret that these places exist in NY and LA but coming face to face with one was kind of a shock.	episode_done:True

text:MFA Brand MegaReview: Drake's | January 16, 2021	labels:I have a handful ties from Drake's: one is Easyday, one is MTM, and the others are mainline.  I don't deny that other makers are better made, especially since Drake's ties are getting much more expensive than when I first saw the brand in 2014.  However, I think that mainly applies if you're buying solids or repps. I like buying their more abstract designs or "soft squares", as most other geometric ties out there simply don't have the same vibe (unless you're buying vintage).  The same could be said about their tapestry motif scarves, of which I also one own.  There's also their sleeveless cardigans which I really like. The wide rib on the "V", chunky buttons, and shorter length appeal to me, because again, not many other knitwear companies do it that way. Maybe if rubato made sweater vests.   I also own one Drake's shirt, which is a bold awning-esque multistripe. It seems okay, as like with the ties, I bought it for the pattern rather than the quality. It was acquired during a sale, so it was only $120~ compared to the 200+ it retailed for. In fact, all my Drake's items were bought on sale!	episode_done:True

More conservative items like navy blazers are paired with non-traditional items like camo pants (high level move). And even when something might get a little office-like, a detail like tucking the tie into a waistband does enough to subvert the expectation.  It's all about details. A denim shirt under a jacket here, an unexpected pop of colour there. Something that makes you look a little closer to find out why it's not all so corporate.	episode_done:True

text:Tailoring for the People	labels:Favorite ways to incorporate tailored clothing casually (easiest to hardest, IMO):  All of the tailored items should be on the casual side (OCBDs, patterned shirts, non-worsted jacket/trousers, textured and/or patterned fabrics, etc)   1. Swap in button up shirts for tees and/or layer under sweaters/sweatshirts, non tailored jacket, overshirt, etc.  2. Swap in trousers for chinos or denim. Knit, sweatshirt, tee, polo, hoody, etc for the top. 3. Button up shirt and trouser. Layer with knit, sweatshirt, non tailored jacket, overshirt, even a hoody. 4. Jacket with denim. Non button up shirt top (knit, sweatshirt, polo, clean solid tee) 5. 4 but with a button up shirt 6. Jacket and odd trouser (odd meaning it's not a suit). Non button up shirt top. 7. Jacket, button up shirt, odd trouser. 8. Suit and non button up shirt top. Could be tied with 7 if the suit is casual enough.	episode_done:True

Good thread on the SLP teddy, but just about nothing in there is surprising. Is it well-constructed? Duh, it's SLP. Does it have little refinements all over, compared to everyday varsity jackets? Yeah, that's kind of the point. Is it "worth" $2,000? No, obviously not.   Like...at some point we need to acknowledge that these efforts are misguided, even if well-intentioned. You're buying SLP because it's SLP (or Ackermann, or Dick Ovens, or whatever your thing is). *That* is the justification. And that's a fine justification in and of itself! An analysis of the materials and construction is unlikely to throw up surprises that'll make people go "damn, that really makes it worth the obnoxious price tag!"

text:I feel one of the issues is that in this subreddit we have:  1.  A group of people who genuinely want to know why people make large purchases (people just getting into fashion, hearing about spending more to get better quality leather/materials). I was in this group for a while.  2. A group of people who are looking for the absolute cheapest way to get into fashion, they often take pride in getting things for cheap and some even get a sense of superiority for getting the same look without spending as much as "suckers" who buy designer fashion.  3. Hobbyists who have the money to spend on exact items they want.   I genuinely think that one of the issues that causes people to butt heads in this subreddit is when the hobbyists feel they need to justify their purchases when confronted with the question "why?"  Getting the exact item they have searched for is a valid enough reason, and trying to invent other reason to "justify" a purchase often causes confusion for people who are trying to get involved in fashion and are genuinely asking "why is this item worth it?" When I first was looking for new footwear, the number of times I was told that $500 boots were worth it because how long they would last was absurd.	labels:>when the hobbyists feel they need to justify their purchases when confronted with the question "why".

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 15, 2021	labels:A question about cotton/modal blend undershirts:  I used to buy the **Hanes** Comfort Fit Ultra Soft Cotton/Modal undershirts, and they were OK.  A little while ago, I picked up a few **Goodfellow** brand cotton/modal/spandex blend undershirts from Target on a whim, and they were much better than the ones from Hanes. Softer feel, but still thick enough to wear around the house, and longer than the Hanes shirts so they stay tucked in better. My only complaint was that the V-neck wasn't very deep, so it would often show when I left the top button of my shirt unbuttoned. I can't really wear them with casual and camp collar shirts.  Recently I haven't been able to find the Goodfellow modal-blend undershirts at Target (only 100% cotton), but I'm reluctant to go back to the Hanes ones now that I've tasted this luxury.  I've looked at the **David Archy** modal undershirts, because I have some of their boxer briefs and find them very comfortable, but they are a 92% Modal, 8% Spandex blend and the reviews suggest they leave nothing to the imagination.  I'm also looking the **Uniqlo** "Dry" V-neck short-sleeve shirts. However I already have two Uniqlo "Airism" undershirts, and they are so thin they are nearly sheer. I don't really feel comfortable wearing them without another layer.  Are there any other cotton/modal (or similar) blend shirts that you'd recommend? My personal preferences are:  * Ideally less than $10 each * Soft and moisture-wicking fabric, not 100% cotton * V-neck deep enough to leave one button open without the undershirt being visible * Not too thin and revealing  Thanks!	episode_done:True

text:Light Down Jacket Inspiration Album	labels:For me personally, I really like light down jackets.  I know a lot of guides have solidified around the usual classics: harrington, denim, biker, and bomber jackets  but I find myself wearing my light down jacket more often.  They are super light. they fit well and have that same short cut like the others that looks cool. I don't have to worry about piling or shaping as much. they can be very warm too.    and more importantly I find them easier to layer under another coat, while the others fit a bit weirdly.  So light down jackets in fall and spring. then in winter, put them under a wind/water proof coat.  also pairs well with a sweater or fleece vest.	episode_done:True

text:Does AGE really effect your choice of Fashion - Clothing Trends (Discussion)	labels:Honestly, I can tell you are still young (mid-20s) from the nature of the question. It depends on lifestyle much more than age. Plenty of 40 and even 50-somethings wear trendy non-conservative clothing especially in creative or tech industries, while plenty of 20-somethings dress like dads because they have more corporate jobs. But as you get older, you do shift brands a bit. For example, currently, 20-somethings might still desire streetwear brands like Supreme, Vetements, and Yeezys while those older might still be hip but shifted to Fear of God, Balenciaga, CDG or more upscale brands that still have a casual street vibe.

text:Does AGE really effect your choice of Fashion - Clothing Trends (Discussion)	labels:I think age matters less than what matches you and how confident you are in your clothes.    I'm 38, soon to be 39 and it's extremely likely that you (at 25) dress far more conservatively than I do.
text:Ah right ok, interesting, thanks for that!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Does AGE really effect your choice of Fashion - Clothing Trends (Discussion)	labels:I’m 40, so here is an old’s perspective on this. I do think that certain super-trendy looks which work on a 25-year-old can look silly on an older guy, particularly if he seems uncomfortable. But at least he’s trying! What’s far more common is older guys whose shopping habits don’t change at all between age 25 and 45, and they’re still wearing band t-shirts to most social functions and showing up to weddings in a suit they bought in 2005 when they were 30 pounds lighter. Here, age is negatively impacting their look, not because they’re trying to look too young, but because they’re stuck in the past.  From a younger guy’s perspective, when I was 25 I remember feeling frustrated that my social circle wore nothing but hoodies everywhere, and my lifestyle didn’t really afford me many opportunities to dress up. While I totally agree that dressing well doesn’t mean dressing up, I’ve always liked to dress up. And I was a little annoyed that I couldn’t wear a blazer out to a dive bar without someone making a joke about my yacht club membership. This is an area where as I got older, my lifestyle changed so that I had a lot more opportunities to wear tailoring and other more “adult” clothes, both at work and in my social life. At least until COVID. My 25-year-old self would have enjoyed wearing a lot of the stuff in my 2021 closet (maybe with some tweaks to the fit!), but he would have had nowhere to actually wear it.	episode_done:True
text:Does AGE really effect your choice of Fashion - Clothing Trends (Discussion)	labels:It's totally dependent on the environment you live/work. 5 years ago I was dripping in "minimal streetwear" but now I wear suits every single day. Shit, I still have a closet full of Common Projects, W+H, etc. but I feel weird wearing that stuff even on my days off.	episode_done:True
text:Does AGE really effect your choice of Fashion - Clothing Trends (Discussion)	labels:My perspective is from someone who got interested in wearing sport coats, ties, and “professional” clothing at 17. I just turned 24 and only now do I feel like I have a solid grasp of fundamentals to try new stuff after 8 years of taking clothing seriously.   To me, it all depends on what you want to communicate to others. If you’re only dressing for yourself, you can wear whatever. If you’re more conscious about what others will think too, then there’s an element of “dressing your age” for societal acceptance.   The reason why people shit on 50 year olds wearing hollister is because it’s so apparent that they’re trying so hard to recapture their youth rather than accepting their age and what positives come with it. In the same vein, 17-year-old me wearing ties and sport coats was me trying to shed my youth and move too quickly into professional adulthood. Both have to do with fighting against what we’ve been given rather than working with what we’ve got in a natural way.   The issue may be one of standing out from the crowd being frowned upon, but I think it has more to do with the underlying mentality and reasons why people chose that look.	episode_done:True
text:Does AGE really effect your choice of Fashion - Clothing Trends (Discussion)	labels:Age plays far less of a role than lifestyle.   If "fashion" is done right for the common man it's lockstep with lifestyle providing functionality and a look that's still flattering, interesting and portrays an image the wearer wishes to project.   That's age indiscriminate really.	episode_done:True
text:Does AGE really effect your choice of Fashion - Clothing Trends (Discussion)	labels:I am more into raw denim/Japanese workwear than I am into streetwear or other genres. But what I see in that world is that age has little to do with it. Cohesiveness and fit really rule supreme. In fact, some of the best looks I see pulled off in the raw denim space are among dudes 50+.	episode_done:True

text:Does AGE really effect your choice of Fashion - Clothing Trends (Discussion)	labels:I'm from Japan and a male in those age categories, would likely dress quite differently.  Japan is a land of 'Uniforms'. many spend much of their grade school to high school in a uniform.  when they go out and get a job.. they gotta wear a 'uniform'.. either a suit and tie, or some company uniform.  College is usually the time for experimentation, but because people have such a strong hard-on for fads and trends, they end up being in a uniform again.  maybe in 2017-18 ish. the trend for college age men was a wool chester coat and a hoodie underneath (a mix of very casual and slightly formal).  fast forward 2-3 years later, it nearly completely fell out in favor of oversized fleece jackets, or North Face Nuptse and other similar puffers.. usually in black and yellow.  guys 30s to 40s stop dressing like that  guys 40s and up tend to focus more on brands to flex their income and status, but often wear ill fitting stuff.. as well as strange color stuff (likely went to a Ralph Lauren outlet and could only afford that bright yellow shirt that was on sale because no one would buy it)  People often judge you by what you wear as they think it reflects your occupation or status. For example some one wearing shiny black with a lot of accessories is perceived to be involved in the night industries and probably of lower education or culture.
text:Thanks for your reply. I see what you mean. Here in the UK people in Primary/Secondary school wear Uniforms, and most workplaces, but in College and University they wear anything, back in college and University a few years ago people usually wore jeans and hoodies etc. Sometimes I feel people wear things to reflect the event they are at (e.g. college or a party) instead of how old they are.  And I notice a lot of celebs wear things to make they Unique, and really stand out. Like a bright white hoodie and white trousers. I guess it's probably whilst they perform and they change afterwards? But its interesting as people within their age group wouldn't always wear the style they do.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Your favourite men's style shopping "hacks"	labels:If you like the look of vintage clothing, workwear, brands like RRL etc there is really no need to buy from the expensive reproduction brands or the curated vintage fashion stores or IG pages.   There is absolutely loads of that kind of thing for cheap on eBay (probably where those curated vintage stores get most of it from...) and even well regarded brands like Filson, Woolrich, Schott leather etc tons of that available. All it takes is some extra work on your part to actually sift through it, find whats in good condition, worth buying etc and get to grips with the 'keywords' of the clothing items if that makes sense... ('hunting jacket', 'rancher coat', 'A2 flight jacket', 'type 1 trucker' for example) and can also be good searching by fabric type... ('vintage corduroy', 'vintage suede jacket', 'herringbone wool' and so on), these are a good way to narrow down your search.  Some downsides obviously though like not always having proper recourse on things like returns etc like brands and stores will give. But if you put the time in searching, there can be a lot of good bargains to be had and you can get the look of those reproduction brands on a budget.  Not just vintage either though. Especially on things like jeans, if you have already zeroed in on a specific model with favourite fit you know you like, ebay also has a shit load of people selling Levi's, Lee, Carhartt etc brand new old stock, whether they couldnt return a purchase, offloaded from stores closing down, end of season, whatever. Again though, obviously takes searching on your part to see what is genuine and worth buying, but I have managed to get a couple pairs of selvedge Levis and Carhartt jacket way below RRP, as cheap as I would pay from some crappy high street store.	episode_done:True
text:Your favourite men's style shopping "hacks"	labels:This is probably opposite of most of the advice here, but I advocate for buying *exactly* what you want and not worrying about sales/price etc (assuming it fits your budget). I'd rather a few garments I love than many that are ok/fine.  Edit: NB that this is with the caveat that you have a good understanding of what you like and what works for you. If you're new to the idea of dressing well or with intention, it may be worth holding off on springing for things.
text:Agree 100%. I've bought alternatives to the actual item I've wanted and have always been disappointed. If I just put that money towards the original piece, it would have been much better.  I don't mind spending on clothing that I actually like/want.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Your favourite men's style shopping "hacks"	labels:Go through your wardrobe minimum once a year. It helps me to have a 4 tier system.  A - Cothes I like, wear, and fit me well. I have worn them recently and would wear them recently again. These are my go to.  B - Clothes I like but might not fit perfectly but still wear. These are out of rotation but just don't get worn as often. Could also be sort of like a specific situation sweater, these I would hate to lose.  C - clothes I want to sit on to give another chance. If I don't end up wearing it in a season/year/whatever period it will get donated  D - For donate/sell. Don't wear or don't fit. No use in taking up space for something I don't like or may have not held up so well. If you can get money back great but I also say have a time limit. You don't want to hold onto it because it doesn't sell.  I also kind of have a category for gifts/memorable occasion clothing. And that just helps me know, hey I am visiting a friend who got me a shirt let me wear the thing they got me. Might not be my style but I do try to hold onto these for a least a little while.	episode_done:True

text:Your favourite men's style shopping "hacks"	labels:My “hack” follows in line with yours.  I always recommend people look into blanks (I like rue porter), because as you grow up you start find yourself gravitating towards more subtle clothes rather than a big Nike check on the chest.     Additionally, I recommend looking for timeless pieces if you’re starting off a closet. Buy things that have stood the test of time, and will look good on anyone regardless of age.  For example: - a denim jacket - a leather jacket - black jeans - a well fitting white shirt   Lastly, a “hack” I have is telling my friends to follow people that have the same body type as them. Some things look great on on body type but you buy it and you won’t understand why ya look like a saran wrap California roll.	episode_done:True
text:Your favourite men's style shopping "hacks"	labels:I use Airtable to maintain my "closet" spreadsheet and "wishlist" spreadsheet. At some point I'll write a blog post and share the templates. I used to do it on google sheets, but Airtable is much nicer.  These spreadsheets help me be intentional about what will actually add to my wardrobe. Do I really need another solid color t-shirt? Having items sit in the wishlist also helps me make sure I don't want it on a whim. I did not really, truly want an Autodromo watch. Time with an idea as well as a system really helps regulate behavior.	episode_done:True

text:Why Did Bottega Veneta Delete Its Social Media Accounts?	labels:I suspect this is a marketing ploy of some description - and it has certainly worked as I have seen this covered in multiple venues. It does start/re-start the conversation about the use and value of social media for brands.   As the owner of a small brand, our results over the last few years have been mixed. We haven’t committed a lot of resources to the various social channels but I’ve found they take up a disproportionate amount of time with frequently unmeasurable results. It’s easy to see these channels as ‘free marketing’ but they are anything but. It’s good to see bigger brands look more carefully at their returns here as the costs of doing things on social media has gone up considerably. And don’t start me on ‘influencers’!
text:Thank you for bringing this small business perspective to it. I only really follow small businesses on my IG. I tried to follow my favorite brands (Acne, YSL, Casablanca, etc) and I had to unfollow. They're just a mess and I never engaged with the posts. Jacquemes is the only brand that has a decent IG and it's basically just his personal account with some shots of their office.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Why Did Bottega Veneta Delete Its Social Media Accounts?	labels:All these thinkpieces serve to do is mystify a transparent marketing strategy dovetailing neatly with the ethos of the brand. As a brand Bottega Veneta is fashion's equivalent of your friends on social media who announce to the world that they're going to be moving in silence from now on  – a brand for those who want to be lowkey, *but not really*.  Social media makes sense for brands like LV for whom the core ethos is in your face flaunting, as Instagram is both chief flex medium and ultimate marketing tool to an aspirational public. Bottega Veneta's courtship is a bit different. If I'm BV I don't even want to be seen as attempting to court that customer, and so the retreat from social media makes sense considering the brand's appeal to aspirational customers who want to be perceived as more sophisticated than those of LV. In reality BV is every bit as accessible before (just type it into the search bar) but it's the *illusion* of withdrawal which is key, both in attracting more aspirational customers and retaining your seasonal clients, for whom discretion – especially in LVMH's major growth market of China – is key.  I don't have any experience in marketing or the luxury sector but what this tells me is that LVMH believes either that a social media presence was a waste of resources or that this'll help cultivate a fake sense of "in the know" among their growth demographic, particularly with COVID exposing the full extent of income inequality's social rot.  Considering influencer fraud, flexing, and the danger of being mixed in with the bland minimal luxury aesthetic running rampant on IG, it makes perfect sense for them to pull back.  &#x200B;  TL;DR: It's just good marketing. The brand will still be very present in all the relevant outlets that actually generate sales.
text:Bottega Veneta is owned by Kering but yeah the same thing still applies to them too.  I noticed that right after Phoebe Philo left Celine and that brand changed the whole look with Hedi Slimane, there was influencers on social media etc calling BV the 'new Celine' and hyping the brand, it was getting pushed on places like GQ and other mags too. Maybe that was an organic shift and the Phoebe Philo Celine fans just wanted a new brand to love after she left but also, it could easily be inside marketing from BV and Kering to take advantage of that space. And I remember Celine never used to have an Instagram page, social media or much of an online presence at all that kept it kind of mysterious, now BV is trying that. More than a coincidence?	labels:Bottega being positioned as the 'new celine' had a lot to do with Daniel Lee taking over at BV who had previously worked under Phoebe at Celine. It was definitely deliberate positioning but the appointment of Daniel Lee meant it had some credibility to it rather being just purely buzzwords.	episode_done:True

I can’t (or haven’t yet at least) worn them outside because I’m too concerned about what other people think and self-conscious (which is ridiculous in the grand scheme of things). I think part of the draw for me is how unbelievably effortless and confident some of these fits are. The impossibly laid back styling that Japanese magazines like popeye, cluel and fudge for some reason really interests me. To me these fits aren’t all exactly what I’d like to replicate, but I think they give me some useful tips in dressing down some coats and jackets which can often come across as too formal.	episode_done:True

Where did you get those shoe racks?	labels:Awesome choice, haha I'd get a pair myself if I didn't have these 993s.   I got the shoe racks from Amazon! Look up "Seville Classics shoe rack" and that should get you some hits.	episode_done:True

text:Totally valid. I think starting with the 574s helped the idea of 993s and 992s grow on me, but I could see how a different sneaker or more formal shoes (ie. loafers/bluchers) would've worked better for these outfits.	labels:Props to you ma man! great vid regardless	episode_done:True
text:Unboxing and Styling New Balance 992s	labels:Those are some ugly shoes imo
text:I wouldn't say they are ugly, but they aren't my favorite, either.  I've found the 998 straddles the line perfectly between looks, uniqueness, and funkiness.	labels:oooh some of the Made in UK 998s have definitely caught my eye before... haha I might be tempted if I keep looking at them
text:When I bought my 998s, I had probably ordered 4 or 5 different other models to try to find the perfect balance.  I've owned 574s for years (and still have a pair I wear regularly), but wanted something a bit more unique.  Bottom line, I'm not cool enough to pull off the more "dadlike" New Balances, which it seems modern style is trending towards.  The 998s were as close as I can get.  For the dadlike ones, you've got to have your entire fit absolutely on point.  If anything else is slacking, the shoes look unintentionally bad and not good at all.	labels:	episode_done:True

I avoided them for years, remembering the preppy kids from high school with huge logos all over and reaking of abercrombie cologne.

The company has made a big pivot since I was in highschool 15 years ago.	episode_done:True

Then you just pick the stitches by cutting them with the seam ripper and pull out the strands by hand or with a tweezer.	episode_done:True

text:Sweatshirt: I'm shocked by my purchasing decision from yesterday and needed to share	labels:A&F is still reeling from some of the negative feedback of its CEO and 2000's image and branding  which is too bad because A&F has for the last 3 or 5 years, made some significant changes to their image. I think when on sale (and they have a ton of sales, for example 50% everything during the off xmas season, 40% off black friday), they offer a very good price to quality ratio.  I highly recommend them for their henleys and button down shirts, especially the oxfords. they can be found with out logo too.	episode_done:True

text:> on the flip side, why do bowls of pho or hand-pulled noodles cost severely less?  Same reason why, in popular culture, food from France, Italy, etc. continue to be considered atop the hierarchy of global food while food from India, China, Thailand, African countries, etc. are not.   Not that that's the only reason, but it is one of them.  >why does a plate of carbonara cost $20 in LA and NY?  You'll also have to consider that restaurant pricing in places like LA and NYC will just be higher on average, in addition to the dumb prestige-premium associated with ordering "French food" and "Italian food."	labels:	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - January 12, 2021	labels:does anyone think that for some reason men are obsessed with the technical details of a fit than women are? I usually don't generalize things around gender like this but with this I have found it to be hilariously common and wondered if other people have found it similar.  It's all anecdotal but my dude friends IRL or the reddit/sf dudes all seem to care deeply about sizing of an item, how certain things should be (e.g. where pants should stack, how to cuff pants, where jacket sleeve should fall compared to your hand, I could go on) and take the longest time comparing pit to pit, sleeve, rise dimensions between different sizes and items before pulling the trigger.  On the other hand, from my limited dealings with women who are interested in fashion, I've hardly ever seen them asking for measurements from sites and these technical details don't seem to be high up in their list of priorities when they're deciding to purchase or deciding on their fit.
text:In the past I've typed up multiple comments about this exact thing, but deleted them all for fear of weird misogyny vibes cause I don't exactly excel in expressing myself in English.        All I'm gonna say is that I think it def is a thing, although mainly on the Internet and even then not *that* big of a thing and that I think it's because fashion is EXPECTED from women so there are far more women not intensely invested in it but who still participate because of social pressure, where as men are expected to NOT be interested in fashion, so the people very invested in it who are interested in things like details and cuts self-select to be the majority of male fashion people due to the not-so-interesteds dropping out due to social pressure.	labels:FWIW, I've written and deleted a response to this three times, and English is my only language, so don't feel bad about that.  You actually articulated what I wanted to say better. I was going to say that due to societal pressure on both men and women, there's *way* more women that would rate their interest in fashion in the 2 to 8 range on a 0-10 scale. There's probably more women that would want to be a 0 or 1, but feel pressure to make more of an effort than they would choose to without those pressures. And there's more men that would be in the 2-8 range that are 0s and 1s because it's not considered manly to be into fashion. So the few of us that decide to say fuck it end up going all in at a 9 or 10. So that's how you get a ton of dudes concerned about the length of the collar points on an OCBD, and a ton of women that don't care about the inseam length on their capris.	episode_done:True

I used to have Vans and they looked great, especially with jeans and cuffed pants but after getting Adidas boost I couldn't go back to Vans...Boost is just way too comfortable, been rocking them for 3+ years. However I like the look of Vans + pants so I've been shopping around recently. I tried a few pairs of Vans today but their comfort can't compare with Boost.  Are there any shoe brands that have the Vans style but is way more comfortable? There might even be comfier Vans models that I didn't try. Any recommendations are greatly appreciated!

text:Better With Age: 10 Things Better Bought Used – Put This On	labels:Can confirm that Brian at Wooden Sleepers is an encyclopedia on vintage. If there's some specific vintage item you've been looking for, definitely send him an email and he'll probably come up with something.  I agree with most things on this list except for vintage knitwear; maybe I just haven't seen a good example, but old sweaters are scratchy + don't really look good beat up + hold smells deeper than things made of cotton. Especially with the premium on nice vintage these days, I'd rather get something new.  Vintage OG fatigues and vintage chamois shirts are incredible though. Both fabrics are so much more comfy when worn-in, and you get to continue telling a story by wearing them doing work / making art / going on hikes / etc.	episode_done:True
text:Better With Age: 10 Things Better Bought Used – Put This On	labels:Hey all, I'm one of the guys Derek mentioned in the article.   I'd say fully half of my closet is used, if not more.  I used to thrift a lot when I was younger but as I've gotten older, I've decided that I'd rather than spend my time, I'll spend money at Grailed, eBay, and consignment stores.  Regarding the latter, San Francisco has two that are well-curated: Goodbyes and Sui Generis.  Just passing this on in case there are any SF Reddit users.	episode_done:True
text:Better With Age: 10 Things Better Bought Used – Put This On	labels:My vintage 80s Levi's denim sherpa is probably my favorite piece in my closet and was only like 40 USD on grailed.  Its nice knowing that it's made in the USA, better quality than new, perfectly faded and comfy for a fraction of the price of new.  Regardless, I feel that we're getting to the point where you're paying the same or more for vintage as compared to new due to the rise of vintage clothing stores and old pieces being trendy. Unless you get lucky at a goodwill or thrift store, but I find most of the stuff I find at actual thrift stores are pretty boring or not even all that old (lots of fast fashion crap at thrift stores now).	episode_done:True

Nothing too flashy, but the Woolrich collection goes so hard. Also have to say, as much as I love some of Howlin' designs,  compared to the ALDxWoolrich stuff,  Howlin' quality is just not there.

text:General Discussion - January 11, 2021	labels:2020 was probably the worst year of my life (most of the year was ok but nov/december was so awful it dragged it all the way down), but a serious silver lining was that i lost close to 35 lbs. i've been overweight pretty much all my life but not what most people would consider obese. still, it has always affected my self-esteem and confidence, and i was at my peak weight at the start of 2020, 235 lbs.  I cannot overstate how taxing it was to not see the scale budge downward for so long and always seemingly ticking up. a suit I had bought a year prior to fit comfortably after I gained weight was starting to not fit, real "ah shit here we go again" moment. at the start of the pandemic though, i lost 14 lbs in like two months and was ecstatic. i ticked another 10 or so lbs downward before I plateaued and you know, I was happy about it because I never felt hungry and I had a consistent lifestyle and it was good that I could live like that and not gain or lose weight at all. Then, I came down with food poisoning in december and barely ate for like a week and lost another 10 lbs (hardly healthy but in 2020 i'll take the good with the bad). Even after getting better and feeling good again I have kept that weight off and now weigh under 200 lbs for the first time in years. I'm ecstatic for more progress in 2021 and hopefully finally being confident enough to buy the dope clothes I want and not worrying that I look bad in them.  It's so interesting what relativity does to you. I'm 198 lbs rn, but I was last that weight when I was a senior heading off to college and felt awful about it. Now, I feel fucking great and way more confident than I was before. Funny things. The mission is 170 lbs but I'll be happy to be between that and 180. Sorry for the paragraphs but I know this forum more than almost anywhere will understand struggles like this, especially for guys.

Now, I feel fucking great and way more confident than I was before. Funny things.   I've been losing weight for the last year; weight I've carried with me for far too long now.  When I have started to plateau (normally because I'm eating too many calories or not exercising enough), I weigh myself and tell myself that I will either be really happy or really sad to see myself at my present weight again, and it's my choice to decide which it will be.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - January 10, 2021	labels:Out of curiosity what setups are you guys using to take and edit your fit pics? Phone in a mug? Professional camera? What focal length is your lens, are you using a tripod? Anything interesting you'd like to share?  I have a 23mm lens on a Fuji X-Pro1 (APS-C, so I believe 35mm equivalent) that I usually mount on a tripod with a 10sec timer & 6-frame burst-shot. It's time consuming to set up and get a good picture because the preview is tiny and there's no e.g. WiFi sharing so my alternative setup is a phone mount for the same tripod. Recently discovered I can get a live preview from my phone on my laptop so I've been using that to browse the pictures and check I've framed everything correctly etc.  I use the lightroom mobile app to crop and edit the photos. Basically every photo is cropped because I have to stand quite far back from the camera to get everything in without distortion.

text:For many people on this sub fashion is a hobby, and so they don't mind spending a bit more on quality items. Some materials (e.g. wool/ leather) are just more expensive.  There's also the question of quality. A 500€ leather jacket may be usable for 20 years, while a 100€ one will deteriorate after 2.   The reality is though, people on this sub rarely pay full price for their items. Many buy during store discounts or second hand. Buying second hand is a great way to get quality clothing for little money! Find some brands that you like and then go look for them used.  Many people (me definitely included) are working with a small budget, it's definitely possible!	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Guidance organizing a suit for my fiancé for his father's funeral during lockdown	labels:In this case, you're not going to be able to find an exact match for the jacket fabric to turn it into a suit, so we're looking at a somber odd jacket w/trousers look.  To keep things somber, a dark, muted, monochrome palette would be my choice. I'd recommend a white shirt, dark matte grey tie with minimal pattern (could be a grey Glen check if you can find that).   For trousers, I'd avoid navy since it doesn't work that well as an odd trouser colour. Go with a pair of grey trousers a shade or two distinctly darker or lighter. Try a pair of charcoal or mid-grey wool flannel trousers, and pair that with black shoes. He'll get a ton of use out of those trousers in the future since they'll go with almost any kind of jacket as a blank slate. The jacket should be ok — any shininess will contrast with the flannel trousers, but that's actually what you're looking for with an odd jacket/trouser combo.   I applaud you for thinking and planning in advance for him; you seem like a great fiancée.

text:Guidance organizing a suit for my fiancé for his father's funeral during lockdown	labels:So one thing to keep in mind is that, when your father passes away, most people aren't paying attention to what you wear. Many communities don't even expect a suit -- they just expect you not to wear anything too loud or disrespectful. But assuming he still wants a tailored jacket and pants.  6'5" is rather tall. I tend to say that height is not a clothing measurement, and it's not -- he might still find something off the rack... buuuuut it may be a lot of effort, especially if you can't get an arm measurement without a lot of effort. And I suppose it's not worthwhile to have him measured for a Made to Measure suit. So sure, just keep the gray jacket you have.  A gray jacket is... kind of easy and hard to pair at the same time. On one hand, it's neutral. On the other hand, you don't want to pair charcoal with black because it's usually low contrast; you don't want to pair it with other darkish grays, and you can't pair it with light grays for a funeral. You can't pair it with bright colors for a funeral. So you need navy blue trousers. That's the conservative, classic choice here... and it's fine.  100% wool is fine. Don't worry about an obvious mismatch -- you *want* an obvious mismatch, you don't want anybody to think he was trying to wear a suit but couldn't figure out how to match properly, you want people to look at him and know he is wearing separates on purpose.  A white shirt is your safest bet. A light blue shirt should usually also work, but might be a little more interesting than you want for a funeral. Get something sized by neck + arm measurements. Try Charles Tyrwhitt, they have a good variety of fits and do easy returns abroad. Charles Tyrwhitt shirts are 3/$100, don't pay a penny more.  A tie is probably still not necessary for a funeral, but if you want one anyway... well, what's your budget? There are brands that will sell you great extra-long ties.  Oh, and use a lint roller or garment brush to clean that jacket.	episode_done:True

I have researched this shoe and even watch certain reviews for it that I conclude that I want to buy it.  However in my case getting this variant of this shoe and to my proper size has been quite a challenge for me. It's availability is quite rare in my Country (SEA) and all the shoes that I have found are either fake knockoffs and well soldout ads for other shoe websites.  Recently within my dedication to get this shoe, I thought of just buying the "Basic" Variant of the Cortez, and dissapointment follows as I picked the wrong size for my shoe (in my haste to buy the shoe) I measured my foot and it is exactly 26cm and and alongside with the confusion for the knowledge of the older shoe that I bought which is US 12 and EU 44 "World Balance Freeman" it confused me and well....... I bought a Large Shoe 😂 (specifically I bought the size 12 Basic Cortez). Although I placed an exchange size for an US 11, I might be in a pickle since it will still be big for me lol.  Now anyways to finally ask my question, If by somehow the exchange US 11 were still too big for me, Can I wear a WOMANS "Nike Cortez Leather" instead???? For that I will also need advice for the sizing and basically an expert knowledge in this situation. In my case all that is available for this shoe are for Womans Shoe, and within my research I read that Nike Shoes are Unisexual (but for now I need an Experts Advice on this matter) really in a pickle, so pls help ma dudes.	episode_done:True

text:1 Year - A Kmn6784 2020 Wardrobe Album	labels:I love this. I am currently working on overhauling my entire wardrobe because of two reasons:  1) I outgrew almost every single shirt and sweater that I own because I started going to the gym 2 years ago and I don't fit a medium top anymore.  2) I used to only shop at sort of street style or skate style shops and that is just not the kind of look that I want anymore (plus those clothes don't fit anymore anyways)  Your wardrobe looks so great! I feel like you've got everything for any occasion, and I agree that it looks like you can just shop for whatever you **want**, rather than what you **need**.  I really like the Greats shoes that you've got. I never heard of that brand but I was actually looking for shoes just like those. I have a pair of vans and a pair of blundstone chelsea's, but I really wanted something in between; something that says: "I am here casually, but I care about what I'm wearing". I may get myself a pair of Greats!  Also, I noticed a lot of stuff from J. Crew. I have bought from them once, a Kashmir sweater, and it was actually kind of itchy so I almost never wear it. Should I give them another chance? It seems like it's one of your go-to places.
text:Greats are fantastic, They're a bulkier silhouette than Common Projects but no one would look at them and think "chunky".   J Crew started as one of my favorites because of their absurd sales and inoffensive basics, I don't have any issues with the quality of the items and like all my pieces from there. One specific item to highlight though, their linen shirts are crazy good for the price, easily my favorite cheap linen.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:The Park Ave's? Those were $38 from TheRealReal, no wear on the soles so I'm assuming they were unworn. An absurd steal. Unfortunately I still have no idea which color they are, it might be a discontinued one.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 06, 2021	labels:Slippers for wide, sweaty feet?  I've been rocking a set of Glerups scuffs around the house for two years, and especially heavily since March. My wife has been non-stop complaining about tiny bits of felt that wear away from the inside, ending up all over the house... and now I've worn a small hole through near my pinky toe on my wider foot, so it's time to give them up. I'm tempted to just get another pair and deal with my wife's complaints about errant felt bits, but despite their excellent moisture management, I'm still a bit sweaty in them after a while. So, I'm on the hunt for a new pair.  I live in Florida so it's rarely ever cold indoors, the tile flooring notwithstanding. And I have very wide feet (9EEE/EEEE.) I like scuffs because I can just step into them without using my hands, but I'm open to alternatives. I've always wanted to be able to rock leather mocs, but going by even my comfiest leather shoes, I'll get far too sweaty, far too quickly, unless I'm wearing good socks... which defeats the purpose.  Any suggestions? I was thinking a set of boiled wool instead of wool felt might work better. I do have some boiled wool Haflinger slippers and I like them overall, though their construction leaves much to be desired for the price - the badly-designed seams are barely holding together, the glue is starting to separate, and the PVA footbed is prone to both sweating and stinking.	episode_done:True

text:> "why do some fits get praised when they clearly go against the sidebar"  I think this one could be enlightening to a lot of the people who don't understand how avant garde (or even just mildly experimental) inspo posts get so much praise by breaking traditional style conventions. It might help some bridge the knowledge base gap (i.e. you have to know the rules before you can break them) and help explain the (perceived) cognitive dissonance of traditional tailoring *and* designer fashion both being acceptable styles. I think that would help make it seem less jarring to those new readers who get confused when they come to this sub expecting to find answers for "how do I dress so that I look good," but they find a lot more of "how do I dress to express myself?"  For the record I think the second question is a lot more interesting and certainly the reason I'm here, and there's plenty of resources here that answer the first question (*if only people would look for them*), but I do value that this sub does an excellent job of tackling both. More discussion might be beneficial to newcomers to the world of intentional dressing, is all I'm saying, and the ones who are asking questions in-good-faith I think deserve to understand the rationale behind why someone might choose to wear Kapital instead of a suit.  One last edit: Not that I'm saying anyone owes anyone else any explanation for why they dress the way they do, but I think it's always interesting to learn the context.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Best White T-Shirts for Men 2021 - Wirecutter	labels:I am currently wearing a Lady White Co white t shirt, I love the fit and material.. but I dyed it brown lmao.  These are great t shirts, except something about them is just impossible to keep white. Maybe they havent been bleached as much ,or for some reason the fibers absorb more color, but it has been a real pain since day one. I don't really understand it  After the first wash left these weird extra white blotchy patches, which only showed up in direct sunlight. After many washes, these seemed to have gone away, though I'm not sure if the overall color has changed.  These shirts are constantly getting discolored by the wash (admittedly high in iron), and picks up all sorts of residue from the drying rack, or normal wear. Compared to every other white garment I've had, they are just super finicky. Like, its not ever been an issue with my other shirts, but these are always finding new stains to show off. One might say that I'm more critical of a $50 shirt than a $10 one, but I feel like this is an objective observation.  Ultimately, I'm much happier having dyed them to other colors. I prefer clothes which look better with age, so I tend to avoid white generally, but these are extra frustrating given the price and the hype. It dosnt matter to me how great the construction or fit is if they are a pain to keep clean.  The article says they are "offwhite", maybe this has changed? I feel like mine were very white to begin with.  It makes me wonder if something is different about the bleach or dyeing method compared to other brands	episode_done:True

text:Best White T-Shirts for Men 2021 - Wirecutter	labels:I’m a fan of the J Crew tees they rank highly. My favorite tee is the one they mention but in crimson. It’s a good fit, not too loose & not too slim. I’ve had it a few years now and even after many washes the color has held fast, although I don’t think it’s necessarily bad for some fading. It’s a v-neck that is not cut too low, which I like b/c it doesn’t show a tuff of my chest hair like some other brands do.	episode_done:True

text:[Inspo & Commentary] Rings	labels:A quick note about colored gold: you state that it is a different alloy composition which gives rose gold its pink hue, which is true. But there is no alloy composition for gold which gives it a truly white color. It is a Rhodium electroplating that gives white gold its brilliant platinum-like (as Rhodium is a platinum-group metal) whiteness, and white gold jewelry will absolutely require periodic re-dipping in Rhodium to maintain that color. Exactly how frequent is up to your body chemistry and wear pattern.	episode_done:True

Small and purposely subtle rings, bracelets and necklaces. Most items are between 100-200 dollars.   www.alicemadethis.com - Precision jewelery. Very minimalistic but precise lines and polishes. Can be as subtle as Miansai but have various sizes to make items stand out more in terms of size. Items are expensive with most being 200-400 dollars.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:[Inspiration] Sculptural Jewelry	labels:FAQ:  * "Why did you make this album?" I saw u/mcqueenofthehill's jewelry album yesterday and decided to share mine. His is practical wearable everyday jewelry, mine is all over the top extravagant absurd cocktail jewelry.  * "Are you stealing this format from /u/cdot5 and u/mcqueenofthehill?" Yes.  * "Why is this on a sub for men's fashion advice?" This album is inspiration, not advice. I'm not suggesting anyone wear this if they don't want to. This stuff isn't for everyday wear or even traditional men's cocktail attire. But if your style is out there you can make it work on occasion. I plan to get a couple of these eventually (if the artists ever reply to me).  * "It looks ridiculous/like a costume. No one will take you seriously." The necklaces in particular are **really** out there. But I wouldn't wear any of this to work or anywhere I need to be taken seriously. But if I'm going to a party or a play and I want to dress up, something like these pieces would be fun.   * "But this is women's clothing!" Yes. I wear womenswear. I combine it with menswear. You don't have to if you don't want to.  * "This may be cool on the runway, but nobody would leave the house like this!" I would.  * "Who makes these?" Orr, Cheryl Eve Acosta, Sara Barbanti, Wendy Yue, Leyla Abdollahi are the ones who have functioning web stores and/or stockists.   * "Is this a comprehensive compilation?" No. But this kind of stuff is really hard to find.

text:British shoes can be sleek but your not wrong American and some Brittish maker's lasts and welts are chunkier that being said this difference is so marginal I wouldn't worry about it with most of today's suits. Generally a boxier/looser suit would go with a boxy/Chunky dress shoe, but even that rule can be broken pretty easily with soft slouchy Italian tailoring.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Agree with /u/MFA_Nay in terms of fit, no matter how nice it is, it wont be as good as if it actually fits you well.  If that peacoat is like my WW2-era (tan corduroy inside the pockets, 8 buttons, huge collar, *very* slim fit in chest), the thickness and density of the wool is like nothing else under $800 retail.

text:If money were no object? Bespoke or haute couture?	labels:In this hypothetical I'd go with haute couture. In your friend's situation I'd keep looking until I found a designer I liked. Bespoke would be my last option for a couple of reasons. Your friend wants contemporary fashion, but most bespoke tailors make traditional clothes for a typically older crowd (you're in NYC though so there are some bespoke tailors catering to a younger crowd; make sure you look for them specifically). The bespoke tailors catering to a younger crowd don't have designs as good as high end ready to wear IMO. Tailoring and designing are different skills, and there's a reason Louis Vuittion, YSL, Dior, Gucci, etc pay their head designers millions per year. Of course some $4000 coats are worth more than others, so it would be good to know a bit about general quality.  Personally, I prioritize design over fit. I can deal with a less than perfect fit if I love the design of a piece. But I won't wear a piece if I don't love the design, even if it fits well.   The middle ground option is made to measure, or MTM. MTM for outerwear isn't as common for suiting, but it's out there.

text:These are all valid points and I appreciate your perspective on this. I totally value the integrity of top designers of HC labels as well. There are some incredible designs from YSL and Gucci that I would splurge on, even if the fit wasn't 100% what I wanted it to be.  The reality is though, that there are several body structures and only 1 final product, which doesn't capture all of those body builds, and that's the struggle with HC.  I genuinely think it's only a matter of time before traditional bespoke tailors move into goods that are more commonplace - t-shirts, sweaters, etc. - and most of these designers are quite good at their respective crafts.  I've interviewed many of these emerging designers/tailors myself, specifically Mike Paul, who is based in Toronto. He is moving into bespoke tailoring across multiple verticals. His story is pretty cool too. If anyone wants to hear it, DM me and I'll throw the link to the pod episode.  There's also another designer in Toronto that does bespoke jeans.  So, there are definitely designers who have identified the need in the market.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:If money were no object? Bespoke or haute couture?	labels:In this hypothetical I'd go with haute couture. In your friend's situation I'd keep looking until I found a designer I liked. Bespoke would be my last option for a couple of reasons. Your friend wants contemporary fashion, but most bespoke tailors make traditional clothes for a typically older crowd (you're in NYC though so there are some bespoke tailors catering to a younger crowd; make sure you look for them specifically). The bespoke tailors catering to a younger crowd don't have designs as good as high end ready to wear IMO. Tailoring and designing are different skills, and there's a reason Louis Vuittion, YSL, Dior, Gucci, etc pay their head designers millions per year. Of course some $4000 coats are worth more than others, so it would be good to know a bit about general quality.  Personally, I prioritize design over fit. I can deal with a less than perfect fit if I love the design of a piece. But I won't wear a piece if I don't love the design, even if it fits well.   The middle ground option is made to measure, or MTM. MTM for outerwear isn't as common for suiting, but it's out there.
text:Well, but bespoke tailors can do anything. They all have a house style, and maybe the Haute Couture brands do something a given house won't replicate, but unless theres' something really unique happening, you'll probably be able to find *some* house that can make you at least as happy. Probably.  The real issue with Bespoke is just the amount of time it takes.	labels:In theory, but I suspect that the number of bespoke tailors who are 1) willing to do fashion-forward contemporary designs, 2) able to understand the 'source code' and styling of those designs well enough to capture the details of what makes a particular piece special, and 3) able to procure the exact materials needed to do so is likely vanishingly small in practice.  I've seen examples on fashion fora of people asking bespoke tailors -- even talented ones -- to replicate designer stuff, and the results are usually a poor approximation.	episode_done:True
text:If money were no object? Bespoke or haute couture?	labels:I think /u/Ghoticptox pretty much summed it up perfectly, nothing to really add. I personally have no interest in bespoke because I value design more than minuscule fit details, I think this sub has a tendency to overemphasize how important fit actually is, especially considering how nebulous of a concept “good fit” even is.  Like, the fit “issues” you highlighted,   >shoulder tiny bit broad in one coat, a little extra material in the waist of another.  Are complete non issues to me, that’s just variance in fit and design, I wouldn’t blink at that on a piece I otherwise really love.  The more important thing to me, and I can’t believe no one else has mentioned this yet, your friend got into clothing a couple months ago, he doesn’t even know what he likes, it sounds like, and I mean this judgement free, he’s just going around looking for the most expensive thing he can find, I don’t think we’d recommend anyone go and buy a $4000 coat right as they’re getting into fashion. Like, is he rich enough that he can afford to make that work or rich enough that it literally doesn’t matter? Because I think unless $4000 is something you can spend in a day and not blink itms probably not a good idea to go and drop $4000 and a true bespoke coat when he could end up getting into streetwear in 3 months and never wear it again. At least in that case something like YSL will retain value better and can be sold for more, as opposed to a lot of traditional tailoring brands, which go for pennies on the dollar on the used market	episode_done:True

Probably.  The real issue with Bespoke is just the amount of time it takes.	labels:I think I see what you mean. Bespoke tailors are great pattern-makers so they can theoretically copy anything. So if you show them a YSL/SLP or Dior coat, they should be able to make it for you. Some won't do that on principle. Some won't even copy a garment you own that's damaged or too small. It's also impossible for it to look the same because it'll be a different pattern. If what you want is an exact copy of something, you're better off buying the thing and tailoring it	episode_done:True
text:If money were no object? Bespoke or haute couture?	labels:Split the difference. Some top houses have a very discreet bespoke line that blends bespoke fit with the adventure of couture, only for those in the know. Hermes *sur mesure* and Berluti in particular. There are also particularly progressive bespoke tailors that push the envelope in design, materials and construction at the top end: Davide Taub at Gieves and Hawkes; Michael Browne; Cifonelli.	episode_done:True
text:If money were no object? Bespoke or haute couture?	labels:He could by a ready made coat and take it to a tailor and have it altered to  fit him better.    I don't see why a good tailor can't make something that looks as good as a Dior or YSL RTW coat.  Would you say a Savile Row coat would look like something from J Crew?	episode_done:True
text:If money were no object? Bespoke or haute couture?	labels:Here's a different point of view... I'd take a serious look at two categories beyond the bespoke / haute couture options.  First, my preference is for the Italian tailoring houses. Kiton, Zegna, Loro Piana, and Etro Milano etc.  First, they are more male / menswear oriented. And their materials and tailoring are exceptional and can be altered or mtm if needed. I have a Loro Piana Icer in cashmere that's beyond mere mortals. Of course, $4,000 won't get you very far - - but the quality is a level beyond the French design houses.   Second, depending on his design taste (and if I was younger) I'd consider the younger brands like CP Co, Rick Owens, Acne Studios, etc to see if they are more in tune with my desired look.	episode_done:True

text:I started doing around the beginning of the pandemic. There are several vintage/thrift shops near me, and for like two years they were my go-to for outerwear and the occasional shirts and pants. But it's so easy to start picking things up just because they're cheaper, and not be happy with them just a couple months down the line...  I've got maybe three or four real gems that I still wear from vintage hunting, but everything else has been donated or sold. I'm much happier with my wardrobe now, especially since I started to invest in nicer stuff. I'm wishing you all the best through that transition!	labels:I have gotten a ton of cool shit from thrifting but it really is so easy to grab something for grabbing something’s sake. Especially going to the cheaper places in NYC like L train. Soon you’re taking back like 2 or 3 pieces a visit, that shit adds up quick.    Thank you!!!
text:Definitely. For me, I went to some of the shops enough that I'd chat with the owners when I stopped in. For sure I value the idea of supporting local businesses + building relationships with people who are hustling hard, but it also made it much harder to leave without picking something up haha	labels:Oh that’s what I do 100%.

As someone who recently into jewelry and did a lot of research, silver tone doesn't work with everyone.

text:[Inspiration] Jewelry	labels:Cool stuff. Looking at this got me wondering.  Every outfit there is definitely on the casual side. I’m always curious to see how it would look with business casual and business formal wear, without being over the top.  Working on Wall Street, the only jewelry I’ve seen are cuff links, watches, rings, and occasionally wrist beads or bracelets. There was one stylish black man who would wear diamond studs with suits but that’s about it.  Curious if anyone has examples of subtle jewelry with suits and business casual outfits.
text:During the height of #menswear people were copying many of the Italians and wearing multiple beaded and/or leather bracelets which are a bit more lowkey since they don’t shine like metal. A single signet ring on the pinky probably wouldn’t draw that much attention given the old-school tradition of it. And if you’ll allow me to plug myself a little bit, some of my waywt posts have me wearing some rings and bracelets even with my tailoring, though it may not be super visible. Metal jewellery primarily has the intent of being seen though, so you will be making a statement by combining it with tailoring.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:[Inspiration] Jewelry	labels:I've been thinking about jewelry for a while. I got a nose ring and like it, a simple chain would be nice and a bracelet. Any recommendations for these from anyone??  I don't dress edgy enough to wear a lot of the rings/other jewelry in this inspo album

While I may not own an exact copy of the garment I'm considering buying, I probably own a piece that fulfills the same purpose already (with regards to utility or aesthetics), and if the comparison is too close with the new item then I know I should wait a week and see if I still feel the same attraction to it.

I’m 15, slightly overweight and have a 2-3 inch belly that I hate. 6’0 is my height. Atm I’m trying to lose weight, but I don’t have enough self confidence to wear anything but a baggy sweatshirt and jeans to anywhere.  I’m looking for some ‘transition’ clothes, so I can start trying to find my style without ‘showing off’ my fat, if that makes sense. I’m not really sure how to explain this lol.  Are there any brands that are good w/ baggy clothes, if not what are some inspo sources that have sweatshirts, baggy clothes, etc.  I’m in the US, and have a budget of around $100, maybe $150. I’d have what you call a ‘Baby Face’, very uncooperative hair (which is always in a side part, just naturally), and zero self confidence lol.   TL;DR - overweight, hate it, have no self confidence and want to start finding my style without showing off fat. Need suggestions on styles w/ baggy sweatshirts, t shirts, or styles that are okay at hiding fat while I lose weight.  Mods, if this isn’t allowed here please let me know where to post it!

text:General Discussion - January 02, 2021	labels:I'm proud to say that I was successful completing my new year's resolution from 2020 of not purchasing any new clothing. I had made the exception of new socks and underwear, but I purchased a bunch at the end of 2019 and they managed to last me for the year.   I chose the goal initially to try and cut down on my waste. I'm a very impulsive person who makes very impulsive purchases and a lot of what I was buying was going practically untouched. I had also seen the patriot act episode regarding fast fashion and that was the final nail in the coffin. The beginning was the hardest—especially once the spring/summer sales started. I found that after a couple of days I'd forget about the sale and eventually I stopped even looking at clothes online and hunting for sales.  The effects from the resolution carried over to other aspects of my life. I found I was more conscientious of other products I was buying. I spent time researching environmental effects and labour practices of all sorts of different companies. I have been a lot more mindful of where my money is being spent. I cancelled my amazon prime subscription and have opted to shop locally as much as possible, but if not, spending my money at small independent online retailers.   At Christmas I did purchased my dad a new Reigning Champ sweater from NRML, an independent store in Ottawa. I made this exception  because it sets up my 2021 resolution—the only new clothes I can buy are slow made, or made in Canada/USA. I think this embodies the spirit of my 2020 resolution but doesn't restrict me from supporting smaller designers.

That being said, I don’t think anyone here agrees that it’s infallible. In casual dress there are inherently no rules, rather things that might be better than something else.

text:You’re really the only person who can answer that question, JW Anderson, as most designers are, is not a brand you’re buying for the quality, but because you like the design. I haven’t handled anything from them but made in China does not equal bad and $225 is about what you’d be paying for nice knitwear from a quality focused brand anyway	labels:	episode_done:True

The range of styles and silhouettes presented here serves as a great reminder of the truly amazing variety we see in this community.   So c’mon, have a scroll through the album! Maybe not all the fits are your cup of tea, but they don’t have to be! Before you type out “why would someone even wear that,” just think maybe they like the way they look. Seeing as this is a collection of the users’ favorite fits from the year, I’d wager they really like the way they look. And, at the end of the day, if you feel good, you look good.   See y’all in 2021.

I remember WAWYT threads and the front page being super active, now I see posts with barely any comments and posts from 3 days ago on the front page.  This used to be *the* subreddit to be on with over 2 million subs. Maybe it was because I was most active from like 2012-2016 where hashtag menswear with clark desert boots and americana was huge, and a cultural shift of men wanting to learn how to dress better was occurring. Stuff like the MFA uniform coming out, comments of how people outside of California or NY were labeled as gay because they wanted to dress better lol.   Now it seems as if most men want to look good and dress better. And there are more resources besides this subreddit to help people dress better? It's less of a niche and now a societal norm? Or maybe it's just because it's 9 am where I live and people are still waking up lol.  What are your thoughts? Am I out of touch? Am I just too early? I've seen /r/malefashion is a lot more active.

text:General Discussion - December 30, 2020	labels:I dunno if this is dumb or not but having a real pair of good winter pants has changed how I approach fashion in the winter a bit.  I got those uniqlo wind-proof lined pants back in oct and they've been amazing, last week I wore them in -25 for about a half hour and my legs stayed cozy. The real benefit though is now when I buy new pants I don't have to worry as much about whether or not I can wear them in the winter. If I'm spending more than like 5 minutes outside I'll take off whatever I'm wearing and put the warm pants on, it's great.

text:General Discussion - December 30, 2020	labels:hey all. it's been at least 3+ years since I've looked at this subreddit. Lost my old account, but remembered this place exists. What happened? I remember WAWYT threads and the front page being super active, now I see posts with barely any comments and posts from 3 days ago on the front page.  This used to be *the* subreddit to be on with over 2 million subs. Maybe it was because I was most active from like 2012-2016 where hashtag menswear with clark desert boots and americana was huge, and a cultural shift of men wanting to learn how to dress better was occurring. Stuff like the MFA uniform coming out, comments of how people outside of California or NY were labeled as gay because they wanted to dress better lol.   Now it seems as if most men want to look good and dress better. And there are more resources besides this subreddit to help people dress better? It's less of a niche and now a societal norm? Or maybe it's just because it's 9 am where I live and people are still waking up lol.  What are your thoughts? Am I out of touch? Am I just too early? I've seen /r/malefashion is a lot more active.
text:I've noticed a drop in new users over the pandemic. Nobody really needs advice right now on what to wear to a wedding, or for date night, or job interviews, or their first office job. Another drop the last week due to the holidays but overall the core community is still pretty active across GD, WAYWT, and some recent discussion posts.  As for old threads on the front page, I'm guessing that's because a lot of the discussion has been pushed to recurring mega threads like Simple Questions. There was an experiment earlier this year with allowing simple questions to be posted as self posts and it led to stuff only staying on the front page a few hours but overall quality of discussions and recommendations was a lot lower.	labels:GD, expectedly, has risen significantly in average activity I think (though not that many total unique users).	episode_done:True

Their 625 fill power is lower than other premium brands such as Marmot or Mackage, which both have 800+. And while they don't state their fill weight, I'm guessing it's pretty low as well considering how light their jackets are.  I just bought the Chateau, and compared to my Marmot which is both heavier and has a 800 goose down fill power, the CG is somehow significantly warmer in -5 to -15 temps.	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 30, 2020	labels:I’m invited to a New Years indoor house party. This might seem simple and stupid for most, but I’m at a loss as to what I should wear.    I usually dress business casual, and I stand a lot. The pants I have aren’t very comfortable for rolling around in, or sitting casually (raw denim, tucked in shirt, etc) - to which at this party there will be food and drink, and lots of floor space to sit or lay (they have no furniture, and people usually just sit on the floor). Pretty casual, however I don’t want to look like a slob or over dress.   I know this is probably obvious as to why anyone would care if the environment is this chilled, but there’s a standard im trying to keep myself to.   Any suggestions - thanks.

text:Good quality men's jeans?	labels:Just wanted to reply that I'm a raw denim guy, but a lot of people are going to throw out raw denim recommendations to you.  One thing to be wary of.  Raw denim is unforgiving, so in the slimmer cuts I have found them **MORE** likely to have crotch blowouts than other jeans.    I've never had issues with crotch blowouts in your standard levis/gap/j. crew brands.  My first 2 pairs of raw denim had crotch blowouts, because I wore slim fits, and the point of tension is in the crotch.  My 21.5 oz and 16 oz raws had holes forming within 6 months.  I've since bought a pair of Samurai's in a straight cut and they seem as if they will last forever, but they are NOT slim.

text:Good quality men's jeans?	labels:> * The crotch tearing (this one's a reoccurring theme) * The dye running onto white shoes (probably the cheapest pair I've had has done this) * The jeans losing their shape/fit and turning loose  1. This happens when your thighs rub together and there's not enough fabric slack there. You may want to try sizing up at the thigh. Also, get a few pairs and rotate so that each pair only sees a third or a quarter of the wears instead of one pair getting it all.  2. This is called crocking, where indigo flakes off/falls off when abraded against something else. That's part of indigo, whether you're talking about jeans, jean jackets, etc. You can help remove excess dye with a wash and try a magic eraser on your shoes.  3. That's normal. The warp/weft weave will stretch out like a sweater after each wear, becoming noticeable in time. Wash them when they get too out of shape.
text:Your #1 tip is helpful, but my concern with sizing up is that I don't have a particularly large waist. My butt/thigh to waist ratio is a bit off in that I have naturally big thighs/a big butt compared to my waist. So if I simply sized up I would be quite loose at the waist. My jeans have already been a bit loose as is :(   As another redditor commented, I may have to look into the cut itself as to simply sizing up.   As for #2 and #3, thank you for clarifying. I've learned a lot in this post!	labels:Maybe experiment with types of fits, not just size. For example, Levi’s has the 541 athletic fit, Naked & Famous has the “Weird Guy”.

text:Good quality men's jeans?	labels:I've had one pair of jeans tear in the crotch in my entire adult life (it was a silly pair of Burberrys I had been gifted). I always wonder what people do that they get crotch tears so often. Rarely washing jeans also seems kind of meme-ified? They're just clothing; wash when necessary!   As someone who also favors slim-skinny jeans, chinos, etc., Rag & Bone is my absolute favorite "everyday" denim. The denim comes, or at least used to come, in different weights with a nice amount of stretch. Good range of colors as well. Fit 1 verges on being too skinny, but Fit 2 is perfect. R&B is always a bit overpriced at retail, but pretty easy to find on sale.   Saint Laurent during Slimane's tenure put out the sleekest, cleanest jeans and I love the pairs I have from that time, but I have no idea what the current offerings are like.

text:Reigning Champ Hoodie: 2 months later	labels:OP, I think your experience is an outlier and not representative of the brand. I've owned 10+ items from RC over the past few years.  I only ever had one incident with a pair of sweatpants that developed a rip in the pocket in the first few weeks of wear. I sent RC an email explaining the situation, and they happily sent me a replacement pair and a prepaid label to have the defective pair shipped back. It's entirely possible the rip was my fault and I didn't notice (could've easily snagged it on something), but they took care of me.  I would try contacting them and see if they can do anything for you. At 2 months, it may be pushing it, but if you make an effort to articulate your situation, you might get a replacement. Mention that you took the advice of online fashion forums when you made your purchase and that you were surprised by the poor durability and that you think you may have gotten a defective item. It's always worth a shot!	episode_done:True

The tees get most wears and has some pills (mostly because I put them in dryer) but the collar is still in perfect shape.  I'd say you most likely beat it too hard or snag it somewhere. I've never got a hole in any hoodie (cheap or expensive) in my life.	episode_done:True
text:Reigning Champ Hoodie: 2 months later	labels:Often times, cheaper, more utilitarian fabrics are more durable. While I can't speak to RC's quality as I have never owned any of their stuff, terry-cloth is generally a softer material and can be more likely to abrade. So if you are like me and place a lot of weight on your elbows while seated at a chair with armrests (esp if you have pointy elbows), then you might find that you develop holes there and so you either change up how you sit or you realize that you need something that will work with your use-case (denser weave material or maybe reinforced elbows/elbow patches). Not dissimilar to how some people put holes in socks more easily than others. Shape of your body and how you do normal, everyday things can impact how things wear on you.    More expensive does not mean more durable. These are not the same thing and it's something that people really need to stop using as a reason to spend more on something. Durability \*can\* be a high-quality product's claim to fame, but is certainly not generalized to everything.    Durability is also not a measure of quality. It can be part of why you consider something to be "quality", but that's up to you what you want from your garments. Unfortunately, you don't know what you don't know, and going by what people recommend means that you're basing your purchasing decisions on other people's preferences. Fashion can be an expensive hobby and there is a lot of trial and error as you learn about yourself and about the various things that go into making a garment.	episode_done:True

text:How to Talk About Collared Shirts	labels:Brilliant guide, must have taken a lot of work to put it together so thanks for all the effort you've gone to.  Would it be worth a mention on sloped shoulders?  I went through loads of brands and fits (even custom) because every shirt I wore would fit well in most areas, but I would always be left with big diagonal creases from my collarbone.  It was only the last custom company I found, asked me if I had sloped shoulders.  Turns out they are quite severely sloped which was the cause of all my issues.  Nice to see wool mentioned as a material, its not very common but is brilliant for shirts.  My mum found a Ralph lauren Polo shirt on sale in a department store about 7 years ago, it was reduced to £15 so she just bought it.  It was originally for my dad but was too small so I got it instead.  It's pure wool, heavy, but feels like silk and breathes brilliantly.  The fit is perfect and it never needs ironing.  Only problem I have now is that I've worn it so much that the button holes aren't as secure.  I've added a bit of weight too so they are prone to popping open when I sit/stand!	episode_done:True

text:Athleisure button down shirts	labels:I've had good experience with Twillory shirts.  Good stretch and it travels really well.  I find that it may wrinkle a little but if you spray with a water bottle and let dry it'll come out.  My biggest complaint is that I'm normally a 14.5 / 32 with a 38 chest and 31 waist, and i think i'm in between sizes so mine are a little oversized at 15 and 32/33 (since they don't make a one number sleeve length) rather than my buttons popping off.    I haven't brought myself to buy any of the others since they are 40% more at best and if you buy 2 or more you can get the same as the others but a 2 for 1.  I've tried on mizzen and main but they are just way too big for me even at their small / trim size.  You could find those on nordstrom earlier this year for less than $100.	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 27, 2020	labels:Help with see-through white dress shirts.  I've been wanting to get out of my t-shirt and jeans comfort zone and start dressing better. For my first fancy purchase I was going to buy a nice white oxford but every single shirt I looked at was see-through! Is this normal for white dress shirts? If not then could anyone reccomend a good brand that won't advertise my nipples?

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 27, 2020	labels:Looking for basic pair of light grey, logoless joggers for casual outfits and lounging around at home. I've seen the "best of" thread, but I'm honestly still struggling to find a brand or what my size would be, especially if they offer different inseams. I am 6'0, ~152lbs and usually wear size 30 or 31 waist in chinos and 30 inseam for a no-break look at the ankle. Am looking for something tapered but with a bit of room to move, as my legs aren't the skinniest. Ideally would like to stay under $50. Would appreciate for brands and what my size could possibly be.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 27, 2020	labels:**Tailoring limitations (32 to 29/30 inseam, too much?)**  Found a good deal on a suit I like, jacket size and the waist is perfect, but I usually buy a 30” inseam and have the pants hemmed slightly, to get a slight break.  I understand there are limitations to what tailoring can do without changing the overall look or proportions, and there’s no such thing as a good deal on the wrong product. Would this be too much of a change to work or should it work?  Thanks in advance!

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 24, 2020	labels:Hey hey—I bought two pairs of Uniqlo slim fit jeans, waist 35"—and they've both failed by fabric separation in the crotch. They were on sale, they used Kaihara denim, and were made in Bangladesh. My first thought is that fit is the probable culprit, because two pairs in a row is a lot. I've bulked up in the past few years and decided to fit waist to hips rather than actual waist, which probably explains the failure right there—although 35" jeans in other brands didn't have the same failure point, and took much longer to fail. (When I was thinner, I got a lot longer than 10 weeks out of a pair of Uniqlo jeans.)  (Disclosure: My hips are 34"; my waist is currently a mighty 42", 39" at full intake. I'm open to sizing there if anyone thinks it's possible for a denim waist not to migrate downward.)  What's my best option? Should I:  a.) size up 2-3 inches (to hips) to get a more accommodating fit, but still get slim-fit jeans  b.) size up 2-3 inches and abandon slim-fit jeans  c.) size up 2-3 inches and switch to jeans made in Japan, whether slim-fit or not, or  d.) size up to my full waist size and wear my jeans higher?  Losing weight isn't a bad option, either…but I'm not going to lose it overnight, and I'm fresh out of jeans without holes! (I'm going to have to re-stitch an old pair for now. 😅)	episode_done:True

text:How to combine colors	labels:Not another skin color post	episode_done:True
text:How to combine colors	labels:To be honest, a lot of these resources read like the kind of infographics MFA used to upvote; there's the trifecta of pseudo-objective diagrams (e.g. color wheels), dubious pop-psychology (e.g. colors' subconscious associations), and simple but misleading theory (e.g. "seasonal" color schemes) for lurkers looking for 'rules' to bind them.  And like those infographics, I feel that most of these are, at best, an attempt to transform the act of "looking at things and using your brain" into tractable but useless theory (compare: any time someone tries to create a head-shape matrix for glasses), and at worst pretty much junk (particularly the psychology bits). They're also usually based on the fucky assumption that a conventional white American beauty standard is objectively "correct."  Prevailing trends and cultural/subcultural context are way more meaningful determinants of how to use color than a set of temporally/culturally specific rules, and frankly I think the only way to understand those is experience: looking, doing, and thinking. "Caucasians shouldn't wear all black because it offsets their undertone and makes their skin look less vibrant," for instance, sounds reasonable up till you look at actual people who look perfectly fine in it.	episode_done:True

Also, if your primary goal is to see which colors match, don't limit yourself to looking at male clothes, women's section are often bigger if not more extensive than the men's selection; thus they're bound to have larger varieties of color coordinations.

text:How to combine colors	labels:Having read a dozen of these articles, I'm not about to read a dozen more, watch multiple videos, et cetera.  The most obvious flaw in most articles I've seen on this topic is a broad lack of photos. In some others, the flaw is that the photos in no way illustrate the point.  I skipped through one of those videos. It briefly showed the woman being made over in black, and then, at the end of the video, in green. Most of the video seemed to involve large amounts of makeup, which I don't entirely understand -- won't heavy makeup change her skin tone, thus fighting the practice of trying to match clothing to her skin tone? Strategically manipulating one of these things in light of the other two is one impossibility -- strategically manipulating all three variables at the same time serves no experimental purpose, and, in the end, still doesn't really seem to make her look much better. She just goes from being a slight goth to an ordinary woman. Perhaps there would be a point if I bothered to watch the video, but I doubt it.  Is there an article you have that illustrates its point visually? Not just writing out a point and putting irrelevant pictures next to it, but actually having relevant pictures that make the point clear. Don't give me another list, because I would just pick one at random again -- please, just give me one good one.
text:>She just goes from being a slight goth to an ordinary woman  Highlighting this because I’m almost positive this is the point they were making and what they mean  by “more attractive”  She goes from “not normal”(bad and ugly) to “normal”(good and attractive).

text:How to combine colors	labels:OP this isn't directed towards you specifically, but the biggest issue with color theory stuff I have is the lack of why.

I guess what I'm getting at is the premeditated goal when talking about color theory almost always seems to be less about how/why colors work and more here's how to look most conventionally attractive and that's an issue because then these guides can become prescriptive real fast and new users then cling to these rules and it stunts creativity.

I don’t understand what seems to be the lurker notion of “wanting to dress better to blend in better.” If wearing the shit I wear labels me as an “attention seeker,” then I’ll wear that badge proudly.

text:Lurker concept of dressing better is dressing “good” in a mainstream sense. Something that is restrained without being flashy. Something that other guys will say “cool jacket!” But won’t be scary to wear.   It’s how the basic Bastard came around. Inoffensive but still good.   It’s hard to talk to my friend who clearly wants to dress better and cooler but just can’t. He loves all the stuff I wear cause it’s cool and preppy (he’s also New England born and bred) but he’s in the more jock/frat category than I am (engineering nerd/artsy) and I think the idea of stepping too far out of line will be met with ridicule. I don’t really notice that stuff cause I’ve been doing it for so long, but for him even a new jacket or sneakers is really stretching it and he’s hesitant to step away from normal guy stuff.	labels:Yeah, I think I fall into the trap of dressing like this for so long that it’s sorta second nature at this point. So what is out of the norm for some people feels comfortable for me. I understand the fear of stepping away from the norm, and also understand that’s where most lurkers are. But I don’t understand the mindset of different=always bad. Idk maybe it just boils down to simply wanting to fit in

text:What have I done?	labels:Here's the thing. You said a "trilby is a fedora."  Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that.  As someone who is a haberdasher who studies classy hats, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls trilbies fedoras. If you want to be "specific" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.  If you're saying "fedora family" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of fedorae, which includes things from porkpies to safari hats to cool indiana jones hats.  So your reasoning for calling a trilby a fedora is because random people "call the classy hats fedoras?" Let's get pith hats and tricorns in there, then, too.  Also, calling something a duster or trench coat? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A trilby is a trilby and a member of the fedora family. But that's not what you said. You said a trilby is a fedora, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the fedora family fedoras, which means you'd call porkpies, Safari hats, and other hats fedoras, too. Which you said you don't.  It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 22, 2020	labels:Why are hooded garments almost never modeled with the hood up?   I  keep my head shaved (bald) and prefer hoods to hats. Part of my problem  is a lot of hoods don't land far enough forward on my head so I want to  see them modeled with the hood up. Most of my problem is that when I'm  shopping online about 90% of hooded garments are not modeled with the  hood up. It seems intentional, anyone know why?  Admittedly I want my hood to fall farther forward than most might, like to my  eyebrows, but most of what I order and see online, when they are  modeled, land with the edge behind the top of the forehead. I get that  this is consistent with the hat trend of wearing the edge behind the  hairline, for whatever reason, but I'm looking for function over style.	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 21, 2020	labels:Kinda a strange question but wondering what people think: I really like the brand Noah NYC and I've been considering picking up a hoodie from them for some time. I like their sustainability focus and their aesthetic fits my style. The only problem is that my name is Noah. Basically, I can't decide if it's cool to wear a hoodie with my name printed on it, or if it's narcissistic/just kinda cringey. I think I would definitely wear the brand if that wasn't my name, but I also feel like because it is, that might be the only thing people notice when they see me wear it. Thoughts?
text:So my name is Michael K. I've been gifted some Michael Kors items in the past, and of course the monogram is MK. The worst that ever happens is we kind of have a laugh about it or there will be a jovial comment like "congrats on being a designer!". It's all in good fun and to my knowledge nobody thinks negatively of me.   I will admit I don't think about buying MK items myself, but that might be more because I personally dont like the brand. If you like the stuff go for it IMO.	labels:	episode_done:True

I can’t quite describe why I think they’re dorky but I will say that most people I see wearing transitions just aren’t very fashionable people. To stereotype a bit, these people mostly fall under the dorky/nerdy types and tend to be older people as well.  Of course, it could simply be that people who like transition glasses tend to be less concerned about appearances and value functionality more. If you’re confident about your overall look, I don’t think transition glasses would look bad at all.   Now if you’re a so-so or horrible dresser, transition glasses become more of an eye sore.	episode_done:True

text:Transition Lenses/Glasses	labels:Like others have mentioned, it’s entirely how you feel about your look and ultimately your decision when it comes down to it. However my advice would be against it, I find that while they try to be the best of both worlds with glasses and sunglasses they just end up being a worse version of either. Either they’re bad sunglasses because the glasses part is small, or they’re weird looking glasses because it’s a big sunglasses frame. As well I personally find the awkward grey tinge they have in the “mid” light conditions to be very tacky/dorky looking. Like many others have said, with the price of cheap frames now a days you can just get a cheaper pair of both. Prescription sunglasses or contacts for days you need sunglasses is likely the better option for you.
text:Yeah after all the advice I got here and your to top it off, I think you are on point  This is why, my store has two sizes 51 and 53, 53 looks big on me, I need 51 as I wear 52 usually anyways  but if I go with transition, the guy told me I should get 53, as the transition on 51 would make it look smaller  &#x200B;  so yeah, you are on point here, it will look either bad as sunglasses cuz it's small or bad as eyeglasses cuz it's big  &#x200B;  I ended up choosing 51 eyeglasses, and then I will just get prescription sunglasses on the side by changing one of the old lenses on my frame - I think that's the best way to go on about this, transitional glasses are like tablets - neither a phone nor a laptop  &#x200B;  Thanks for the advice, I might make a new post later black plastic frames what sunglass lens colour to get	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Transition Lenses/Glasses	labels:I thought transitional lenses were cool in middle school. This kid Dane had blue ones. Nowadays I think they look tacky, I’d rather get prescription aviators or wayfarers, personally. They’re timeless in style.
text:>tacky  There is a model for this one with a metal piece running above the nose - sorta more aviator like, but yeah aviator looks really good on me, but I would want prescription sunglasses for aviators - they need that dark tint I think, but you are right wayfarers and aviators are timeless and that's what I am going for really - no extra stuff  &#x200B;  I think these frames are pretty classic and timeless, but it's not because of the looks I am choosing it - it's the most lightweight glasses in the market right or one of them	labels:Yeah, aviator styles prescription glasses are basically grandpa glasses.  I’d be careful choosing lightweight frames, especially if they cost a lot because it’s easier to damage. All it takes is one drunk night to wake up with an arm bending at 90 degrees.
text:Yup - grandpa style, think the same haha  So do you think on these frames the gray colour would look dorky/nerdy? or idk enhance the look? that's the 2 sides of argument I am getting  &#x200B;  I am pretty good with my frames, but yeah they are super light weight and well titanium, so technically they can be fixed again idk how much it would cost, but I am pretty good with that (and would probably carry a hard case in a bagpack when doing some adventures)	labels:I guess depending on your face shape these glasses will look good. Rounder frames typically call for more angular/defined faces, otherwise they will accentuate the curve of your face.  As far as transitional go I would skip it on these frames. They got like a Morpheus kinda matrix vibe
text:Haha yes thank you that's what they remind me off too Morpheus, and again I don't want to go into that realm of weird fashion, disco/idk what to even call it...these on me look so good, that I personally think adding anything to them like slight tint might take away it's character - or who knows maybe enhance it as other claim  Face is oval mostly with faded beard sharpening the jaw a bit. I don't do full rounds, I do these oval shapes mostly, works nice, aviator looks nice too...full round is not for me, looks harry potter like	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Transition Lenses/Glasses	labels:Glasses are cheap enough now (via something like warby Parker) where you can experiment with this style and see if you make it work or not.   As a fellow glasses user - I treat my glasses as an accessory. I have 10 pairs I alternate between (though truly 2-3 in heavy rotation). Warby Parker changed the game and made this possible.   So you do you man - see if you can make it work and if not then well you have a pair you can use at home :)  Me personally? I have prescription sunglasses and glasses for separate occasions haha if these are more than warby prices I personally would not opt for transitions  Hope this helps!
text:>Warby Parker  I thought I had enough frames haha  I have a similar plastic ones like the Warby Parker already - will be making them sunglasses as the prescription on them is old  &#x200B;  but for these frames, they are expensive yes, but for a good reason really (and I don't mind paying cuz I wear glasses 14-17 hours and won't be doing eye surgery anytime soon)  ...I think like you, in terms of having sunglasses on the side - and prescription seperate  What concerns me the most is the looks - if it will be ruined, having silver frames and some transitions on an expensive frame, most of my family tells me don't do those gimmicks, but 1 is like it might be cool and enhance the look of the shiny silver frame? idk	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Transition Lenses/Glasses	labels:Friends of ours were married in a beautiful 200 year old timber church on a gorgeously sunny day in the middle of a perfect winter.  The bride wore glasses, they were transitions, and the light streaming through the stained glass caused them to change colour. Every shot of her during the ceremony looked as though she was wearing sunglasses. I don't like transitions.
text:That's really funny, I was thinking about photos outdoor too, and decided that even if it might be cool sometimes with slight tint, I think it's better to put some aviator sunglasses and rock that on a photo instead if you r going for that look in a photo  Idk I think they are a good tech/idea, but not quite there yet	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Transition Lenses/Glasses	labels:I’ve had them on and off since the 90s... (thought they were super cool when I was a kid).. they ARE cool, but the worst part about them is they don’t stay dark while you’re driving, so somewhat useless to me. As others have mentioned glasses are pretty cheap nowadays so getting spare shades is the way to go. At the moment my back up pair is transition. Oh and no one will ever notice or care that your glasses are transition, and people don’t actually have an opinion on them. Also— when you’re inside they’re completely clear like regular glasses.
text:No for sure, you are right it definetly is wroth it I think  It's just for me, it came down to look, if I get transition I had to go 1 size up, so I could have sunglass look, but when it turns white it would look kinda big on me indoors and I didn't want that as I am more indoor than outdoor  If I got my size, then transitions as sunglasses would look small on me outdoor, and would give me this Matrix Morpheus look, plus taking photos - not always do I want shades, I want my eyes to speak  &#x200B;  but yeah if you have big frames already, and mostly plastic, transition would work, but I decided I will either make my old glasses as tinted sunglasses or buy new aviator sunglasses from cheaper online place (just gotta figure out which one is good, I did buy from Firmoo before) - idk what else is good  &#x200B;  but for you - I suggest lookign up at different transition models - there is one xtractive or something that gives more tint when behind the wheel - they got many models for different needs, times and so on	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Transition Lenses/Glasses	labels:I wear transition RX raybans and have no issue whatsoever because they really just look like normal sunglasses when dark and look like hipstery thick framed glasses when clear.	episode_done:True
text:Transition Lenses/Glasses	labels:Perhaps transition lenses have improved and it's a case of only noticing the bad ones, but I definitely see them tinted indoors occasionally and they look dopey. Like wearing sunglasses indoors in general.  I'd be uncomfortable buying them as a primary pair of glasses without trying out the transition for the day and seeing them actually transition quickly in my normal haunts.
text:They do transition quicker now with gen 8 version, but still not that quick  Takea about 3-4mins depending on where you live, colder climates are slower and tint gets darker, warmer is faster, but gets less tinted, in a car it doesn't work for those who drive that might be a big consideration  I was just thinking from style perspective and not looking like a nerd or ruining the look. The guy above is right, he said the same thing as my glass store if you get one you gotta go 1 size bigger, cuz they usually seem to make your glasses look smaller  But if you r indoor, your glasses look big, so you sacrifice on looks basically  I think they would look good if your frames are big and plastic made, I'm taking big big frames or if your pair is sold as sunglasses too, but I think having separate sunglasses is more practical, a hustle to carry, but does a better job if you got the space for it	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Transition Lenses/Glasses	labels:I use them out of convenience mostly. After spending 15 years carrying both prescription glasses and prescription sunglasses, it's pretty neat to only have one thing to carry.
text:The functionality aspect I get it  I just don't know style wise if those frames as classic and elegant as they look would be ruined by the slight tint or enhance it  My store told me to go 1 size bigger if I get transitions as it makes the glasses feel smaller usually	labels:I don't really care much for it to be honest, it's mostly the frame that matters. That said having tinted glasses on a cloudy winter morning is a bit annoying but these things are sensitive. Anyway I don't wear my glasses constantly as I've got 9/10 eyes. If I had to, I'd probably opt for something different, like these sun lenses you can clip on your regular glasses.
text:Yeah, I was thinking that too, there is a sunglasses clip for this one actually, although carrying that around - might as well have a sunglasses, putting 2 glasses on each other is like looking from telescope with glasses haha  &#x200B;  That's my feeling, but it looks alright	labels:	episode_done:True

text:What are your predictions for 2021 suit style?	labels:Working within a multi brand store, a lot of what the buying team is seeing is relaxed fits, patch pockets and a pretty standard over arching lapel size (let’s say 2in), but it still keeping towards formal regimented shoulders (with very subtle roping) and small amounts of taper to the trouser and waist. Almost half of the suits  reviewed having pleats, but less function and more to bring an elongated look when sans jackets. Lots of hopsack open weaves giving a more draped look. I’m saying all this at least in our market, when people are looking for suits it’s become clear people want far less patterns, and moving towards subtle pinheads and puppy’s tooth, or even tone on tone 5mm window pane. In darker colours even coming into summer. COVID has pushed suits in our market back towards the cleaner look, with textured shirts and a little more fun with ties. Saying all this though it’s super dependent on where you are in the world and where you associate yourself in the corresponding circles.  So tldr: shrug*

text:What are your predictions for 2021 suit style?	labels:I would say that suits in general have been on the downtrend among white-collar types; a lot of jobs just don’t demand it anymore. I think the pandemic and bankruptcies you mentioned may push that trend further, but it was already on its way.  As far a changes in the style of common suits: I think super wide/skinny lapels are definitely on their way out (if they’re not already there), looser fits may make a comeback, and I feel that somewhat bolder colors might be a bit more popular.   As for the more fashion-forward: I feel like I’ve been seeing more belted suits, skirt suits/skirts + blazers (on men; @ Harry Styles), and asymmetric details. Obviously that’s getting into the world of fashion show stuff, so it doesn’t influence most of us that much, but it’s worth talking about.
text:> I think the pandemic and bankruptcies you mentioned may push that trend further, but it was already on its way.  I actually wonder if the opposite will happen. After a year of sitting at home wearing sweatpants every day of the week people might be in the mood to dress up again and suiting could see a revival... maybe with more casual details to ease the transition? Unlined jackets, drawstring pants, patch pockets, stretch blend fabrics.	labels:That’s a possibility for sure, but I think only for a small group who really enjoys tailored clothing; I feel like the vast majority of guys really just see that sort of clothing as a burden. That said, I myself have been fleshing out my formalwear closet a lot since the pandemic started, so I hope to put it to use once I can :)	episode_done:True

text:Hooded Sweatshirt Roundup	labels:Once you get over a certain level of $ point, it's really hard to rank basic hoodies over one another, it mostly comes down to the fit that you want.  I've tried a lot of hoodies from cheap to expensive and most of them are as comfortable as each other. The article mentions JEs villain hoodies which are probably out of fashion these days but JE still produces other cuts of hoodies such as the beach hoodie, raglan hoodie and oversized cropped hoodie which all have different fits and are all as well made as each other. People who rave about a particular brand of hoodie are highly likely to be just really happy with the fit, the quality and comfort isn't gonna really differ between RC, Norse Projects, Champion and such. Even coveted things like loopwheeler also doesn't provide anything unique either when it comes to comfort.  I've rambled but if I had an advice to give to hoodie buyers who are mostly focused on fit and comfort, it would be to identify a fit that you want and just start from the midrange brand that you can find of that fit.
text:I bought a JE zip up hoodie. I also have Stone Island and Burberry hoodies, as well as American Apparel and other cheaper ones. I won't say spending $300+ (cad) on hoodies is smart, but the main difference I note is the cut. Comfort, like you said, isn't too different unless you get into cashmere, but the difference in cut and overall shape and sizing is much better. I definitely wanna get my hands on a Todd Snyder Champion hoodie though, that's right up my alley.	labels:	episode_done:True

I'm looking for some euro inspired trends.  I feel like I have a good base going.  I bought a couple of pairs of athletic slim black jeans - Lucky 410's, a pair of Adidas shell tops and stan smiths, a pink/lavender semi-casual button-down and a gray peacoat.  I like matching some of my darker sweaters with my black jeans and a pea coat.  I like that monochrome look with white, black and gray but I'm looking to branch out more.    This is the first time I'm really paying attention to my fashion and my wardrobe and I'm looking for some suggestions.  Right now, I like leaning towards more of a conservative or clean look, but I'm open to suggestions if this helps.	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 18, 2020	labels:I recently bought several items for my bf from American Giant. I have to say, I am very disappointed. Not only were all the sweatpants out of stock in sizes under XL, their customer service is awful. I expected delays because of COVID and the holiday season, but I placed my order on Dec 7 and it still hadn't even been processed (packed up), yet alone sent. I have sent 3 emails, none of which have gotten a response. They also took their phone number off their website (but I found it on google). Additionally, they automatically imposed a 40USD customs fee on my order (I live outside the US), even though the order was under the customs limit (150USD).   I am so annoyed with the lack of communication and the huge delays even though their website promised delivery by Christmas. I almost feel like cancelling my order.

text:First you gotta ask yourself what do you mean looking better? Like what are your goals? Expressing yourself, having fun, looking more conventionally attractive etc...

I'm a 27 year old guy, mostly wearing hoodies, since, well it seems to be the only thing that i can wear without looking weird, but i noticed nearly everyone has a flannel shirt.
text:Definitely not.  That said, if you are 27 and you think hoodies are the only thing that doesn't look weird, that's on you, not other people. A flannel is a perfectly good completely casual shirt that an adult man can wear. It's of the same level of casual as a hoodie. So maybe try it out!  Edit for autocorrect	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 17, 2020	labels:I bought an Amazon basics men’s puffer jacket in a large this week and loved it when it first arrived. I really like the style of a black puffer jacket. The major issue is the cut of the jacket. At first glance it appears to fit well, but if I lean or stretch at all it cuts into my armpits. Even just putting my hands on the wheel when driving causes it to cut into my armpits. I want to find an alternative to the Amazon basics that is the same style but perhaps higher quality or a better fit. I have been looking at the Uniqlo men’s ultralight down puffer jacket. Does anyone have any experience with it or other similar jackets and know if it fits well under the armpits?  TLDR Amazon basics puffer jacket too tight under armpits. Looking for a similar jacket, perhaps the Uniqlo ultralight down jacket and looking for advice on fit.	episode_done:True

text:The best running shorts — 12 pairs tested (full post in comments)	labels:There is no reason to get a pair of $160 running shorts   If you want to go for a nicer pair of shorts in terms of looks and function than tracksmith is great. VC, session and twilight are all great options that look good and feel good running and at half the cost. Still pricey but compared to other high end tunning shorts by nike or Adidas they are comparable   But you can also get great shorts for $20 by new balance, brooks, nike, adidas, saucony and so on that are great comfortable and look decent. The main difference I've found between a 20 dollar shorts and a 80 dollar pair is durability.

text:I feel like the “athleisure” trend was never meant for minorities in the real world.  You try athleisure you’ll definitely feel it.   For minorities, fashion has very narrow limits.

text:I know “fashion” but people of minorities are always forced to try better. Some Insights	labels:I'm Asian, not black, but this reminds me of something I've consciously learned to do in my career, to try to actively contradict stereotypes in order to encourage colleagues to actually engage with me as an individual with my own strengths, weaknesses, and personality. In the U.S., stereotypes aren't nearly as harmful for Asians as they are for black men, but in the workforce I've seen a lot of Asians plateau at the lower level, informal team lead positions, while getting stuck being hidden away when it comes time to build relationships or manage long-term, strategic goals.  I've played up my blue collar background in order to disarm the "nerd" stereotype, and I've played up my military background as necessary to remind people that I have management and leadership experience, and that I'm not just the guy hired to be some technical specialist, or the one-off task. It's also an easy way to connect with other vets.   Early in my white collar career, I retained my military haircut, maintained a stronger (rather than a leaner/cardio-friendly) build, because from what I've seen, a bit of a subconscious bias about blue collar = power lifter while white collar = weekend marathoner.  Now that I've climbed the ladder a bit I've been able to back off some, and adopt a bit more of the style and look of a mid-career white collar professional (but in a fashion-conscious way). I've also gotten older so I haven't hit my strength (or my cardio) goals in a while, and I look more like a white collar professional that way, too.   And maybe I'm overthinking things, but I found that leaning into meathead or combat vet stereotypes allowed me to avoid being pigeonholed like so many other Asians who came before me. So this linked study at least seems roughly analogous to what I had already seemingly experienced, albeit in a very different context with very different considerations.

text:I'm a PoC in Canada and even up here I notice how clothing changes perceptions but I had to go beyond fashionable to conservative business suits to notice it. I wore expensive trendy minimalist streetwear and still got followed in stores and stopped by the police in my own neighbourhood. Now that I wear suits on the daily, I notice how different you can be treated. I get smiles in the streets and less suspicion.  I've personally been a believer in not judging people for what they wear but until societal perceptions change, you gotta play the game.  I still get asked if I speak English tho.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - December 15, 2020	labels:This year, I decide to clean out/upgrade my closet. It was the most clothing I've ever donated at once and also the most clothing I've ever bought in a year.  I love clothing but hate buying clothes because of financial fears and the mindset of "this sweater will hold" even though I don't wear it because I don't like how it looks on me. Talking to my wife about this, she suggested that when I have bought new clothes, I feel  better about myself and happier so I should spend some money on these I actually need.  It was fun to actually buy everything but the biggest thing I learned is that I focused to much on what this sub said on how things should fit and how similar clothes I bought fit on other people. When I've spent money on things to only feel like I don't look good in it because of what other's in this sub have said, really sucks. Logically I understand that we all have different body shapes but I can't quite get over that mental hurdle when I've purchased new items. I've bought quite a few things this year, but have returned nearly the same amount because I didn't feel happy in it. I've been working on how I feel and look without trying to rely on this sub for it and it's been easier. It's also really annoying that company sizing seem to be everywhere. I think there is only one piece of clothing I bought this year that I would feel comfortable buying again because of the fit and consistency.  Currently wearing a sweater that I still don't know if I like because I don't feel comfortable because it feels like it doesn't "fit" the way is supposed to.
text:I totally get focusing too much on what this sub says is "correct fit" I got a new stand collar flannel from uniqlo I knew it was going to have a looser more dropped shoulder fit and I still posted in daily questions asking for opinions (which ofc gets me 2 comments one saying the shoulder is fine the other saying it's too loose/big) I thought about it for a bit and just said fuck it i like the look and I'm trying to invoke more peasanty/loose/relaxed feel anyway.  Also a lot of it is taking fit pics at an angle/focus that matches what you see with your eyes. Just moving the camera/phone back, forward, up, down a foot or 2 will totally change your proportions and will prolly create a photo that makes you say "that doesn't look like me at all when I look in the mirror" personally at this point I incorrectly get this sinking feeling in my gut and start thinking I'm wayyyyy uglier than I thought I was. I spent an hour and a half yesterday fucking around with different heights and distances until I found a set up where I felt like I was getting a "true pic of me" and taking fit pics with it today I Already feel a bit better about myself.

My issue is color.  If I were getting the "classic" chucks, I would be going with the all-white version.  I plan on wearing them with shorts and crew socks for the most part.

Does anyone have any suggestions or experiences with either color.  White would match my socks a bit better (though the AT retro stripe ones that I usually wear are getting faded) but the different colored sole seems a bit funky in the website's pictures.

text:Is Money Important for Style? - The Style and Direction Podcast	labels:Money is neither necessary nor sufficient for style, but it's extremely helpful. You can be all style, no money, with thrifty finds, but you'll always be limited. And you can be all money, no style, which we see often enough.  But if you want the style, almost inevitably you're going to need the money. It's not just about convenience (ordering custom clothes instead of looking for thrifts, etc) but about the fact that tailored, designer, or otherwise luxury items will be out of reach without the $
text:Agreed! It all depends on what you want from your wardrobe.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Is Money Important for Style? - The Style and Direction Podcast	labels:It’s funny to me. I live in Southern California, home to the entertainment business and some of the best clothing shops in the country, but the hierarchy of fashion and money isn’t linear. There’s some old school law firms where everyone wears suits, and   studio executives often wears suits, but bottom-rung business-side entertainment folks (eg, low level agency people making $40,000 a year) *have to wear suits* too. At the same time, actors, tech people, and high ranking people in the business get to dress casually - casual dress is becoming a mark of success.	episode_done:True

text:Is Money Important for Style? - The Style and Direction Podcast	labels:I was thinking about this in relation to my own style -- where I spend and where I don't. For instance, I'm really particular about how dress clothes fit, so I spend a lot on tailoring because it matters there. Other big ticket items are outerwear, because they tend to dominate an outfit. However, I definitely spend less on casual/basic things like jeans, tees, and chinos. Often, I'll wear $20 chinos with a $50 sweater, a $600 jacket and $200 shoes, so the price-per-piece for certain outfits are often from the different tiers. To me, it's about knowing what items are truly "making the outfit" and spending the most where it matters.
text:Definitely. That routinely happens when I wear my few Ring Jacket/MTM pieces with trousers or shirts I've thrifted.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Is Money Important for Style? - The Style and Direction Podcast	labels:Money can buy nice clothes, but money doesn’t buy taste.
text:It can certainly rent someone else's taste long enough for a tasteless rich person to look nice.	labels:Only if they're being styled by someone, and even then, that's no guarantee they pull off whatever look they're being styled in.
text:So in a past life I spent a bunch of time around really rich people. 1%er types. There were a few people who dressed like shit, of course, and that was mostly a badge of honour thing (I'm so rich I can wear a stained rugby shirt from my old school and no one can say a damn thing about it, or wear a poorly cut cheap suit to underline your frugalness). Mostly, though, everyone looked great. It felt a bit impersonal and abstract and rule-based (for the men, women's fashion was a lot more varied), but if you aren't into clothes and aren't looking close you wouldn't have noticed that (and you aren't looking close, generally, because if you are in a room with a bunch of 1%ers you are almost certainly looking for something from the conversation that isn't aesthetic appreciation of the act of wearing clothing).   There is something out there that looks good for everyone, and money can put you in it. Yes, people can make mistakes in what they think they can pull off, or want something with actual personality that might fail because their personality is loathesome or awful. But you can pay to look good, sometimes very good.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - December 13, 2020	labels:Weekend recap:  Seattle lost. That makes me happy.  Oregon State also lost. That makes me sad.  Also, an indictment of the state of sports this year: while watching the Oregon State-Stanford game, ESPN's ticker updated after USC's win over UCLA, noting that USC would meet Washington in the Pac-12 title game. It also informed that, if USC were to be ineligible due to COVID-19, Colorado would represent the South, and if Washington were ineligible, Oregon would represent the North. It's all academic now, with Oregon State's loss, but if they'd beaten Stanford, the Beavers would have improved to 3-3 (3-2 division), versus Oregon's 3-2 (2-2 divison, with a head-to-head loss to Oregon State). Yet, Oregon was already anointed as the second-in-succession to the North's crown. Lame. Or has ESPN just gone retarded?  Also, 5-0 Ohio State needs special dispensation to play in the Big Ten championship (which should be made), and are considered a likely lock for a playoff spot. 5-0 USC? Not even a second glance. I'm curious to see how it'll all fall out if USC wins, and Ohio State loses, however unlikely that is to happen.  Final thought: the CFP committee completely screwed the pooch by not going to a six-team format. Or even eight. This was the perfect year for it.	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 13, 2020	labels:Heyo,   I'm looking for some chino pants and am mostly concerned about the material.   Around a year ago, I bought some RSQ chinos and they were great, I liked the material, the fit (slim straight) was just right, and the cost was worth it ($45 a pair, BOGO 50% off)!   I decided to buy some recently and despite the website (Tilly's) saying they were the same fit/style, they felt off. The material isn't what it used to be I guess despite having the same ratio (97% cotton/3% cotton), it feels thinner. The pants also feel more loose on me, I made sure to order the same fit but I guess that changed too.   I'm interested in any recommendations where the pant material definitely felt nice and worth the asking price.   As for my price range, I wouldn't feel right spending more than $50 per pair as I'm just a college student.	episode_done:True

text:Schott 538 Nubuck Cowhide Mechanic Jacket	labels:What perfect timing! I also just received this Schott mechanic jacket! It's my first Schott jacket and I love it! People here don't seem to appreciate the contrasting collar, but I think it makes the jacket stand out! It's a little touch that makes the design more unique and not as likely to see the same jacket from other makers. And the goatskin leather for the collar makes it very comfortable against my neck, and I wouldn't want the waxy/oily cowhide rubbing against my skin.  *** I love the chambray liner on the inside. I was turned off by a lot of other Schott jackets having the warm flannel liner as it would make the jacket harder to wear in the warmer seasons.    The buttons are definitely a stand out too! Makes it a lot easier to layer, which I believe was their intention. ***  And I'm very satisfied with the fit! I typically wear size M in my shirts, and I juggled over what size to buy, but eventually settled on sizing up to a L for the Schott, and I'm glad I did! The jacket has enough room to layer a sweater for the winter, but still looks great by itself. I was worried sizing up would make the jacket too boxy, but to my surprise it actually does have a slight V shape in the body, with a slight taper from the chest to the sweep. and the sleeves are not baggy, despite sizing up. If this was a moto or cafe racer style, I would understand the look to keep it super slim. But I feel this jacket style is more of a work-wear style, and that looks better a little boxy. ***  If I had to be very picky, I wish the sleeves were shorter, but I get it's for bikers to keep their wrists warm when riding. And the liner in the sleeves is polyester, which I thought was a little cheap for a 810 dollar jacket.  ***  Overall I'm happy with it. I  did not pay full price either. It was on sale at Nordstrom but it sold out very quick.
text:Nice! I also got it from Nordstrom on that sale! It definitely went out of stock very quickly. As for the sleeves liner, i agree it feels a bit cheap but i think most jackets like this has a polyester lining to keep your arms cool and also to make it easy to slide in and out. Glad you are enjoying it!	labels:What do you think of the fit? Did you get your typical size?
text:I think the fit is pretty good. The sleeves are long like you said, but you can roll up the cuff one, and the thick leather keeps the cuff pretty much in place so it's not flapping about. I also took a gamble on the size and got a medium. I measure about 37-38in in chest, 33-34 sleeve, 5'11 and about 160lbs. Definitely not the V shape athletic build, but this still fit pretty well at a medium. Overall, definitely happy with the fit as it is not too tight but also not super big on me.	labels:I have a 40 inch chest with broad shoulders, 6'0 and 180 lbs. And I got a L, which seems to be in proportion with the size M you got.  I'm pretty excited to start wearing it! I've been trying on outfits in front of my mirror this morning lol. Think it looks great over a flannel or thick denim shirt!

text:I picked up a pair of black Thursday Boots Captains a couple of months ago. The company has been bashed on reddit pretty thoroughly in the past, but for $200 I'm quite pleased with them. Most of the "Buy ____ instead" suggestions I read involve waiting for sales on factory seconds or things like the redwings that straight-up cost more money.  The version I got is basically a combat boot for a smart casual office dress code, and they are great for that. Quality-wise they're worlds better than the $100 boots that they replaced.  In your case (Colorado, snowy sidewalks, etc) I might lean towards one of the "rugged and resilient" leather options.  If you want a lug sole, they have 2 color options on the captain for that, and the Diplomat has a wedge sole and a moc toe instead of a cap toe.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - December 11, 2020	labels:After looking at the casual blazer thread I just realized why I never liked or understood Paul Harnden when it was really big a few years ago. I think a lot of it was shoehorned into a more aggressive aesthetic than would suit some of those blazers. And we were still steeped in slim fit bottoms at the time, and people just threw a long, looser fit blazer over tight black twisted leg pants and called it a day. I think it's a great look when it's cohesive, but it came across as very bandwagon-y when it was worn with your typical Julius and BBS type stuff.  Interestingly, Elena Dawson - which is the same thing - was typically worn more cohesively, and I always really liked her work.

text:Permanent Style - The Cold-Colour Capsule	labels:The way he handles the idea of cool/warm colors is strange. Like, he writes blue is a warm color. What?

You can easily find warm green and cool green, so is blue, so is every color.
text:Welllll... he answered me on instagram, and it seems like he *was* talking about "cool" in this sense, but he didn't really explain that, and also meant to imply unsaturated / whatever, and that part was more important...

text:>I think he means tonally neutral, bland, desaturated colors  I would argue that’s what cold means, while blue is generally cold, I don’t think cold means “more blue”, it’s more about the relative saturation and intensity of the color, basically you have to judge what makes a certain color warm or cold totally in comparison to other similar shades, not as a general sliding scale of “brown is warm, blue is cold, always”, though, like I said this is all a semi useable way of describing it.  Going back to the audio examples, I always see vinyl described as sounding “warmer” than digital, when I first heard albums I knew on vinyl my first reaction was “wow that sounds really different”, immediately followed by “wow, I _definitely_ wouldn’t describe that as warmer”, so, I do get the confusion	labels:Exactly, which is best exemplified when Simon talks about certain blues being warmer (more saturated) vs cooler (less saturated)	episode_done:True

text:he's probably focusing less on navy bc he views it in a more formal context. Navy is mentioned as being a decent colour to add as a adjunct rather than a main focus. Certain shades of brown are colder than others because they have more cool tones like greys compared to a red-cast warmer brown.  I just posted this as an interesting illustration of how someone can think about colour, it's not meant to be a definitive authoritative post	labels:But grey isn't a cool tone. Grey is a neutral tone.  I understand if the premise excludes navy, but if it does, shouldn't th title be a "Neutral-Colour Capsule" or something like that?

text:Yeah now that I’ve taken some time to think about it, I see what’s going on.   Simon’s definition of cold vs warm has to do with saturation of colour and undertones, which is why cool or warm browns and greys can exist, respectively. Your definition of cold vs warm seems to focus on the hue/colour spectrum from red to blue.   That’s what I was saying before, you just have different starting points/references so cool/warm mean different things to you. I seem to remember some confusion in his comments section addressing the same thing.	labels:Undertones make sense, but it seems like low saturation is a bigger part of his argument. Like, a cream with cool undertones quickly turns into a light blue. And I think of "cream" and "beige" and "taupe" as being warmer off-whites, and greys and stone as being more neutral / cooler on average. But he uses all of those interchangably, avoiding only "tan" and "khaki" and the very clearly warm terms like that.  He doesn't specify cool grays, cool browns, or cool olives. There are definitely warm / yellowish olives, I'd say it's easier to find warm ones than cool ones. And there are definitely cooler dark greens. Desaturation is a bigger part of his point, and he doesn't really address it.  Oh, and that's not to mention blacks, which... if they were cool, they just wouldn't be blacks. And blacks are technically saturated, too. True black is tonally neutral and fully saturated, not sure how they fit into either point he's trying to make, really.  If I were trying to implement this, I'd replace blacks with navies, but maybe look for dark desaturated blues where I can find them.

text:Congrats on being able to darn yourself. That's something I need to practice.  I too find it strange that sewing crafts have been deemed "unmanly." I learned how to sew (as well as cross-stitch, latch hook, needlepoint, and a bunch of other thread crafts; not to mention ironing too) when I was really little. I think its more "manly" to be able to take care of your own wardrobe (amongst other "feminine" household tasks) than it is to have to get someone else to do it for you.  Plus, some of my favorite clothing label and/or designers are men.	labels:It's a shame that more men aren't into it!

I love other British producers, have Trickers (official shoemaker for the Prince of Wales no less), Cheaneys and a good chunk of my wardrobe is SEH Kelly but that landed gentry aesthetic from Barbour just doesn't sit. I'd say it's an Irish thing but there's no shortage of people walking around Dublin in Barbour and I even remember a period in the late 80's / 90s when wax jackets were all the rage in rural Mayo.
text:Any thoughts on Private White VC?	labels:I mean they sell clothes that would fall into the Barbour aesthetic, I wouldn't wear any of their wax pieces, but they also sell other beautiful classic pieces. I'd be all over their wool overcoats. Their vibe is more towards the permanent style crowd but with as much as I spend on clothes I can't really claim the working class hero angle.

text:Ordered from Shoe The Bear (rant, experience in post)	labels: On Cyber Monday 2018, I bought a pair of Suede Chelsea boots from Shoe The Bear and they're one of my favorite pairs of kicks. Fit was awesome, quality was amazing for what I paid (~$70). I've worn these boots 100+ time and still holding up great.  Fast forward to this past Cyber Monday. I wanted a pair of cognac/brown colored Chelseas from Shoe The Bear. They arrived within a few days fron Portugal. I was so excited to open the box....and they are completely the wrong color.

text:Ordered from Shoe The Bear (rant, experience in post)	labels:Sorry, this isn't directly helpful, but I've ordered from Shoe The Bear two or three times. The first time I kept the boots (suede chelseas) and they were uncomfortable and never broke in, but did very soon expand to way outside the size of my feet despite following their guidelines and ordering what was eventually 2 sizes below my normal size (having ordered multiples to test) leaving my feet to flop about at the heel and yet rub on my toes to the point of leaving red and slightly blistered skin.  Each time after that I've sent them back, based both on sizing and the appearance of quality. I would never buy them at the full prices they charge based on the workmanship and materials they use, and even on sale, they are quite sneaky about how returns work - they put it out loudly that they include a return label, but you have to dig to note that that return label is then deducted from the cost of your refund, and it's not cheap.   The last time I did this, I couldn't use the return label at the post office, even though the website said I could, so I paid for my own postage. When they did refund me, not only had they still tried to charge me for usage of the label, but they appeared to have applied it twice. I contacted the customer support to query this, at which point they asked me if I had used the return label, which A) they should really know at that point, and B) wouldn't have explained the extra charge anyway. They said they would refund it and I should see it in my account sometime that week (it was on a Monday). Guess what? No refund - I had to contact them *again* the following Wednesday to remind them, and only then were the accounts department finally moved to action.   Good deal on sale or not, I would never order from Shoe The Bear again.
text:Their customer service SUCKS.  They're not even responding to my last e-mail of asking why they're accusing me of treating the leather myself and if they're going to anything to assist me considering I'm a repeat buyer. I sent them the e-mail within minutes of recieving the package and do not even have any knowledge on treating leather.  Thanks for sharing your story.  Hopefully potential buyers see my post and yours when searchinf for Shoe The Bear on Google.  It sucks I spoke really highly of them previously on Reddit and to friends being like "This company from Portugal is the shit, check them out".  Fuck this company.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What Do You Wear With Strong Sentimental Value?	labels:I have two ll bean flannels which I've had since I was 13. I'm 30 now. I'm not sure if they have molded around my body, or if my body has grown around them. I will always smile when putting these on, as so much life has been lived in them. I plan on keeping them in good repair until it is literally impossible.  I also smile since I noticed my grandpa got one of the same pattern around the time I did.  I thought that was cool. He's no longer around, but I'm reminded in a wholesome way whenever I wear my shirt	episode_done:True
text:What Do You Wear With Strong Sentimental Value?	labels:I don't wear these everyday but:  1) Two Timex watches. I got them about 7 years ago. One rustic and casual, the other shiny and dressier. Been with me from when I was in school, moved up at work, and now back in school. Also got them around the time I started dating my girlfriend. I am always wearing one or the other.   2) Pair of Clarks x British Millerain boots that have been with me all across North America, from coast to coast. Eight years now.	episode_done:True

text:What Do You Wear With Strong Sentimental Value?	labels:I have a real basic Pulsar watch that my wife bought me because I lost a similar Pulsar watch that had been my Grandpa's. I imagine watches are actually probably one of the more common sentimental items.  Also used to have a hoodie that I'd had since 7th grade (so \~18 years), that got lost while moving just this year. It was from being on the swimming team and it was perfect. It also had the extra sentimental value of being a time in my life that I ended up meeting my, too this day, best friends. It still fit because it had most likely stretched out with me over the years and was fairly sheer in comparison to most sweatshirts. I run hot so it was great when a t-shirt was a little too chilly, but a sweatshirt was too hot. .  I also used to have another zip-up hoodie years ago that was a similar story that had just been one of my go-to items for like a decade . So more like a safety blanket than any particularly sentimental memories.	episode_done:True

It’s actually the only ball cap I own, and it’s my go to for early morning classes when i don’t want to do my hair.

text:The Perspective of Medieval Menswear	labels:A few notes in regards to medieval clothing: Tabards were worn by a large mixture of people, but it is more of a coat (and yes, knights later on wore them over armour, there were also surcoats etc). What definitely was worn by all peasants was a tunic, worn over a shirt and braies (basically boxer shorts). Hose (leggings) were tied to the braies and were usually both brightly coloured and a different colour for each leg. There are more elaborate ones with multiple colours per leg, but that was for richer people. Over time tunics got shorter and braies became longer, until they became breeches. Crakows are a particular type of pointy shoe popular in the 15th century, the more general name is turnshoe, so named because they were made inside out, and then turned. In regards to Philip wearing black, interestingly this change was initially spearheaded more by the middle class. Previous black dyes were a more browny black, but in the 14th century a deeper black dye was developed and so many of the city-dwelling middle class (hence bourgeoisie) started wearing black, both as a sign of wealth at being able to afford this new dye and also because of certain other expensive colours being restricted. The nobility and royalty of Europe began picking this up soon after.

I also love how Moncler is pretty selective with who they collaborate with, and on that note, I’m weary of the route Arcteryx (one of my favorite brand for outdoor wear) is going with their recent collaboration with Palace. My fear is they diverge away from their outdoor focus and become another The North Face. But there is still hope - there’s apparently a Jil Sander x Arcteryx in the works.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:When is a garment worth it to you?	labels:For most reasonably priced items, my rule is (unless there an urgent sale) to wait ~3-4 weeks.

text:Grad/Masters Fashion Program Reality?	labels:Grad school is usually not worth it unless there is a very specific thing you want to do that requires it. There are many more people with advanced degrees than positions to be filled.
text:Well there would be, id be using my undergrad in fashion design to then hone my skills in said field. Was thinking FIT, Parsons, CSM, Antwerp for grad? Or even just an associates.  But I’m kinda caught at like is finishing these 3 semesters and then going on to grad school worth it. Or should I just drop it all and go to great fashion program at a fashion school.	labels:As I said, only worth it if you want a job where you have to have a graduate degree. Honing skills isn’t a good reason. You can get paid to do that
text:You don’t need an advanced degree to work in Fashion, but you definitely need a degree. Nobody in NY at least is going to look twice at you unless you come from Parsons, FIT, RISD or Pratt ideally, or a well-regarded program within another school.   I’d say finish your current degree and then maybe take some classes to be sure that actual fashion design is something you want to do. Design is a lot more than making clothes. It’s insanely hard work as a career. That said, there are a lot of great opportunities in fashion, especially in New York, where I’ve spent my 20+ year career.   FIT has great post-grad classes and associates programs too. Maybe you could work in fashion marketing while studying design? The combination of some design classes and solid marketing experience could very well lead to something interesting. Good luck!	labels:I’m actually currently differed from FIT, so I could just go there and do that.   Is that what your implying?
text:Yeah, or take classes while you’re working. I’ve taken several continuing ed classes there and it’s always been great. I’m saying take a little time before you enroll in another full time program.   Also, it quite normal for students at Pratt/RISD/Parsons to attend and get another bachelor’s. At RISD, where I got my BFA I actually think it’s a better education than a Master’s.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Grad/Masters Fashion Program Reality?	labels:If your goal is to start your own brand or become a fashion designer, or work in the fashion industry on the design and creative side, a marketing degree is an order of magnitude more valuable than a fashion design degree (granted, it should ideally be from a fashion school or a highly respected school). Everyone and their born-rich roommate in NYC has a fashion design degree just because they're interested in fashion and didn't know what to study in uni. In these industries with oversupply of graduates (who are willing to work for less than you), your goal should be to be significantly more valuable than your competitors. Having a marketing double major is one way, though it's also not very uncommon and you will still have significant competition.
text:Well see that’s my issue, I’m going to a general California State College Not an Art College. So even though I’m getting these doubles majors they’re not from a “good name school”.  I’m just at a crossroads, either I can grind out this double major (1.5 years) at my state school  Or transfer right away to PRATT or FIT, directly for fashion. But I’d have to go for 3-4 years.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:My goal is genuinely just get enough knowledge to work in clothing design. I have a pretty solid brand made thst ive been working on.  But a brand isnt my “goal” it’s more to get enough knowledge and experience to work in clothing and then maybe down the road do that.	labels:You don't need to go to FIT to work in clothing design. But the kind of company you want to work for will determine what kind of school you want to go into. Not because that school necessarily produces better graduates, but because school name and personal connections matter more than skills in that particular industry.   If you want to work for a designer or designer brand, then yes the best way to get there is to get into a reputable fashion school, make connections, and hope for the best. However, if you want to work for fashion brands that are still really good but considered more mid level (especially brands without a "designer" at the helm) then you don't need to go to a high fashion school; you need work experience and a good portfolio.   Your two choices have very different paths to your goal. If you complete your double major, you can begin your career working for smaller brands or larger fashion conglomerates to build your portfolio over a few years. Then, you aim for a well respected mid level brand like an Acne or Our Legacy to establish yourself in the field, and if you're good enough, take a step up to work for a designer.   If you switch schools for fashion design, then you're going to have to try and meet the right people, make the right friends, and produce work that will get people's attention (I cannot stress enough how deeply nepotism runs in these types of industries). If you're lucky (part of the 0.1%), you can graduate with a job at a designer house waiting for you. If you're not lucky, well, you start at a small brand of larger fashion conglomerate with a bigger student loan and fewer meaningful skills. High risk, high reward.   So, it really depends. Do you only want to work for a designer, and nowhere else? Are you willing to spend years building up to your dream job? Do you have a once in a decade talent for fashion design, or do you have grit and determination?
text:Wow, this is such a good answer.   Thank you   I enjoy high end and have a massive knowledge of it. But working immediately in high end isn’t really my goal. I wanna get a great education, be stimulated , be pushed, I wanna put all my time a nd energy into fashion. It’s all I think about, all I do, all I want.  My father is ironically a fine artist, that’s how we live as a family, Off his art. I’ve grown up knowing the work, dedication and talent you have to have even to even make a living off fashion.   It’s taken me a long time to realize how much I want this, but I’m 21 and it’s all I can think about.  If you wanna check some of my work my Instagram is @liepkes. Dm me tell me what you think.	labels:A lot of people live and breathe fashion and say it's all the think about. One of the downsides of an industry that is also a hobby for many, is that there is no shortage of people who desperately want to work in it. That means that: 1.) there is an oversupply of applicants; 2.) it can be a race to the bottom just to get in (unpaid internships, low wages); and 3.) your passion is not enough to get by.   Good luck on your future, and always remember that a job is still a job. And sometimes, it's worse when it's also your hobby.   If your dad is the first result for Liepke then I actually follow him on IG and really admire his art.
text:YES Wow, small world, that is my dad Malcolm Liepke I’m his son! So wild you know him. Saying I look up to my dad is an understatement. I’m very lucky to have grown up with such a unique outlook on the arts.  Thank you for the kind words, If I choose the Pratt path I knows it big gamble. I’ll have to live with the decision I make, I’m leaning towards Pratt but it’d gonna be hard convincing my parents.	labels:I agree with u/Reactionaire that a marketing degree is extremely valuable. I also agree that fashion is a field with no shortage of talented people. If you want to do actual apparel design, sketching, building concepts, technical design, etc I don’t see how you’re getting in the door without a degree unless you have an EXCEPTIONAL portfolio, even at at ‘mid-range’ brand whatever that is. Even FIT grads with exceptional portfolios have a tough time finding a job.   As someone who has worked in fashion in New York for over 20 years and hired for countless entry level positions, take it from me: you have to do the work.
text:Oh yes totally, I definitely need a degree in it. Never Said anything about that. In addition the work has to be put in is definitely massive I understand that.  My question more should I tough it out for 1.5 years at my state university and double major in Marketing/fashion design.  Or  Go to PRATT in nyc and do purely fashion but have to go 3-4 years again.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Grad/Masters Fashion Program Reality?	labels:Are you actually getting two bachelors by double majoring?  If so then stay the course and finish your degrees. Two bachelors will give you options in both fields and certainly make you a better candidate for a job. If not, then I’d consider taking the two year hit to do what you really want, I didn’t do that and spent my 20s flopping around in different fields.  Best of luck to you!
text:Yes, I’d be getting 2 bachelors!  it’d be a lot of work, but I would have both marketing and fashion design. I think it’s a smart move to get both.  It was Covid at the time when I had to make a transfer decision and it just felt weird starting 4 years all over again. especially while being online. I only have 3 semesters left and thought double majoring then going to grad would be a good compromise.   But I don’t know if it’d just be too late by then.	labels:I would stay the course and get two. I’m in my masters now for a field I should’ve been in a decade ago
text:So you think putting my head down for 1.5 years and getting the Marketing and Fashion Bachelors. Then move onto a grad/MA in fashion design would be more with it?	labels:Oh yes certainly, although I would talk to your advisors and see if grad school is even necessary. I worked in digital marketing (not fashion) with a BS in Psychology and no one cared about masters at my agency.  I started my masters this summer and in two weeks I’ll be over the halfway mark to graduation. A year is nothing and a year and a half is a little more than nothing ;) You’re still so young, I really wouldn’t worry about it!
text:Interesting, I’m just worried that my current school won’t give me enough to go right in to fashion being that they’re a California State school.   I was hoping a masters or even associates from a my focused fashion college could really solidify my skills.	labels:Oh I see, well definitely talk to your academic advisor before deciding on your own to invest in another degree, they can help you make an informed decision. It might just be a matter of taking a few extra courses instead of a whole degree.	episode_done:True

text:[Review] TATRAS OFFICIAL BORGOGNONE DOWN JACKET, down for the city	labels:Wow. I learned a new and interesting brand for me:) The style of this parka is a bit like a mix of M-51, n3b. At least some details are similar! It looks quite modern and technologically advanced, but at the same time it is not a purely utilitarian "jacket of a polar station worker"   In general, I am impressed by the oversized style. I saw something like this in Nanamica lookbooks  By the way, what kind of sneakers are you wearing?	episode_done:True

text:Koio Capri 2 Year review	labels:aside from the sizing, which i think is kinda weird, im glad you posted this review. some pics of how theyre doing now would be swell but this was a good review.  the sizing thing gets me though. they already seem to take in to account that you should take a half size down from your eu size. i'm a 12us/46eu in most sneakers. i get a 45(or us equivalent) in italian made leather sneakers (cp achilles, greats royale, balenciaga arena, oliver cabell low 1, gucci ace, etc) because thats a size down. thats always been ok for me. good to hear that there are other alternatives to common projects, which are stupidly overpriced btw. youre definitely paying the markup for the name

text:What is your favorite clothing purchase of the year, and why?	labels:If I'm honest, with this year being what it was, the purchase I'm most excited about is four pairs of slim-fitting fleece joggers from Gap. A close second would be two pairs of decent-looking New Balance 574s.  I've been working from home since March and really only go out to get groceries, get a haircut, and occasionally go for a walk on a nearby biking trail. My uniform for the last few months has been joggers and a polo shirt, sometimes an Oxford. It's just enough that I still feel professional at work (I do video calls with clients), but it's the most comfortable I've ever been at work.  When I have to leave, throw those New Balance sneakers on. Cold? Grad a denim jacket. Had I worn this outfit somewhere nice a year or two ago, yeah, I can see that being a cause for ridicule. But now, I'm frequently the best dressed person I run across when I go outside. At work, some people dress a bit better, but it's still comparable.  I look forward to seeing what happens to fashion when we get this pandemic taken care of. Some people have been putting effort together to make things like joggers and sneakers work and look great, I wonder if fashion in general will adopt more of the comfortable trends.	episode_done:True
text:What is your favorite clothing purchase of the year, and why?	labels:My 2019-2020 Tweed Jacket. I bought it in the spring of 2020, it was cheap as Uniqlo was phasing out its 2019-2020 autumn/winter collection. I spent only 2000 yen on it  I use it almost every day for work in fall.   I'm glad I got one from the 2019-2020 and not the new 2020-21 line.  This year's one doesn't stretch as well and feels uncomfortable.  &#x200B;  I only wish I could have bought another color from the 2019-20 so I'd have more variation  I guess when I get something that fits well, feels comfortable, and cheap to buy.. I get really happy about the purchase.	episode_done:True
text:What is your favorite clothing purchase of the year, and why?	labels:I bought a Seiko Flightmaster SNA-411 watch early in the Summer and have been really enjoying it. It's very different from other watches I have, busy-looking dial, but fun to look at.   In case watches don't count as clothes, my second favorite is a Barbour Sapper jacket, which I found in the Spring at a very good price. I've gotten a lot of use out of it. It's warm and dry, good pockets, and looks nice.	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 05, 2020	labels:Curious to see the opinions here.  How would you modify wanting to dress the way you want in a forever-hot and humid country, like the Philippines?  I know MFA (and other fashion boards) say to get stuff like shorts-above-the-knee, lightweight linen pants, short sleeve button downs, versatile shoes, etc.  But say, if you're enamored by something like the Japanese Americana workwear aesthetic, or something like techwear, or even something like legitimate vintage clothing/workwear. How do you dress like that here in the PH? I'm so interested by the possibilities of fashion but it's so frustrating not being able to put heavier fabrics on to experiment, lest I die of heat stroke.   To make it worse, I'm one of those people who is "allergic" to sweat and heat (I get really itchy), so ugh.

text:General Discussion - December 05, 2020	labels:I've gotten to the point that my printmaking and embroidery work are my "part time job", in that it can pay some bills and give me spending money, and allow me to live off of less work for other people.   Typically, i do repair work on people's clothing or sell paper prints and things like installation pieces and back patches, since I never got very far making art to hang up on gallery walls (I have sold a single-digit number of pieces that hung up in a gallery, but orders of magnitude more prints online or in a table show! WTF!)  Recently I'm trying something a little new- getting old, worn out, and/or vintage garments and doing all kinds of overdyes, sashiko, embroidery and quilting to them, mostly by hand. Then I plan to auction off or make a catalogue of these pieces as one-offs to buy. One of the pieces is a 1980s japanese denim kimono that i'm sashiko stitching in the traditional patterned styles, and I'm loving how it's coming out- but it still is scary to put so much time and thread into something that has no garuntee or obligation to sell at all... it feels much riskier somehow, even though all art is risky.

text:A work shirt will generally have two chest pockets and be lighter weight in a fabric like chambray, or a lighter flannel/twill.   Overshirts and shirt jackets will tend to have flapped chest pockets and maybe hip pockets and be a little heavier - maybe moleskin or corduroy or heavier flannel.   A chore jacket will be heavier again - wool or heavy twill or canvas maybe, and classically have two patch hip pockets and an external patch chest pocket and an internal chest pocket. Chore jackets will normally be cut much boxier too, and will have plain instead of button cuffs.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Why Ralph Lauren Never Goes Out of Style	labels:I f***ing love old Ralph Lauren. I eat that stuff up. I agree that the quality is part of why it never goes out of style. But also Ralph Lauren is still huge and relevant today, so vintage pieces feel both en vogue and archival, a very "intellectual" take on an American classic. Like an old Herman Miller chair. It was cool then and it's cool now. And RL has infiltrated all sorts of cultures, namely hip hop and streetwear meaning the demand for it isn't just bankers. And RL has been a titan of American fashion in that he sort of figured out his formulas a while ago and hasn't changed that much. RL from the past is just as recognizable as RL from today. In my opinion it's aged unbelievably well. Old RL pieces are like darling Americana that can styled with anything. An old RL knit hangs just as well with streetwear as it does with jeans and boots. And while similar brands like BB are nice, they are one trick ponies. RL has and continues to offer an expansive product line from tech skiwear to western clothes. I think this huge line up means that even if there are duds, they are hidden by the massive catalog of hit pieces like the bear line up.
text:I think at its best, RL pulls from all the great American heritage brands:   * Prep outdoors brands like Ll Bean or Woolrich * American Trad like Brooks Bros * Western brands like Pendleton or Levi’s   And finds a way to blend them and tweak them in such correct but interesting ways.

As a hiker I just carry a light waterproof jacket, but if your not going to layer up, either stay dry, get waterproof, or go synthetic  It's also with noting that I'm an idiot who didn't read the stuff op quoted where it says exactly this	episode_done:True
text:Down Jackets	labels:My top parkas are the Down Montagne Parka by Crescent Down Works and Battenwear’s Batten Down Parka. I’ve also owned a Canada Goose Langford and a North Face 800 fill goretex parka but they didn’t even compare.	episode_done:True
text:Down Jackets	labels:Damn I've always loved the look of those Cabourn Everest Parkas.  Also love the look of a Kara Koram Parka.  Eddie Bauer had a great re-release of their iconic skyliner which rides the line well as a down-y bomber.	episode_done:True
text:Down Jackets	labels:Worked for a luxury goods store and got a Canada goose parka that was returned at maybe 25% original price. A lot of people hating here but really incredibly warm and versatile. I don’t read too much into the status thing as in reality I’m a broke college student, but overall I really like the quality. I think the fur can be a little tacky so mine doesn’t have it.	episode_done:True

text:Down Jackets	labels:Maybe not the MOST stylish brand for some but, I've really liked my Feathered Friends Eos down jacket. I mostly use it for winters in Montana where it can reliably be in the negatives on my way to work. Couple mornings we were like second coldest on earth that night at -30F or so. But this thing is crazy warm and extremely light. It's 10.6 oz with 3.7 oz 900+ fill SUPER lofty Canadian down. Premium stuff. They also have other more robust expedition jackets and parkas. Again maybe more of a tech piece than a "flex on 'em" type jacket but I think it looks as good as any Patagonia down jacket. Also gotta add, these guys are the best in terms of their ethics and sustainable practices. They were one of the first adopters of the Responsible Down Standard which ensures the down isn't live plucked and is humanely sourced. And they are made in Seattle, WA (and Vancouver, B.C. now) since '72. Not a paid advertisement lol, just really dig these guys.  \*They also have bedding, pillows, and more famously sleeping bags that are top notch.	episode_done:True
text:My thoughts of the Cote&Ciel Isar L after a year	labels:I’ve owned the same exact model for some 6 years now. It holds up very well, although the issue with the shoulder strap slipping is annoying and has gotten worse.  Proudest moment was when a group of Japanese girls crowded behind me trying to figure out what brand it is.  When I still lugged a laptop and then some everywhere I was using it a lot. But  I’m not carrying as much anymore. I just need a tablet and a water bottle for which the Isar is overkill. It alone weighs more than both of these together.  So great bag with great design but specific use case. Smaller than your typical carryon but big for something to take everywhere.  What traveling I prefer a carryon plus a bag I that doubles as my daily carry, but the Isar is for me just a bit too heavy for this.	episode_done:True
text:My thoughts of the Cote&Ciel Isar L after a year	labels:Just want to chime in as another C&C Isar (I think mine is M, not L) user. Eco-yarn construction. Context: I'm in a doctoral program, live in another city, commute to campus when necessary. Pre-COVID, that was 2-3x/week. East Coast/New England, so a good amount of exposure to rain, snow, etc.   I bought mine circa 2014/15 in Copenhagen. It's been my go-to for pretty much everything since then. Everyday commute stuff fits very easily. As OP describes, space is massive, yet the construction of the backpack allows you to cinch everything down to a pretty small (if tall) package. I've used it for 2-3 day conference trips. The open duffel compartment really fits a lot. The more structured "backpack" compartment has cushioned dividers, pockets, etc. for flatter or more delicate/smaller objects.  Frankly, I love it and its one of the most interesting and functional backpacks I've ever come across. And the design, which variously recalls elements of modernist architecture, is pretty distinctive. My best experience with it was when I fit an absolutely massive doorstopper of an exhibition catalogue (600+pgs, oversized art book, hardcover) into the duffel compartment and it just...swallowed it up.	episode_done:True
text:My thoughts of the Cote&Ciel Isar L after a year	labels:I've lusted for this backpack since I saw it but then covid hit and it didn't make much sense getting a backpack when I shifted to WFH. Absolutely beautiful and theres nothing quite like it out there. This post might just have convinced me to pick one up lol.	episode_done:True
text:My thoughts of the Cote&Ciel Isar L after a year	labels:Have this in ecoyarn M and was my daily driver for about 2 years until covid hit. I like it for its intriguing look, but it's not the most practical of bags. It is quite heavy, and the damn shoulder strap adjusters always loosen up. It doesn't have a quick access pocket as well except for the secret one where I just put my coin purse for commuting.  It's more of a show-off/flex backpack imo. I got an Aer Fit Pack in X-pac for practicality but will most likely keep my Isar M.	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - December 02, 2020	labels:Thanks heaps to /u/dai_due' for selling me one of his Uniqlo +J hybrid down parka! finally received it and love it. Can't believe size XS actually works on me (normally medium in uniqlo stuff). Still has enough room to layer and somehow still has that oversized look. Amazed!  Also, after about 6 months of wear, I can confidently say the Auralee seamless tee is my favourite one that I own. I immediately knew it was gonna be my favourite as soon as I received it but I wanted to see how it was after many wears. One of the best features about it is that it's so soft but still drapes so nicely. And any wrinkle it develops after being folded in the closet basically straightens itself out after being worn for about 10 minutes. Shit! now i'm looking for more in different colors. A bit expensive at retail price but I've seen them on sale for around $50 which is doable for me.	episode_done:True

text:Red Fleece is fantastic and distinctly different from the main line. Skews younger and has better cut of jackets in my opinion. Most of their main line suits are padded, lined, and boxy. They’re good but the overall result is pretty conservative, even with lighter fabrics and fits. It’s good stuff off the rack for sure, just not terribly flattering.

text:General Discussion - December 01, 2020	labels:Some of the best ring sizing advice I've seen from Alicia Hannah Naomi:  > You are strongly encouraged to check your ring size carefully before placing your order.Ring sizing is not an exact science. Tools and techniques used to read and take sizes can vary from jeweller to jeweller, but being sized professionally by an experienced assistant at a reputable jewellery store is always the most accurate way to determine your ring size. Using string or paper to work out your circumference size is often unreliable.  >Make sure to factor in which hand you want to wear the ring on, and the temperature the day you are fitted as this can affect your size. Check that space between the base of the finger and the knuckle is wide enough to accommodate how tall the ring measures. Personal comfort is also a factor, but ideally, a ring should need a hard wiggle to get over the knuckle - too easy and you may risk it falling off, too much resistance and you may not get it back over the knuckle again.   >The heavier and wider a ring is, the larger the size you will typically need to wear. You may need to add one or two full UK sizes to your usual ring size when choosing a heavy and wide ring. An experienced jewellery store assistant should be able to advise you whilst you are being measured.

Had I known how much trouble it would be to break into watches, I might have said never mind and wisely walked away. I didn’t, though.   Some pointers for those interested:  1.	The cost of the watch is only the upfront cost. Like a car, a mechanical watch needs regular maintenance. Generally speaking, this will be anywhere from $300 to $1,000+...every 5-7 years.  2.	Because of point #1, entry level (~ $500) mechanical watches are not pieces you will pass down to your kids. In fact, it is usually cheaper to trash them entirely and buy new than to bother having them serviced.  3.	People will tell you there are deals to be had in the vintage market. That’s true, but it can also be difficult to find parts or people willing to work on them. 4.	There is relatively little offered between entry level and about $3,000.  5.	There is nothing wrong with wearing a quartz or digital watch.   All that being said, I still love my small collection. Just wish I had known those things from the start.

text:All great points!   What always got to me was that the "good" stuff always cost money.  It was like tailoring in that sense, where say Ring Jacket and Drake's clearly has a different aesthetic than H&M or J. Crew, but you just need to have the income to support it. And then of course for me, I'd rather have a nice jacket/shirt/etc than one watch.  Then there are vintage watches and swatches which are affordable and quirky, so it worked out at least for now. And I agree: nothing wrong with digital or quartz.  Hopefully others see your comment and they can also start collecting!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:I'm Not a Watch Guy I Swear - Street x Sprezza	labels:I could not agree more about 36-38mm watches. I've always worn watches, inexpensive ones but I've always put one on first thing in the morning and worn it until I'm getting in bed at night--even if I'm doing nothing beyond sitting around the house all day. My small collection was all 40mm or 42mm.  A couple of years back I decided I wanted to take a slight step up from my $125 Orient automatics. I purchased a 42mm Hamilton Khaki Field and it just didn't feel right. I loved the aesthetic of it but I couldn't pinpoint what was wrong so I reluctantly returned it a few days later.    Fast forward to this summer and I couldn't get the Khaki Field out of my head. I read more about it, mainly forum posts, and read a good conversation--I can't recall on which forum--about the 42 vs the 38. I read enough to be coaxed into trying the 38. I remember opening the box and thinking, "this is SO tiny. It looks like a toy." One poster said to expect that reaction and wear the watch for a week and you'd come around on its size. Man, was he right. With 7.5" wrists I absolutely love 38mm watches. I ditched my older Timex Chrono Weekender (40) for a classic Weekender (38). My Orient Bambinos (40) now feel too large even though I thought they were too small when I bought them several years back. Every time I wear them I look at my wrist and wish the watch was smaller. Every time I see a character in a movie or show wearing a watch I think to myself about how bad and how huge the watch looks.  As for price, I also agree that most expensive watches are too busy or simply don't appeal to me. Even if I was loaded I wouldn't buy luxury watches.  A quick thought on wearing a watch in the smartphone era, at least in my profession, I sneak a glance at my watch during meetings or at times when it's not appropriate to pull out my phone.	episode_done:True

Like, damn dude maybe if you think menswear is so boring you should stop wearing things other than grey sweatshirts and darkwash jeans every day, like, there’s so much incredibly interesting stuff in menswear, “menswear is boring” is really babies first take, go wear some Dries dude  Edit: I know I’ve commented on this before but I’m also pretty firmly of the opinion that any “tricks” to make you look taller are so well known that you’re probably more likely to have someone notice those than a long coat	labels:> I know I’ve commented on this before but I’m also pretty firmly of the opinion that any “tricks” to make you look taller are so well known that you’re probably more likely to have someone notice those than a long coat  Plus those tricks only work (if at all) when taking photos without something else in the image for scale.  Once you go outside and stand next to someone taller than you, these tricks are meaningless so ultimately they're a waste of time.  To paraphrase wuz (I think)...

I'm guessing because my job, while outdoors half the time, is not particularly labor-intensive.   I'm just wondering if there's any method of kind of breaking it in, so to speak. Should I wash it (as per the instructions on the inner tag), maybe? I'm worried that might prematurely fade it, or worse, cause it to shrink the way hoodies sometimes can even if you wash on cold and air dry.	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - November 29, 2020	labels:Just finished Legend of Korra and it was really good. The first season was good, the second was meh, but seasons 3 and 4 were fantastic. I went into it super skeptical but I think it was a worthy successor to Avatar, although I don't think anything can top that show (it was the only TV series I followed as a kid and I've rewatched it a ton since).
text:I liked it and I think the art style and music match the pace well, however, my only two problems were:  * not nearly as relaxing and soothing as Avatar. Avatar has really nice nature connections that are kinda lost in the city setting The filler episodes in Avatar are relaxing and nice looks into either the nature of bending/human-nature relationships or the friendships/personalities of the characters.   * Korra never learns anything. Aang learned how to solve problems without using his powers and Korra just hits stuff until it’s fixed. Aang had to grapple with his moral code constantly. Korra just gets the major issue of the end of the first season solved for her with out doing anything. It seemed like an interesting dilemma for her character and she gets out of it with out changing at all or even a hint of self reflection. Plus her villains are all way more interesting and actually have some nuance and personality.	labels:Yeah, I do think that they really missed out on developing most of the characters. Very few of them had an arc similar to Zuko, Sokka, or Katara. They went with more characters with less development, which is just a different approach IMO. I do think she really doesn't show much growth in S1 and S2, which is one of my main complaints. She consistently loses in fights and never really seems to change anything. I also could have used like 100X more meetings with Aang, I think Aang had more time with Roku than Korra had with Aang.	episode_done:True

text:I like it precisely because it looks slightly unfinished or unconsidered. Harry Styles has a really intense stylist and it’s vogue, there is absolutely no chance that these outfits were not considered to death by a bunch of really knowledgeable people.   He is definitely not meant to look pretty, and to me that’s part of the point. He’s just ... wearing a dress. It doesn’t even really look feminine per se, which I guess is what you’re reacting too. I think the point was really to not associate the dress with femininity, but to just treat it as another piece of clothing. That’s kind of how he deals with his sexuality: he studiously avoids making any statements whatsoever.   I think the place that I see something historical is not in the dress but in the fact that it’s a vogue cover. I don’t know if this was a one time thing or if vogue is going to now be more gender diverse with their cover models. To me that’s the question: is the point that he is a feminine man or rather that Vogue can set these categories aside on one of their covers, which is a really culturally significant object.  This made waves precisely because it was a Vogue cover. He has worn dresses before without this reaction. But it doesn’t clarify vogue’s position on gender really. My sense is that to they will occasionally feature male-identified models on their cover, and just generally observe more fluid norms around gender. In a way Harry is just the tool for Vogue to make a big move within their own history, maybe...	labels:Thanks for that response. I can totally see how my angle was gendered. I was projecting my personal aesthetic and not considering the greater statement. I’m glad it resonates with you both symbolically and in the visual presentation. I love conversations like this.
text:Yeah I like conversations like this too. I can suddenly see how it would just like weird and uninteresting if you had pretty clear gender categories. I feel more in the mix like he seems to, so it definitely does resonate with me. I think the thread below is interesting too, that it’s because he was seen as a hot male celebrity in One Direction and has gradually wound up wearing a dress on the cover of Vogue. I am not actually a super radical gender person, but there is something about Harry Styles that resonates extremely strongly with me. I frankly can’t say why.  The ppl in the other thread are emphasizing how there’s nothing inherently new about what he is doing but I disagree. I think he represents a very widely-consumable version of a gender queering position. He is at once legible as a British rock star and something very contemporary. It comes back to the sense of insouciance. I know everything he is doing is deliberate, but his attitude is that none of it should matter. I think other instances of celebrity gender bending were framed as being subversive, whereas he is trying to treat us as precisely not subversive but nothing. It’s a complicated move, for his radical thing to be to pretend that what he is doing isn’t radical. But for me it works and is quite smart and meaningful (even if it is, as the ppl in the other thread are saying, a series of calculated decisions, I don’t think it’s only that. I think he is following something genuine and internal, even if he is a professional concerned with having a successful career. He does strike me as being actually genuine in a sort of rare way. Idk. This was a long response, which shows how intensely his dress thing is impacting me.	labels:I’m glad you feel safe to express yourself here. I like what you had to say. I work to live without gender categories and I definitely projected just some of my aesthetic choices. I go for polished looks that are “complete” from head to toe so my first reaction was “needs some makeup”. But you’ve pointed out it’s more of a dejection of all that instead of just putting together a feminine look.   I wanna pose a question to you. Do you like Harry as the subject for something like this over someone like Billy Porter? Why or why not?

text:My theory on why Harry is this: playing with gender in fashion isn't new as you pointed out, eternal icons like Grace Jones have been there and done that. However, Harry's instance is unique because we have seen in a highly publicized way the evolution of how he sees his gender. He started as a (sorry fans) generic white musician with bland style and has since sort of aggressively redone his look. I'm sure he's been called "brave" in numerous articles documenting his steps towards this moment. Similar pretty boys like Ansel Elgort and even people like Post Malone have played with gender, but none in an as aggressively pursued and marketed way as Harry did. I also think people see that he has an X-factor because of his sexual identity. Billy Porter being a publicly queer person is sort of expected to do these things. Yeah his gown moment was highly publicized but it certainly didn't "break the internet" and spawn discussion like this did.  edit: also exactly what u/Anthraxistaken said	labels:I was thinking that too about how it was all because we've seen his growth and I couldn't have summed it up better.	episode_done:True

text:Just how revolutionary is Harry Styles’ Vogue cover?	labels:Women look better in dresses.  You can be as progressive and woke as you want, and encourage whatever you want so people can express themselves, but aesthetics dont care about that stuff. Womens clothing is typically styled to cater to the female (sex) body. People always comment on the dress itself, or whether it works, but never how that same outfit would just look better on a female.  This is a matter of aesthetic and taste to some extent, and thinking that men generally look bad in dresses is a justified opinion.
text:This seems like an incomplete comment to me for a couple of reasons.  First, the argument that women look better in dresses isn't particularly useful, because that same reasoning could be applied to everyone, but just in this way; 'a more attractive person would look better in this' the comment doesn't isn't actually talking about this person in this piece of clothing.  Second, I think a big flaw around this is that women tend to look better in dresses because women have had thousands of years of aesthetic development to make dresses look good on them. I think that this dress itself conveys that quite well, the collar of this dress looks out of place to me and I think that is because the dress is held back by that idea that a dress is for women, and the design language and cut's haven't developed around men so much.  In particular, the style of ball gowns in particular which this dress effectively is, fall into that much harder than another type of dress might, more casual shirt-dresses that button down the front that can repurpose some of the aesthetic of mens shirts etc and would make the transition over to being worn by men with less of this friction.	labels:[INVALID]	episode_done:True

They are, don't wear them unless you *really* know your shit. Like, "studies runway shows like an academic" level of knowing your shit.

text:Are jean shorts on men really that bad?	labels:I’ve seen them cycle in and out of style a couple times in my life. Like a lot of things, when they’re on-trend it’s relatively easier to style them, when they’re not it’s a higher degree of difficulty. To a lot of Americans they summon up associations with certain groups of unfashionable men (like stereotypes of hicks or rednecks), gay men (esp. if they’re short), and/or are a punch line (ala Tobias Fünke). Undercurrents of classism and homophobia in some of that, unfortunately. So when you wear them, some of the reaction you’ll get will depend on how you play either against or into all that.

text:Guys who lost a lot of weight, how did you change your style?	labels:Congrats mate  I used to be obese as fuck like 35 BMI but now im at 20 BMI.  If you plan on keep losing weight, the key is to buy used clothes that fit slightly tight so that they start fitting better as you go on. You can minimize the cost doing that	episode_done:True
text:Guys who lost a lot of weight, how did you change your style?	labels:First off congrats on not moping around and leveraging 2020 in a positive way.  Your style will keep evolving but a few suggestions from having made this journey.  1.  Get your workwear wired.  Not sure of your dress code but if you are biz cas go basic bastard and pick up some cheap j crew type of stuff.  Not to much but enjoy some 484s, you've earned it.  This will tide you over professionally.   2.  Start exploring. The best way to do this is look a lot of places for inspo but keep your lens wide.  It's a wide world out there.  3.  Start picking up a few pieces here or there.  Vintage and thrifting are your friends.  Try different things.  Some will stick, some won't.  But by getting it cheap you can experiment at a discount.  4.  Think about how you can accessorize and leverage what you have.  Simple things can raise your level (but don't do them all at once).  Throw on a cardi or blazer over your biz cas.  Buy a pocket square or two.  Switch the laces in your shoes.  Have fun and congrats.	episode_done:True
text:Guys who lost a lot of weight, how did you change your style?	labels:I definitely changed my wardrobe up when I lost weight. I wore a lot of black, a lot of graphic tees, hoodies and straight cut jeans, basketball shorts, cargo shorts. I definitely am now in the “basic bastard” category of dress. No more black, but more subtle natural colors like dark green, navy, browns, etc. avoid sneakers and big logos but instead casual boots and such. Oh and everything slim fit, but obviously not ridiculously slim. Levi’s 511, J crew 484, etc. I definitely experimented when I was dropping weight and still had to dress business casual. But yeah don’t overthink.	episode_done:True
text:Guys who lost a lot of weight, how did you change your style?	labels:Congratulations on the healthy transition.   First, don’t buy a new wardrobe all at once. Have fun buying a shirt or pair of pants in your new sizes but your body might still be changing shape and your taste and confidence in clothing with it. Vintage is a good way to go if this is your first time really branching out into fashion.  Second, don’t overcorrect for slim fits. Mercifully the super skinny fits trend is over and I wouldn’t be too self-conscious about not having muscles. I’m tall and slim, but a too-right shirt can still look like a sausage casing.

It sounds like you have gone from chubby to skinny but you are about to put on more muscle. I wouldn't go super-slim if you're still gymming and putting on muscle. I basically went from  medium to a small then back to a medium from putting on muscle.  I probably would hold off on investing in more rigid pieces like jeans for a bit, but if you work out a lot I would invest in better gym clothes (i.e. Nike Tech Pack is something I really like), and get nice stretchy clothes that can accomodate your physique like cardigans. I would also invest in a good fleece (i.e. Patagonia or North Face). Essentially anything that you imagine stretches a bit and is something you wear every day, I would get nicer versions of. T-shirts should not be a big investment and I would just get from Uniqlo for slightly oversized from any brand really.  I think pants are a bigger question mark and for now it would help to go with an elastic waistband or wear something inexpensive that you can experiement with (i.e. Uniqlo, Levis, Unbranded, J. Crew if on sale). Honestly I don't really wear either much these days and don't recommend buying them if you're expecting to be at home for the majority of the time, as you'll want things that you wear a lot (IMO).  If you provide your height and weight I'm happy to provide my input there too. I went from \~170ish to \~150ish at 5'8" a few years ago, then put on muscle, then am back to being a fatass so will be making a similar transition over the next few weeks.	episode_done:True
text:Guys who lost a lot of weight, how did you change your style?	labels:Congratulations, man! I cannot express how much better I feel now that I’ve dropped weight; I’m sure you feel the same way.   I really just turned what was normal normal fit and maybe a half-size big to more of a tailored look and the actual, correct size.   I’ve also felt more confident which has led to slightly different looks. I’ve always been a little more of a conservative dresser but now I’m incorporating a few more styles into the wardrobe. Really nothing major but a few tweaks that I really love.   Side note: it is super frustrating that tailored clothes look off as soon as you lose weight. I had to completely rebuild my formal wardrobe.	episode_done:True
text:Guys who lost a lot of weight, how did you change your style?	labels:I lost 3 stone, sold all my clothes, bought all new ones, then got fat again.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 28, 2020	labels:Trying to determine a length for a leather jacket, which most likely will be sent out to schott for the alterations. I can't find any tailors near me that primarily or largely work in leather, which bring me to measuring for myself. Calling anyone, they all play it "safe" and say it's up to the person"s choice, and that's great if they have a great sense of fashion. Recommendations I keep seeing online is for the sleeve to be at the bend of the wrist or 1/4" longer. If this is wrong, please let me know!  So if I have my arm hanging naturally to my side, I see 3 possibly for the bend of the wrist. 1. If my hand is hanging naturally to my side, then the bend is where my wrist and hand meets at the side of the pinky (side facing towards my back)  2.same above, but thumb side (side facing towards my front)  3. If I were to bend my hand upwards (as if I was doing a push up), the bend being the 90 deg bend made by the top of my hand to my wrist.  Reason asking because all 3 appears different, where option 1 would result in the longest sleeve length and option 3 being the shortest sleeve length.  Or option 4, measure to a different part of my hand	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - November 28, 2020	labels:There's a part of me that wants to lean into "Small business Saturday" and buy something from Etsy or wherever, but damn, they don't make it easy. It's such a wasteland of drop-shipped Alibaba products, cheap crafts (like Gildan tees that have been tie-dyed or bleached and then upsold for $50), and just straight up scams (i.e. polyester being marketed as wool), finding actual stores by actual craftspeople seems a total crapshoot. I know they must exist because I know actual craftspeople who sell through Etsy but unfortunately they seem like the minority. I wonder if anybody has ever made like a Chrome extension or something to cross reference Etsy with Alibaba/Aliexpress to at least filter the shameless "I'm even reselling using Aliexpress's same photography" 1:1 matches.
text:This is the same problem I have with eBay. I'm sure they have exactly what I want _somewhere_ but digging through all the mislabeled or fake crap is exhausting and not worth it.

text:FAQ: What are people's experiences with clothing challenges like trying not to buy clothes for a year/only buying second hand? What are some tips?	labels:I haven’t made myself any rigorous challenges, but i have tried to be more mindful about purchases.  In my opinion, a bit of self awareness goes along way.  If i am thinking about an item i write it down on my wishlist. I dont buy anything that hasn’t been on that wishlist. If I come across something online, even if it is a flash sale, just put it in the cart, on the wishlist, and chill. I come back to the list periodically, and see what i still want, what i still think about, and what ive either forgotten or don’t really want anymore. The time waiting on that list should be directly related to the price.  Don’t succumb to the FOMO. For me, not filling my life with extra stuff i might not actually want is far better than missing out on a deal. If i only thought about it because of the sale, i can afford to wait for the next sale.   This has been effective for me. There are plenty of things that I would probably enjoy, but most often, after thinking it out over time, it’s clear that I wouldn’t enjoy them significantly more than things I already have. If i had implemented this technique from the start of my clothes interest, I estimate id be about $2-3k richer now. The only thing i can think of now which ive consistently been interested in for a few years would be some guidi boots, but honestly those are too far out of my price range to make happen	episode_done:True
text:FAQ: What are people's experiences with clothing challenges like trying not to buy clothes for a year/only buying second hand? What are some tips?	labels:I try my best to only buy during sales and when I buy it's under two circumstances. The first if I need something that I don't have that are absolute necessaties such as work pants, or to update a particular item if a similar item is found that offers the same benefits if not more e.g. old, thinning bomber jacket vs insulated bomber jacket.  I haven't bought any new casual button downs or dress shirts in a year since I'm satisfied with my current collection and most likely it'll be the same for the upcoming year.  For shoes,  I live in an area that's notorious for its weather so I take extra precaution on wearing the proper footwear to and from work or the gym inorder to extend the life of the shoes. Annual cleaning and maintenance is necessary.  Note: It helps to wear items for their intended purposes. I  wear jeans at times but I don't go camping or hiking in them, nor do I wear them when it's exceptionally hot or humid. I have an interest in raw denim and have heard stories of people wearing their raws for everything in order to get fades. I don't do that. Same thing applies to welted boots.	episode_done:True

'Perfect tee' threads are usually highly-upvoted, but the answers have drawn from the same pool for the last goddamn decade:  - *Vintage/workwear (generally heavier, boxier, shorter):* 3sixteen, Buzz Rickson's, Lady White Co. - *Streetwear (generally lighter, slimmer, longer):* Reigning Champ, wings + horns, John Elliott - *"Normal" (somewhere in the middle)*: Naked & Famous, Arket, American Apparel when they still existed - *Edgy goth shit:* Rick Owens mainline for lighter and DRKSHDW for heavier, Kazuyuki Kumagai Attachment, Voidthebrand when they still existed - *Budget*: Muji, Uniqlo, Everlane, Bella+Canvas, etc., but no one really cares  It's functionally a solved question. You can pick one from the applicable list for your style, and it'll be *fine.*

I realized when that calamari dude was wearing the fisherman sweater, it struck me as being out of place. I love how most of the robes and things seem very interesting, but also lived in and functional. Everyone just wears whatever they want or whatever suits their lifestyle, and no one else pays it much mind. Dude walking around in shiny battle armor? Sure, I’ll just mind my own business  Also the cinematography of todays episode was dope. Amazing vibes and colors (clearly in debt to old samurai films )	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 26, 2020	labels:I've always heard "match your leathers and metals". But it's honestly pretty hard to match all of your leather and metal items perfectly. I often have items in varying shades. Is it a big faux pas to mix leather colors or is it not a big deal? (E.g. natural colored leather accessories while wearing dark brown leather shoes)
text:Matching  metals is not a thing,  except in men’s tailoring where you match your belt buckle, to your cufflinks, to your tiebar. It doesn’t apply to jewelry or watches both of which come in two-tone varieties,  making it impossible to match in those circumstances.   Matching leather is a little more nuanced.  With men’s tailoring you should match your shoes and belt pretty close. Same with the upper levels of business casual say blazer and/or tie. It also doesn’t apply to watch straps or accessories  Anything below that level, getting it approximate is close enough. I like to match brown to  brown but don’t worry about the shade all that much.  if I’m wearing oxblood shoes I wear a brown belt.   For actual casual outfits; jeans and iron rangers or streetwear etc,  it doesn’t matter at all	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Winter jackets that are good for skiing and casual use?	labels:Dont go crazy on a jacket.  The key for skiing is layers and you can get a lot of layers that work well in other settings.   A decent base layer:  you can go merino or if you are on a budget milsurp poly pro.  A fleece over that.  Next layer is a beefier jacket.  Right now I have a half zip Patagonia that is poly insulated.  Then get a waterproof(ish) layer.  You have a lot of options but I usually run with a marmot precip.  It's cheap, has pit zips and folds up way smaller than a hard shell. That combo will cover you skiing 90%of the time and let you adjust depending o N conditions. Flexibility is the key.  Take the money you save and get some good socks and gloves/mittens and some type of balaclava.  No one ever came off of the mountain because their chest was cold but it was their hands/feet/face.
text:Yep, I'm pretty sure the lightest and least insulated jacket I own is my snowboard jacket. It's just there for wind and waterproofing, not for warmth. Plus because it's supposed to be worn with many layers it doesn't fit right without said layers, so it's not very useful as a casual jacket.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:This is the right advice. I've been a ski racer for many years. Most of the best jackets like Arc'teryx, HH, etc will prioritize their shells with all the nice features like Recco, pit zips, pass pockets, goggle cleaners etc. Shells are excellent for cutting through wind and then you can have more or less layers depending on the temperature for insulation.   My current setup is an under armour (Costco has great ones from a brand called 32 degrees or something like that), a Hot Chilis quarter zip, a vest that I got as a gift from Marker, and a patagonia poly fill that I swap out for down if it's cold all under my shell. If I'm in a GS suit it's mostly just the under armour and then two coats because it's a bitch to carry layers around as you have to shed them to race.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Do you have a concept of "Par Value" in menswear?	labels:From a logical perspective, it makes a lot of sense and this system would work for most people. I think everyone naturally has a different idea of what "on par" means to them given their budget and taste and there's a saying that the value of a piece is what the buyer is willing to pay for it. Sometimes there will be those pieces that just speak to you regardless of the price and while those are a rarity, I would like to see that incorporated into this system. This is more true when you start going up the scale where fashion becomes more of an art form instead of "clothes". For me, I would pay $1000 for a Craig Green jacket because I love his work and it speaks to me on a deeper level like a '97 Honda NSX would; to me the experience is worth the money. While the numbers are important, to match your golf analogy, it's still a game to have fun.
text:Absolutely this. While quality is something I think about, especially when going into the triple or quadruple digit price range, it isn’t always my guiding factor. Plain black tee? Yeah sure I’m going for par quality. I’ve never understood people who need a Margiela plain black tee. But I do understand people who want Margiela tabi boots. I’m sure you can get boots that out quality Margielas for half the price. But they won’t ignite that flame and if I’m not ignited by a statement piece them I’m not having fun.   I guess this whole discussion will just be people fighting for *how* and *why* they dress. Some people want solid brown boots to last 20 years. Others want boots that make them feel a certain way or say a certain specific fashion statement. Regardless we’re all one fashion fam. :)	labels:	episode_done:True

So, if I tell myself, yeah, $400 for a piece of outerwear with features a, b, c is fair, but this $600 piece really speaks to me, I might go for it, but if it's $1800, fuck that, I could probably just get it made, or get something else that speaks to me just as much for cheaper.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Do you have a concept of "Par Value" in menswear?	labels:How are you determining quality? I'd wager a lot of less experienced people (particularly those who haven't actually spent money on higher end things) don't always have a good frame of reference on quality. It's easy to parrot what you hear on reddit or in a youtube video, but do you (general you) know what you're looking at when you're making that assessment of quality?    For example, a canvassed suit simply has a feature (non-glued material floating within the body) that you like and attribute a stamp of quality to, but that doesn't mean it was done well or that it's a quality garment. It may be \*more likely\* that is it, but does not necessitate it. It's easy to assume something is overpriced, especially when you're a neophyte. Additionally, there's a lot of the blind leading the blind going on here and in other fashion communities (and other hobbies/etc).     "Value" is a nebulous term, and people seem to be desperate for a way to mathematically determine if they're making the best/most optimal choice. It's a fool's errand. You're better off pursuing pieces that actually make you happy. You will wear them more and enjoy them more, thereby generating the only "value" that matters.
text:>How are you determining quality?  I'm not, really. I'm kidn of just extrapolating data I have from others, and patterns I see -- oh, bemberg lining tends to come in on the higher-end half-canvassed suits. Oh, they named their wool mill, that's good.  Value and quality are nebulous terms. You wanna know a secret? So is everything else in every language normal people use to communicate. We still use them, form coherent thoughs based on them, and live our lives.  I'm not trying to pretend I have an equation that tells me whether a purchase is good or bad. I just have a lens.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Do you have a concept of "Par Value" in menswear?	labels:No offense intended OP, it’s your money and you should spend it how you choose, but I never want to think of clothing this way

text:Do you have a concept of "Par Value" in menswear?	labels:There's too many metrics of "value" (or 'worth') for a 1 dimensional metric like Par to be useful. You'll spend all your time arguing over how to determine the Par for a type of clothing, and nobody will be wrong.
text:I'm not arguing over it at all, though, I'm just using it as a lens. I focus on quality details, and then tell myself, oh, okay, I'm paying an extra 30% for syling? Or oh, this isn't exactly what I had in mind, but it's 80% cheaper than it should be? Hmmm...  There are a ton of factors left to consider, and I make each decision on a case-by-case basis. I'm not trying to calculate anything. But I find this lens very helpful.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Do you have a concept of "Par Value" in menswear?	labels:Hmmm ... Yes, but ...  I look at clothing as a cost-over-time  So an £80 pair of shoes that will last £8-10 years is 'par' because that's what I'm used to - a £300 pair that lasts 20 years is 50% over par at least  Likewise I have a £2 T-shirt from Primark that hasn't shrunk, pilled, nor gotten baggy after 5+ years - no other T-shirt is going to come close to that setting for par  People say you should buy 'quality' clothes that will last decades, but a £20 or £50 T-shirt will be just as ruined as the £2 one by a tear or stain, so buying 'over par' clothes can be financially ridiculous

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 23, 2020	labels:I'd like to expand my knowledge about 90s fashion, brands, and styles. Particularly the way Jerry Seinfeld dressed on his show.   I would like to be pointed in the right direction on:  1. Brands of this style (jackets, shirts, bottoms, etc.) 2. Fit for men of this style 3. any other resources!  &#x200B;  Thanks!
text:I was just watching a bunch of Seinfeld episodes with my kids and took some mental notes on Jerry’s style. He kind of has a uniform consisting of a baggy OCBD (often in unusual bold or pastel colors) tucked into slim-fitting jeans. The current oversized trend doesn’t really replicate what Jerry is doing with his shirt fits, as his button-down is generally too big all around — his shoulder seams often extend well past his natural shoulder and his pit-to-pit is a full 4 inches or larger than his natural chest. Check out the J. Crew 1994 line, which uses patterns from around that time period and can capture that billowy silhouette. The jeans are probably just Levi’s.  For outerwear, LL Bean and Eddie Bauer capture the vaguely outdoorsy casual vibes he usually gives off, things like barn coats and parkas. You never see him in a sleek wool topcoat.  When Jerry is performing, he’s usually in a loose-fitting sportcoat with big shoulder pads — your best bet there would be to look at vintage Gucci from the 90s on the secondhand sites.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:But I feel like unlike runway fashion, concept cars are more appealing to the masses, even if they ultimately can't afford them.	labels:That’s why I like the comparison.   Clothes have a practical use. They keep you warm and dry and protect you from the elements. They also have a social use. The way you dress tells other people how you want to be interacted with. They also have an expressive use. Your orange jacket is your favorite color, the Metallica patch on your vest is there to remind you of the concert where you met your wife.  In the same way cars have a practical use. They are a conveyance to move people and things. They have a social use. A fancy new Mercedes or a well maintained classic jaguar e type tells others where you are in the hierarchy. They also have an expressive quality. Color, form, decals, tinted windows, spinner donk rims, etc.   And in both cases you’ll see where there the style portion of the item needs to be balanced against the practical and social portions. A Lamborghini Aventador is dripping in style but you can’t move furniture with it. But it still functions as a car. You can still drive it on a public highway. It still has airbags and an engine and runs on pump gas.   High fashion, like concept cars, can be completely devoid of practicality. You can see clothes warped to the point where you question how the person even walks upright wearing their outfit. Sometimes they can’t. Concept cars can be so oddly proportioned that they cant fit an engine or drivetrain. Sometimes they don’t even have working doors on hinges. But that’s the point. It’s to turn the expression and social interaction values to maximum without having to compromise with practicality.	episode_done:True

text:What work for my boyfriends taste and body type?	labels:Photos and a budget would help.  Layering can be good, especially for a guy with a broad frame like you're describing.  If he wants more Americana, he can try westernwear (denim, flannel shirts, chambray shirts in the summer, rugged leathers). Flannels can be worn open over a tee shirt as a very casual midlayer, or buttoned up as you might expect.  On the smarter end, he might be interested in Ivy / Prep. That will include oxford cloth shirts with button down collars (a "university stripe" in blue is a good start), tassel loafers (a Brooks Brothers original), khaki chinos (overrated), and a navy blazer.  I can give more specific recommendations if you give us an idea of your budget.	episode_done:True
text:What work for my boyfriends taste and body type?	labels:My husband has a very similar body type. When he got a new job recently in a larger city after working from home for years we basically went out and got him a whole new but fairly minimal wardrobe that’s worked out really well for him.  We picked out a color palette for him which is mostly blues/navy, gray and olive green. He had a couple of basic button downs like a plain white and a crosshatch pattern in various shades of blue. We picked him up a few more button downs in various classic colors like white, light blue, white with a simple pattern of any of those colors. We also got him a couple of more casual button downs, either because of fabric or a louder pattern for fridays or casual wear. J Crew button downs ended up fitting him well. I agree with other recommendations for slim fit jeans and chinos; we replaced his light wash Levi’s 501s with dark wash slim fit Levi’s 511s and those look great. Banana Republic’s traveler pants are also a favorite for him, fit and good stretch but look sharp.   For outer wear we got a couple of basics: a grey fleece vest like from Patagonia for the “midtown uniform” look; it’s more comfortable than wearing a blazer but still looks more formal than a button down on its own. I also got him a quarter zip navy merino wool sweater to layer over his dress shirts on colder days. More casually he has a lined flannel “coat” that he wears over a basic white tee, a more tech jacket, and formally I found him a basic black wool overcoat for work.   For shoes we got him one pair of nice oxfords, one pair of oxford looking tennis shoes from Cole Haan, a pair of off-white leather shoes as his dressier items.   He also has hiking pants and brown hiking shoes that he wears as casual clothing with sweatshirt tees or flannel.	episode_done:True
text:What work for my boyfriends taste and body type?	labels:I have a very similar build and I have found that a pair of well fitting tapered jeans has really upped my wardrobe substantially. It makes my regular t shirts or sweatshirts look way more put together.  Edit: pair his current t shirt with some well fitting jeans and a open cardigan for a great casual but smart look. It’s been my go to lately; it looks great but it’s also super comfortable and easy to throw together.	episode_done:True
text:What work for my boyfriends taste and body type?	labels:Here’s the irony, you want slim fit pants, in a dark colour, with a good sweatshirt. Try bonobos black jeans in skin or tailored, with a shawl neck jumper. Get a good pair of Chelsea boots. A turn up at the bottom of the pants will help elongate the legs	episode_done:True

text:What work for my boyfriends taste and body type?	labels:Consider directing him here, he'll know his preferences better than you. I'd recommend the Basic Bastard in the sidebar, his problems aren't all that unique and most of his questions have probably already been answered in the sidebar.  >He’s got cold undertones and a lot of ruddiness, with ashy hair. So I have a rough idea of what colours look good on him.   Yeah I say don't even think about this. It's very limiting, and considering how little skin menswear shows it doesn't matter at all even if he looks a bit washed out. The clothes take up like 10x more space than his face and hands, which  means that in my opinion the main thing should be matching THEIR colours.	episode_done:True

text:What work for my boyfriends taste and body type?	labels:I have found the best way to hide my dad-bod tummy features that I’m self conscious of is through layering. This is very weather specific, but one of my go to options is a t-shirt, an open flannel, then a denim jacket. You can smarten it up with a nicer shirt buttoned up.   Another strategy I really like when I’m trying new things that I’m not quite comfortable with is to wear it out for an hour or so (like go get coffee, walk in a park, or something like that where you aren’t too social but still in public) then go home and put on clothes more in my comfort zone. I have found this slowly builds my confidence bit by bit and allows my to trial run things for what works and what doesn’t.   Playing into the braid shoulders might be a good idea as well. That’s something typically masculine that looks good. Trying suspenders instead of a belt (or just not tightening the belt too much, so as not to accentuate the belly again) is a good option. Where long sleeves either rolled or pushed up can make upper arms look bigger too. I like a Henley style shirt this way as the cut is very masculine there.  Find pictures, have them on your phone while shopping to try to find inexpensive alternatives.
text:I think layering will make him a lot more confident to try new things. I feel so bad for him with his insecurities. He sees his belly as really big when it’s not it’s just not flat like a models. And he always wants to cover it.   I think he does need to slowly build his confidence up. Just a bit at a time like you said. And Henley shirts looks like they’ll really suit him! He’s never rolled up god sleazes but he’s got very good arms that he could really show off.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - November 21, 2020	labels:Hey fellow adults I can’t eat meals without spilling myself even tho I’m an adult who is an adult. What tips do you have for an adult who’s a messy eater despite being an adult?   Just curious if there are any other adults out there who struggle getting food from their plates to their mouth without using a baby’s bib?
text:What shocked me is all the people relating to the poster in the comments, and the lone person all the way at the bottom telling to learn how to eat. Well, and also him not realizing why people eat over their food instead of over their shirt. Lol.	labels:The only real advice in that thread. The concept that he can’t go without spilling food on himself is insane
text:I can’t even remember the last time I spilled food on myself. I get maybe one tiny splash stain when I eat at a ramen/pho restaurant 1/4th of the time. I always feel like a fucking maniac when people are like “HOW DO YOU FEEL CONFIDENT EATING SPAGHETTI WHILE WEARING A WHITE SHIRT I SPILL MARINARA ALL OVER MYSELF EVERY TIME I EAT HA HA HA” and get a bunch of upvotes. How do you get through life without learning how to chew with your mouth closed and eat over a plate without dropping food on yourself?????	labels:[INVALID]	episode_done:True

text:Streetwear From Above — Die, Workwear!	labels:> wide-boys   History really does repeat itself huh?   Edit: Interesting article. It’s definitely weird being conscious enough to watch stuff from artsy/DIY/underground scenes “trickle up” into being trends. Not trying to be too “I saw it before it was cool” or anything but it’s wild watching “skate fashion” get super popular and now thrift type stuff. That’s just how we dressed out of necessity, now everybody’s rocking the vans/adidas/converse with dickies and Carhartt stuff my homies and I would wear cause it didn’t tear so easily when skating/causing trouble. Anyways it’s late and I’m rambling and this article was thought provoking. Thanks.

Also, weird to me that people still rag on Vetements' shtick; after half a decade, I'm frankly cool with their output though it's borderline cliche now

I'm sure that's not what anyone wants to hear, but I don't see this as markedly different than a child who has to learn to put away their toys. Messy eating isn't some genetic anomaly, you can simply exercise more control over how you eat. It may even be as simple as slowing down or leaning forward more over a table/desk.
text:I don’t think this is fair. There are a lot of people out there that have real struggles you’re not considering.   I have ADHD and I have difficulties with executive functioning. My ADHD brain sees there is food in front of me so my singular focus becomes shoveling that food down my gullet. When you start adding “distractions” like talking to my partner or unconscious distractions like filtering out restaurant noise, it’s difficult to focus on staying neat. Like many others with ADHD, I’m also clumsy without a clear cause.  Consider physical handicaps. Someone with tremors will have difficulty with spills. Same with someone in a wheelchair when a restaurant isn’t properly ADA accessible. They can dress they way they, but they might need some accommodations or they might need to employee some extra life-hacks.   I’m not trying to be dramatic or suggest you’re a bad person or anything.  Well-meaning people forget about the everyday struggles of others all the time. OP asked for practical advice for a problem they’re having. Many others, including me, reading this thread have real anxieties from the same issue. If the solution was as simple as trying harder, everyone would have done that already.	labels:Has no one in this thread heard of napkins?      They are typically placed on the table next to or under utensils. And you're welcome to use them even when eating with your hands.

text:True. Habits can be hard to change though. I think some are more important to prioritize over others. These days I am more focused on health. But I should try slowing down since that aligns well with better health. Leaning into the table seems like maybe like a suboptimal solution that could lead to bad posture. But who knows...  I'm curious. You've never spilled anything on yourself?  So far I frankly just expect it to happen sometimes.  Most clothes and most of my shirts are fairly inexpensive. Even my sweaters.  But recently I did start to upgrade my wardrobe.. still, wouldn't be the end of the world to replace if even necessary.  But I was still curious what other people did & I am happy to read everyone's take	labels:>You've never spilled anything on yourself?  Of course I have, but not with any frequency that it's something I think about. If I had to venture a guess, I'd put it at maybe 3 times a year? I dunno, it just doesn't feel like it's something that takes a lot of work to improve.
text:I get your perspective. We all have our own strengths and weaknesses & things we choose to focus on. Some of them are silly.  &#x200B;  I don't think it matters that much.   &#x200B;  But I'd rather keep a spare white shirt around if possible like someone already mentioned instead of leaning into the table when I eat. But to each their own. Or just get my clothes dirty... it may happen anyway.	labels:Admittedly messier-eater-than-I'd-like, here too. I'm in the same boat - I've been more conscientious of not letting oil splatter while cooking, being more careful while eating, etc. I have become better at this, but to OP's point, it's easier said that done to change a habit you've carried for decades.	episode_done:True
text:Messy eaters? Tell your stories and hacks / fixes.	labels:A friend of mine always had a replacement shirt in his car. One night he managed to get both stained.

text:Messy eaters? Tell your stories and hacks / fixes.	labels:I live alone and during this year have largely been working from home. My go to, unironically, is I just take my shirt off altogether.

I rarely spill anything on myself but I don't need to worry about it if I do.	episode_done:True
text:Messy eaters? Tell your stories and hacks / fixes.	labels:well alot of stains can be mitigated if you deal with it immediately.  for the most part, simply just rubbing a big of soap and water on the stain area immediately after the spill should make it come out quite easily.	episode_done:True

Good news is that I only buy 3 or 4 new items a year as stuff wears out (gets more holes than I can patch). Occasionally I can get stuff second hand or thrifted which is nice. In the scheme of things clothing doesn't work out that expensive, my helmet is over 600, chaps 200, other gear I wear 200, chainsaw 3000.	episode_done:True
text:What is the breakdown of $ spent for various outfits you actually wear?	labels:Maybe £100-300 for the whole outfit. More so £300 at this time of the year I'd guess.  Most expensive things are jacket and shoes which make up about 3/4 of the price for me.  Shoes I always buy new and expensive cause my feet suck. So £50-150.  Jackets are second most expensive and I try to always buy second hand. Got a few Barbour's and vintage coats for £10-50.  Jeans/trousers are a pain to buy second hand because the fit is normally crap. Maybe £50.  The rest is all second hand. Jumpers/shirts/t shirts. Can easily find that all super cheap on eBay, depop or in thrift stores.  Or my full suit which is £300 including tailoring. SO used to work in a suit shop and got discount on that one.

Background: I have been wearing Jack Purcells as my go to sneaker for the last 7-8 years or so and have probably gone through 5 pairs. I love the way they look but I have wider feet (particularly the midfoot) and they’re pretty narrow. I size up but still manage to almost completely blow out the outside edges within a few months. The foxing breaks down super quickly for me and all of a sudden the sidewall is almost parallel to the floor. I used to do the same thing to Vans Authentics in high school.   I’m used to it but I know (and can feel) it’s not good for my feet. Trying to avoid needing to ditch the Converse style if there’s an alternative out there.	episode_done:True

text:Indochino VS Local custom clothier (HM Cole). My fair review.	labels:I would agree with the overall sentiment to get an OTR suit and tailor but I will also add, in my own opinion, to avoid Indochino whenever possible.    I purchased a suit from them that was really bad because it was too small.    Then they sent a recut that was too large.  Both had arms set at different angles by a few degrees leading to weird darts of fabric showing up on the back and the chest.  One sleeve, out of the four, was wavy all the way down instead of a straight line with a bend at the elbow.  I'm not even sure how it was possible.    Then they sent ANOTHER recut that was again too small.    My local tailor I took it to said there was little chance of salvaging any of them, given the level of complexity it would require to do so.  Not a simple pinch-tuck-hem situation.  This process took over two months and when I got tired of the shot gun attempts they were sending me, I asked for a refund and they refused.  Even though their claim is  *"Every INDOCHINO purchase is backed by our Fit Promise. If your order does not meet expectations, let us know and we will make it right."* their customer service rep told me *"Yes, using alterations or a remake to get the right fit. There is no mention of refunds, as this is not something we offer."*  Once you drop $500 on a suit, you're stuck with it.  Even if they made it so poorly, the tailor tells you they can't do anything.  Today I'm down $500 on a wonky suit that I never wore and will likely end up giving to Goodwill.  I'd strongly advise everyone to look elsewhere and just avoid the hassle altogether. It's a gamble that's not worth it.
text:Good insight. Agreed wholeheartedly simply based on their return policy and customer service.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Indochino VS Local custom clothier (HM Cole). My fair review.	labels:Indochino is only decent if you live in a city with a showroom. It's better if you live in a city with a "flagship" showroom. I've been to the showrooms in Calgary and Ottawa and they can't do measurements nor alterations. Vancouver, one of their "flagship" showroom, is amazing.
text:Wow that’s a big surprise. Would be very interested to check out their flagship showrooms. Have you compared to suit supply? Seems similar but a step up in price would be curious to hear how their showrooms compare.	labels:The decor of the Downtown Vancouver location is not that nice since it is one of their earlier ones, but I found the tailors and staff to be much more knowledgeable than the ones at other location. Their alterations, measurements, and customer service is amazing.   I haven't been to a Suit Supply but one is opening up next year so I'm excited!	episode_done:True
text:Indochino VS Local custom clothier (HM Cole). My fair review.	labels:I live in an area with a few indo stores near me. I have one suit and one blazer made by them.   I have a very V tapered build with a 12-14" drop so literally nothing OTR fits me or will fit me.   I was measured there and had a few after alterations by them and the result is fine.  For the $$ it's good value.  However, I want a high quality closet and find it absolutely worthwhile to spend the extra $$ for SS - Full Canvas MTM. The fit on my SS suits and materials just feel a world ahead of Indo.

text:Do you guys default to a set of a few pieces even though you own a ton?	labels:Yeah. I definitely have a set of clothes that get worn every week or multiple times every week. Things like dark slim-straight jeans, Indy boots, Patagonia baggies, some flannels, Barbour jackets, grey crew neck sweatshirt etc. I think it’s totally natural to gravitate towards a set of specific items as the “core” of your wardrobe and in general it’s worth spending more money on those piece. And then the rest of my stuff gets worn way less frequently. That stuff kind of fits into two categories in my mind: 1. Items that fill the same niche in my wardrobe as another item which I prefer either due to fit, style or details.  2. Items that are unique in style, color, or fit and thus only work in a narrow range of situations / outfits.   For me, the difficulty is avoiding items that fall into that first category and instead looking for more interesting stuff that would fall into the second	episode_done:True
text:Do you guys default to a set of a few pieces even though you own a ton?	labels:Definitely. I think it's natural, depending on how much work from home you're doing, and what the dress code is at work is where you spend a lot of the time.  Regardless, owning a piece I love, sitting in my wardrobe, gives me joy. There comes a stage where that joy turns to sadness when I realize I haven't worn it for a year, and that's when I move it on. However most of the stuff I have I get some wear out of, and keeps the joy going. It's just a little bit more difficult with a toddler and wfh life.	episode_done:True
text:Do you guys default to a set of a few pieces even though you own a ton?	labels:yeah absolutely. i have a fairly small wardrobe (i counted and i have i think… 33 pieces total), but i've noticed that as it grows, there are definitely pieces that i reach for more often. i think you can use that information sometimes to figure out what you want. there are some things that i try not to wear much because i discovered that they don't resonate with me.  as for worrying about ruining nice stuff, i bought a deveaux cashmere sweater recently and remember that i was a little antsy about wearing it at first. then i realized: it'd be a shame if i spent all that money not to wear it, even if i paid nowhere near retail. as cool as i think some of the clothes i own are, i'm buying nice clothes to wear them, not to collect them!  if it helps, whenever i buy a new piece of clothing, i usually make a point to wear it as much as possible—even if it's just at home—until it's not a 'nice thing' to me, it's just another shirt or pair of pants that i own. maybe you can ease into wearing your nicer things by just spending a bit of time wearing them in the house?	episode_done:True

text:Do you guys default to a set of a few pieces even though you own a ton?	labels:yeah. i think once i figure out which 'default' items I tend to reach for.. i end up getting rid of the infrequent stuff, and buy more colors of the default thing.   lately im defaulting to turtleneck sweaters most of the time in cold weather... so I plan to buy 2 more colors.  probably get rid of the polo neck sweater or the long sleeve henleys.	episode_done:True
text:Do you guys default to a set of a few pieces even though you own a ton?	labels:Yup.  I've talked about this in multiple replies to these posts before (not that I'm able to find them right now because argh Reddit search noooo), but the gist is I have a bunch of items I routinely wear and a bunch of items I don't.  Now the clincher for me is that stuff I don't regularly wear, I sell.  I'm hitting that point where I'm going to sell off a bunch of stuff because I haven't put it on in 9 months and I don't want to sit on unworn things.  As far as "nicer" vs "less nice" goes - I've never let that stop me.  If I'm buying something, I better damn well wear it, whether it's $10 or $100 or $1000.

Tried them on and I have to use a shoe horn to get them on and could not wear them sockless only with socks. Not sure if it's cause I need to go a size up to a 9 or get 8 1/2 wide or stick with the ones I got and maybe they just need to be broken in. I still feel a lot of room between my toe and end of the shoe though, the heel is the only part that rubs once I put it on and walk in it, it feels a lil tight top to down wise too kinda like a glove like feeling. I attached some pictures of the fit, my toe hits at that rounded lip line near the end so about .75 of an inch or so of space so I don't think going a size up would help. What do you all think?

Not by your fits, not by your hobbies or skills or jobs or what you do for others, but *just by being you*.  I know lots of guys who wear butt-ugly shoes, suits that don't fit right, mismatched patterns and textures, etc. A few of those guys are my best friends because they are good people regardless of how they dress.

text:We’re in a post fashion world everything is in, looser fits have been very popular the last several years, you don’t have to wear them just to be on trend.  General advice is balancing out proportions, instead of wear one oversized item with a bunch of skinny stuff try to pair oversized tops to with looser pants and chunky footwear, I think layering helps to make the width look more intentional as well, and make sure things still fit you correctly(ie, don’t just buy things too large for you) you can expect stuff like slightly dropped shoulders or longer hemlines are oversized clothing but make sure it still falls relatively close to what you want, and have pants that are hemmed to not be pooling around your shoes, most people here prefer cropped cuts for looser pants but a half break or so is fine as well.	labels:that’s really helpful thank you	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 17, 2020	labels:Thoughts on whether slim-fit navy chinos overlap too much with dark non-distressed jeans in a similar fit, for casual wear? I picked up the chinos from UNIQLO because they were on sale and fit well, but honestly I don't see myself reaching for them over my dark denim for casual war. For business casual and above (i.e., wearing a tucked-in button down shirt), I already have trousers/slacks in similar colors that I would wear instead of the chinos, so maybe they are a solution without a problem.
text:Strictly for casual purposes, I agree that there's a lot of overlap between the navy chinos and the dark denim, assuming they both have a similar cut and are both a similar shade of navy. However, I think the chinos can still lend themselves to a somewhat less casual look (even though the overall outfit is still casual) - for example, a polo and navy chinos has a different overall look than the same polo and jeans, even if the jeans are the same color and cut as the chinos. But not a dramatically different look.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Indian factory workers supplying major brands allege routine exploitation	labels:The crux of the article (and exploitation in general):  > #'Brands are to blame' >  > These kinds of brands do not own or operate factories in India, which creates distance between them and working conditions there, but one owner of a clothing supplier - who did not want to be named - told the BBC that if brands push for cheaper clothes it can leave suppliers with no choice but to cut corners to meet orders. >  > "It's the brand who wants to maximize the profit. So, they push you to a level wherein you have to do the exploitation in order to survive," he said. >  > The owner, who used to supply a major UK brand not mentioned in this story, described some factory audit processes as a "sham". >  > "The factory is aware when the auditors are coming, so they keep everything in perfect condition before," he said. "The moment the audit is over, everything goes back to normal, which means exploitation and non compliance." >  > He said that poor checks and balances, combined with a lack of responsibility by the brands, makes it hard to stamp out that exploitation. >  > **"It is the way of working in the textile industry, it's just not India, it's everywhere."**

text:As Chanel Raises Prices For A Second Time this Year, What Do Luxury Brands’ Inflating Prices Mean for Them & for the Industry at Large?	labels:Luxury brands inflating prices means creating another pricepoint at higher categories.

The only way this can be curbed is through the consumers. When we stop falling into the hype cycle and scramble to buy up everything just for the gram and social media likes, these products will sit and go into the 50-60% off discount during the sale seasons. All these brands have data; when they see that stuff is sitting and mostly selling at lower price points, they'll need to curb their expectations and set price points accordingly.   It doesn't help right now during COVID that I see people whose jobs/income did not get affected by COVID, and therefore has additional disposable income because they aren't eating out, partying etc. They justify spending more on items at MSRP instead of waiting for a sale.

Surprised to read that essentially the whole block is owned by Norway's Sovereign Fund; hopefully this helps with some of the rent issues.   Hopefully they can pivot to other items like masks, RTW, etc. I think to fit the consumer's taste right now, they should also do stuff like custom fitted knitted tees and polos.

While this causes a whiplash that's kind of the point, it's far further outside the norm to see conventionally feminine gowns paired with a blazer. Is it bad or are we reacting instinctively to violated convention despite pretending on the outside to be aesthetically open minded.

text:FAQ: What are the different use cases of boat shoes, moccasins, driving shoes, and loafers?	labels:**Boat shoes**  \- On a boat, or trying to do more 'traditional' prep. No longer really worn by 'frats' in most of the country; they've all transitioned to sneakers.  \- Great for being out on the water when you don't care about them being wet. Never worn with socks.  **Moccasins**  \- more middle ground, depending on cut. Camp mocs have the same style purpose as boat shoes but are more practical away from water. I'll wear these to a bar, but never would with boat shoes because I'm no longer 19.  \-Blucher mocs to me are just 'casual' loafers  \- Proper moccasins are worn around the house  **Driving shoes**  \- driving, and not much else.  **Loafers**  \- most formal of the list. Can get you in and out of any situation, provided its not snowy; sloggy, or rainy. Going to look the best dressed up.- Here in the upper Midwest, I prefer a nice boot to loafers, but thats more 'modern' and can get looked down on by more traditionalists.     Also to add:   **Leather sneakers**   \- look great in more traditional colors and cuts (Tobacco, Black, Toffee etc)  \- are casual but a great idea if you dont want more formal shows	episode_done:True
text:FAQ: What are the different use cases of boat shoes, moccasins, driving shoes, and loafers?	labels:For me, the simplest distintiction would look at it in terms of the casual vs. formal.  Obvious with the name, boat shoes and driving shoes were originally designed for people who wanted stability/comfort when operating a boat or vehicle. But nowadays, boat shoes, moccasins, driving shoes are all meant for casual outfits when you don't want to wear sneakers. They can be worn with tees and jeans, casual button downs, chinos etc for just a regular night out or weekend errands.  Loafers on the other hand, have a large variety (ie. penny loafers, horsebit loafers, chunky lug sole loafers that are trendy right now, unlined Belgian loafers, etc) that they can go from casual to formal. I would even argue that velvet slippers that people match with tuxedos would fall into the loafers category too. The popular look this summer had been pairing Weejun loafers with Patagonia baggies for a more casual look but the loafers on the higher-end price points (Gucci loafers, John Lobb, Baudoin and Lange, etc) can easily be paired with suits and tuxedos.
text:To add on:  The formality of a loafer is (generally) determined by a few things:  Leather: Smooth leathers in darker colors are more formal. This is opposed to leathers with a visible grain, or with a nap (suede).   Stitching: If the stitching color contrasts with the leather, it's more casual.   Outsole: Lower profile, darker midsole with a dark welt finishing is more formal. A formal loafer will also have a raised heel, a flat heel is casual.   Styles: The more plain and sleek, the more formal. Beefrolls, bits, tassels, heel pinches, and other such flourishes are *generally* less formal. However this is sometimes a point of debate, and most people won't care or notice.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:FAQ: What are the different use cases of boat shoes, moccasins, driving shoes, and loafers?	labels:Boat shoes: Spring and summer when I’m wearing shorts and/or a short sleeve top  Penny loafers: Spring and summer when I’m wearing pants and something dressier on top like a polo or button down, or the occasion is just dressier  Blucher Mocs : year round when I’m wearing pants and going somewhere casual.	episode_done:True
text:FAQ: What are the different use cases of boat shoes, moccasins, driving shoes, and loafers?	labels:Been wearing driving loafers for about 10yrs. I'm 40, and a car enthusiast since my kindergarten days. I initially found some Puma driving shoes to wear. These were great, because I wear a 16 and the tighter cut of the shoe helped me just do things normally. Good feel for my pedal modulation too.  I needed something more professional for business casual dress at work however, and driving loafers were perfect. Steve Madden & Kenneth Cole got me started, and I've had some Cole Haan & Rockport as well. Different price points, but they've all been great.	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 14, 2020	labels:I’m looking to rebuild my wardrobe for 2021 starting with basics. I’m torn between Gap and Uniqlo. I find that the Gap in my city basically have the bare minimum - ocbd’s, polos, tshirts, jeans and chinos which makes shopping much easier; whereas Uniqlo has tons of varieties with their different pieces and takes time to figure out the difference. Gap is just a little bit more expensive but does this mean they’re much better quality too?
text:Most westerners seem to have a big preference for uniqlo. I've checked them out locally, and in multiple countries. Quality is consistent across the board and good for the price.   I would say both brands are about even in quality cause Gap is actually pretty good especially when on sale (my experience is limited to Gap Japan though). The T shirt fabrics for both brands are nice, but a bit thin if that matters (tropical weather here so these are a big plus for me). Uniqlo has great collabs though and some of the seasonal collab designs might appeal to you.   I think for the dress shirts and pants...youre probably gonna have to base your decision on price, fit, and design preferences. That's what I'd prioritize when choosing between budget-ish brands anyways.	labels:	episode_done:True

Return policy is 30 days, but you have to ship it back to the UK on your own dime.  It gets delivered 7 days later. Next day, END starts their seasonal sale and the wallet gets reduced by $70. Wallet is still in stock. I help her message support for a price adjustment, and they told her to shove it.   Regardless of whether she had already opened and used the wallet (she hadn't, because it's a gift...), she *could* place a new order at the lower price, wait less than a week for it to be delivered and ship the new one back on the first order for a full refund minus shipping.  We explained this to the reps and they said 'ok, you're free to do that.'  Nevermind that we'd be shipping the identical wallet across the world and then back for no fucking reason. Nevermind that we'd be out another $20+ for having to pay return shipping on a small item to the UK AND their shipping fee on the second order. I even asked if they could refund the adjustment amount minus the shipping. Nope.  Fuck END, fuck their policies. Support Mr. Porter or SSENSE instead.	labels:[INVALID]	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - November 12, 2020	labels:I ordered a new saddle for my bike.  Immediately after ordering, I saw a promotion for 15% off my first order.  I sent a request within 5 minutes for that promotion to be retroactively applied (processing change, price adjustment, partial refund, cancel and reorder, whatever), and they basically said "no".  Returns are free.  I am going to ship this goddamn thing back across the Atlantic and they are going to lose out more on shipping than they would have just giving me the discount, plus the cost of a sale.  EDIT: I should be naming and shaming, it's Brooks y'all.
text:The stat that 50% of all businesses fail within five years makes sense. It's these types of decisions that do it.	labels:They're not gonna fail, they've existed for over a hundred years and they're maybe _the_ most well known bike saddle company.  It doesn't make it less frustrating though.  If they weren't so big/old/popular, this would be a bigger business threat.

text:Casual Blazer Inspo	labels:I love blazers/fits like this. The framing  a lapel gives it almost forces your gaze inwards and the work wear connotations in most of these fits gives you license to go really rough on the textures which I also really enjoy seeing and wearing.   The paraboots and Chunky boots really help keep the rest of the outfit casual yet a little bit more formal than sneakers and I just enjoy the look of that footwear.   Having said all that fit 14 (I think lol) with the slim black jeans and Chelseas is prolly one of my favorite I love when the lapels stand like that it gives so much more structure/visual interest than if they are just lying flat	episode_done:True

I did however, make it to my local Uniqlo and managed to grab some of the pieces I couldn't get online.  &#x200B;  * White Light Down Volume Hooded Coat: Really nice and a lot thicker / more durable than I expected it to be. I have a black Veilance Down jacket which gets a ton of mileage so I'm not sure where this "fits" in my wardrobe.  * Black Merino Cardigan with the Cloud: Surprisingly love this. Looked a little strange / quirky online but actually has a nice drape, interesting hem and a nice contrast patch at the bottom of the buttons.  * Black Oversized Ribbed Blouson: Love the details on this piece (especially the sleeve ribbing). Definitely looks more expensive than your average Uniqlo piece. I got an M and it feels potentially a little TOO oversized. I have a Green S on the way as well so at least will be able to compare.  * Navy Double Faced Work Jacket: Looked boring online but I put it on and loved it. The fit is on point and the drape is amazing. Definitely on the expensive side as it is only 70% wool, but it's like a a nice modern & minimalistic work jacket which can be a little hard to find.	episode_done:True
text:NYT: Jil Sander is back, with a new Uniqlo collaboration and a lot of opinions.	labels:Here in Denmark a lot of stuff was sold out two hours after launch online. Went to the store though, and they had everything. I was in love with the oversized parka from pictures but once I actually tried it on, I got a bit disappointed with it. It was too long IMO and overall had that same slightly childish/adolescent look that I also think the original Uniqlo hybrid parka has. I think pairing the oversized silhouette with a slightly cropped length could have made all the difference and made it s sweet piece. But it honestly is not that different from the original. The turtleneck however is awesome. It's way wider than uniqlos usual sweaters so it fits amazing. Uniqlos standard turtleneck is stupid slim	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 11, 2020	labels:How do Artisan Lab Essential's profile compare to CP? Seems like side-by-side comparison photos for these are pretty hard to find.  I already have Greats Royale which is decidedly chunkier than CP, and I'm hoping to get a pair of white sneakers in slimmer profile similar to CP.  Kind of considering Beckett Simonon but I'd prefer having actual lace guards instead of BS's more minimal "holes on a plain sheet of leather" look. Also would prefer smoother looking leather than BS's leather with visible pores (not sure if they're pores, but similar texture to orange peel).  In the end, Artisan Lab seems the closest barring CP, although AL's heel part doesn't look as good as CP imo. I think that's worth sacrificing for a cheaper price, but if they're visibly chunkier than CPs, then I may as well just pay that CP premium (although I'm never paying full price lol)	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 10, 2020	labels:**Jamieson Shetland Sweaters**   I'm successively (re-) building my wardrobe around the themes of responsibility and (scandinavian) minimalism. That for me is: Few high quality items that are made ethically and sustainably and work well together to achieve the aforementioned aesthetic. Currently I'm in the market for a somewhat textured but simple grey wool crew-neck-sweater for fall and warmer winter days, preferably made in Europe. I have been looking at Harleys, Howlin, Sunspel and Jamieson's and have a tendency for the latter because of them as far as I know being actually made completely on the Shetland Isles. Now for my two questions:   1. Jamiesons's is the most affordable of these brands (which is not a priority for me but also does not hurt ofc). Do any of you have experience with their quality, longevity, fit etc.? How do they compare to the other brands?   2. Would you go for a light grey (their "Granite") or a medium-dark grey (their "slate") for maximum versatility in the context of scandinavian minimalism?   Thanks :) I'm quite new to the MFA community and enjoy it a lot!	episode_done:True

Having that kind of hyper-specialized obsession to be really great at niche sports especially doesn't align well with being a normal, well-adjusted person. She was telling me that in particular she was most in contention when she was like 13 or 14 and she basically had a coach tell her like, "If you want to have a shot at actually being an Olympic athlete, you need to have your parents pull you out of school and you can get a GED later, or otherwise move somewhere for you to go to an athletics magnet school. From there you're basically going to have to abandon all hobbies and interests for the next decade or more, because basically every waking hour is going to have to be spent working physically or mentally on your sport."	labels:>Having that kind of hyper-specialized obsession to be really great at niche sports especially doesn't align well with being a normal, well-adjusted person.

text:FAQ: How do I pick out my first suit for professional internships, interviews, etc.?	labels:I think that an under-discussed part of picking out a first suit for these types of things is getting out and trying them on before you buy. Being comfortable in a suit, even if it’s cheaper or in a less fashionable cut, is more important in interview settings than the eye to detail and quality that we normally discuss on here. A suit that fits in the shoulders, in a neutral color like navy or charcoal, that you know fits because you were able to try it on is way more important to your success than ordering something online that might be objectively better. Interviewers are looking for you to meet their minimum standard of professionalism, not for you to wow with with sartorial taste. Source: had a lot of interviews in college and law school.
text:This is super important. When people talk about "making sure a suit fits" they're usually talking about how it *looks*, rather than how it *feels*, but both are important.   One of my first "adult" suits was a really basic, cheap OTR suit I got when I was about 22. It technically fit my body and when I asked others for their opinions on the matter (including fashionable friends), they all agreed that it fit me well, and I looked good in it. There was always some nagging issue with it though that I could never put my finger on. I only realized after owning it a couple years that the pants rise was about an inch lower than the rise I wear on my jeans and chinos. It wasn't "low" mind you, again, it technically "fit" fine, but it's not the rise I'm used to and the rise I like the *feel* of on my body.  Some issues with "fit feel" can be fixed with tailoring, but others can't. If a rise is too high you can probably get it shortened- if it's too low, there's probably nothing you can do about it. Always worth keeping in mind that a little extra fabric can be reduced, but if something is pinching, pulling, or hugging you a little too close, you might have the wrong garment on.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Totally agree with your take. I had to wear a number of suits for professional events and interviews.   Make sure the suit fits and stick to charcoal and navy. Invest in making sure the clothes fit (aka. a tailor) and not overspend on the interview suit. Same with the shirt and tie; keep it neutral and unoffensive. Don't need loud patterns on the shirt or the tie. You're not there to peacock your fashion; be memorable through showing qualifications for the job.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:I completely agree with this. I would add that suits should always be fitted for you by a tailor. It can make a cheap suit look like a million dollars.  I would just add that you should also be aware of the level of formality at your workplace. I work in diplomacy and anything trendy is a no-no.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:FAQ: How do I pick out my first suit for professional internships, interviews, etc.?	labels:I think the advice for "what to wear for job interviews" has changed a *lot* since the sub started. Increasingly suits aren't even a good idea in a lot of industries and you'll be over dressed.  Further, the advice from before was often to get "one good suit" and to spend a lot of money at Suit Supply or similar.   I think for a lot of people, suits will be so infrequently needed that spending $400 on a suit is most likely over kill. Especially if you're a student and on a budget.  Read the guides on how a suit should fit, a lot of that hasn't changed too much. Then go somewhere where you can try the garments on in person (writing this for if/when COVID ends) and go from there. I find it weird to recommend to beginners to try and order a suit online without seeing how the garment fits on you first or spending more than around $200 if it's something you'll need maybe twice a year for the career fairs.  Get something in a basic navy or charcoal, brown dress shoes, a white dress shirt, and a basic grenadine tie to go with it. Easy.
text:Anecdote: I've gone to all of my job interviews wearing a t-shirt, jeans, and if it's "winter", a hoodie (and for most of them, flip-flops), and always gotten an offer. This is a) for software jobs in small companies in California and b) not what I recommend, really, but there are two points to it. The first is that you need to pay attention to your industry *and* locale *and* specific company. The second is that in general, I think it's better for someone to wear the clothes they are comfortable in as long as it's within an order or two of what's expected, rather than something that's "right" but further stresses them out in an already stressful situation; when you're relaxed you perform much better.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:FAQ: How do I pick out my first suit for professional internships, interviews, etc.?	labels:A simple solid 2-button suit (a darker shade of grey or navy), simple shirt (white or blue), a simple tie (no in your face colors or patterns), and a simple pair of shoes (black or brown) will cover 99% of formal events. Most people won't notice the fit of a suit so long as it's not overly large/slim, but people notice wrinkles so make sure to press your shirt. A well tied tie (tight knot and dimple) also go a long way.	episode_done:True

text:Prior to the interview for my most recent job, knowing it was a casual work environment, i straight up *asked* them what I should wear for the in-person portion of the interview so as not to be over or under dressed.  My now team leader told me she appreciated that I was thoughtful enough to ask the question. She recommended the more casual end of business casual.  So that echoes your sentiment that a suit shouldn’t be the default.	labels:I second asking if in doubt. Remember that your interview to write code in silicon valley will have a different expectation than your interview to trade currency on wall street. I've had a few candidates ask and I tell them ... I wouldn't care if you showed up in a tshirt though I'd recommend against it because others may care, but "one step up" is a decent rule of thumb and for my industry and area that means nice pants and shirt, no tie etc, is fine to interview.   I don't care if someone is overdressed either but I've twice interviewed candidates who showed up in suits who really should not have; one due to obvious discomfort and one due to that _and_ such horrendously low quality that my $3 tshirt looked good in comparison.	episode_done:True

I wear typically size L for sigfred lambswool sweaters for a slightly oversized fit. I wear a L for Vagn crews. I am looking at the Aslaug brushed lambswool in size L and it's a women's sweater.

text:Fall Fit Battle - Final Four - Discussion	labels:**NgoKnows** vs Chunsak. I'm a little bit let down by Chunsak's colour palette, whereas Ngo rocks it in this department. I'm also giving points to Ngo for the better trousers-to-footwear transition. Notably, both did a cheeky thing with showing a little bit of a white sock, but this too is nicer in Ngo's fit. Clear winner for me.  8888plasma vs **Rariora**. I'm a little bit let down by both fits (but I am coming into this with extremely high expectations). Rariora feels like a rehash of last week (and last week was a better execution of this concept, maybe). plasma is committing to "very cool textures", but aside from this nothing about the silhouette or palette or other French fashion words excites me here. Besides the cool texture clash, I don't think that sweater and trousers work particularly well (tho the belt is cool).
text:Yeah, I do agree with your assessment of my fit - it's somewhat of a rehash. I unfortunately ran into the problem that my wardrobe simply isn't deep enough for the specific context of a fit battle, as I rarely experiment with texture or silhouette in any meaningful way (I tend to stick to a fairly narrow range in those regards). Also, on a day-to-day basis I tend to wear a lot of conventional black basics in combination with my more interesting clothes, which severely limited my options after I had used all my interesting clothes in combination with each other lol  I did have one interesting fit saved for the finals though (on the off chance that I made it to them). In retrospect I probably should've used it here!	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Experimenting With Different Focal Lengths & Landscape || Portrait	labels:[INVALID]	episode_done:True
text:Experimenting With Different Focal Lengths & Landscape || Portrait	labels:I think I prefer the 70 in both landscape and portrait. The wider angle lenses distort the features to the edge of the frame (head, feet) and force you to position the camera at an unflattering angle.
text:cool cool, thanks!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Experimenting With Different Focal Lengths & Landscape || Portrait	labels:For a straight on shot, yes, a longer focal length will look more objective and usually better, as well as compress the depth of field. But, I'd say the shorter focal lengths would be more appealing if you composed the shot to take advantage of the lenses!  A wider lens will look best when you're making use of and exaggerating depth, so maybe a seated pose with the legs stretching towards camera, or shooting from below or above, getting closer to details of the subject.  I do a decent amount of photography, and I wouldn't take out a wide lens just to take the exact same shot I would've with a longer lens. Adapt your approach to your gear!
text:Thanks for responding! I agree with the last paragraph I have a 20-70 and have been shooting between 55-70 mostly for the portraits. Thanks for the ideas with getting more stylized shots with the wider lens, I'll definitely explore trying some more unique angles out.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Experimenting With Different Focal Lengths & Landscape || Portrait	labels:70 is best in both cases imo, which is certainly the objective decision for a portrait focal length. 50 is fine, And tbh I’ve take portraits I’m personally proud of on a 35mm full frame and 45mm equivalent on medium format film (actual lens focal length is 75mm) so it is certainly doable. I saw you’re on the Sony a7iii and if you want a portrait lens, the 85mm f1.8 is insanely good and not terribly expensive all things considered. I don’t do much digital shooting but I absolutely love the results of that lens. I’m usually real lazy and just use my phone, if I set up my camera I just use the kit lens set to 28mm bc I don’t have enough room in my apartment to use anything more.
text:I got to try the 85 1.8 from one of my friends and it was so fun to shoot with! I currently have a 20-70 and 50 1.8 prime, thinking of getting a 70-200 or similar for sports photography and maybe doubling it as a portrait lense. Thanks for the reply!	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Advanced Fit Pic Techniques	labels:- Focal Length: 50mm (on an APS-C sensor). That’s pretty long and I basically have my camera set up at the other end of the room.  - Aperture: Usually f/4.  - Lighting: midday at a north-facing window. Gives a very bright, blueish hue that brings out black clothes quite well imho.  - Background: just what I have in that corner of the room. The wall there happens to be painted in a metallic blue which might help with the lighting. I’d prefer white, but I’m not going to repaint for taking fitpics.  - Angle: I keep the lens pretty much at navel height. I think that gives the most neutral representation of the fit.  - Editing: The camera is sometimes having trouble computing the correct exposure for an all black fit (I have it on shutter priority because lazy). I usually play with the curves tool in post to get the textures right.  FWIW, my camera is an ancient Nikon D90. It still outperforms a modern smartphone, but it’s getting pretty close.	episode_done:True

I assume it'll give me weird proportions anyway so I'll probably just use it for quick photos.

text:I keep getting moth holes in suit jackets - how to solve problem?	labels:Put clothes away cleaned and you have fewer issues. The grubs like to eat the human oils we leave on clothing.   You can also wrap/bag your clothes, better still vacuum pack them if that won't crease the clothes too much. Freezing them also works.  I've had good success with cedar cubes in drawers too, I haven't found it to be a myth but maybe it's coincidence nothing got eaten. You need to give them a little sand to keep them fresh every year or so.	episode_done:True

Citronella oil. best bought online or in quantities of around 100 mls otherwise works out expensive. get some cotton wool pack into small balls soak balls with with oil on a weekly basis for a natural repellent. Pack them in the closet but bne careful they don't come into contct with clothes  You can also get moth traps, sticky things which they will stick to  Seal suits up in zipped garment bags as previous suggestions  Central heating doesn't help  be clean in the home make sure you vacuum regularly especially corners and edges because eggs are laid in corners	episode_done:True
text:I keep getting moth holes in suit jackets - how to solve problem?	labels:Take all the clothing out of that closet and have it all cleaned. Before putting it back, vacuum and clean the fuck out of the closet. Woodwork, corners, cracks in the wood floor, etc. Wash it down and let it dry completely with a fan. Buy some moth traps and hang them in the empty closet. All they do is show the presence of the moths... which lay the eggs and spawn the larvae which eat the clothes. But if you have the traps in the closet for a couple months and see no moths stuck to it, you should be good. Only then put your clean clothes back in the closet. Google around for some chemical pesticide control, too. Cedar is a myth... but it does smell nice! And clean the fuck out of the room the closet is in, too.  Anything wool should be put away clean in sealed plastic bins or ***sealed*** bags. You can't seal everything all the time. So, keeping the door open helps, too. The bugs like complete darkness and trapped air. Move the clothes around from time to time. They like tightness, moisture, and dark conditions. They like to eat oil-stained clothing. Don't overstuff things in the closet.  It's a lot of stuff to do, but if you DO have a problem, you have to really get rid of them thoroughly and completely or it'll just keep happening. So don't half-ass it.  These techniques worked for me. They aren't a nightmare like bed bugs, but it takes work or they just come back.  PRO TIP: quarantine any wool items that have been held in a rental storage space. That's what happened to me. Someone else has bugs, and they find your stuff.  I had moved and had some clothes and wool rugs stored for just a couple  months. They destroyed my one (very nice) wool oriental carpet. Quarter-sized holes. It wasn't as bad a problem for my clothes, but I freaked out with the rugs and went ballistic on my new closets and clothes. I haven't had a problem in over two years now.	episode_done:True

text:Serious answer...  Geo-politically, in the rundown of the British Empire to the setting up of the modern United Kingdom, British politicians have consciously latched themselves onto the USA due to shared history, languages, similar culture and values.   American culture has had a massive influence on British due to shared language historically. Even in the so-called Golden Age of Cinema most movies shown in Britain were produced in the USA. This carried on by large with new forms of communication and entertainment like TV and social media. Most Western social media is by default American social media even in a globalised world.  Furthermore in the run-up to Brexit and during it currently a lot of political weight has been thrown to a US-UK trade deal. A change in President, or keeping the current, would mean a change in the trade negotiation and political policymaking process. The recent trade deals with Japan and Kenya a tiny in levels of importance. A trade deal with the USA is not.  Finally, we're not due another UK General Election according to the Fixed Term Parliament Act for a while, and I doubt we'd call one during a pandemic with a majority of MPs voting for it. Sometimes the media just want to focus on something else for a time. If you're upset enough you can always complain to the BBC or Ofcom via email.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Thanks for taking us along this cycle, it's been a pleasure! I get that by "break" you probably just mean stopping active consumption of fashion as a hobby and just wearing shit, but unless you have a box of video game tees and ill-fitting loose jeans stashed somewhere to replace your current wide tees and well-fitting loose pants I don't know how you can *really* stop with your very fashionable wardrobe.   That's what I love about this stuff personally, I can't completely drop it like every other hobby I've had cause even if I stopped giving a shit I couldn't truly stop giving a shit with my wardrobe and cause everybody *has* to wear clothing.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- November 02	labels:I turn 33 in a few months.  This is an unusual time in life for clothing.  On one hand, I've gotten too old to really follow trends closely, but on the other hand, I don't want to be one of those people who wears what was popular when he was 26 forever.  I'd feel goofy in a pair of wide-leg ankle-cut pants and a Carhartt jacket, but I also realize that black skinny jeans and plaid button-ups are past their prime.  So what's a man my age to do?  I've been working on finding a balance lately, but it's not as clear-cut as I'd hoped.
text:I'm also in my 30ies. Not getting stuck in one particular style is not about making radical changes every few years, it's just incrementally growing your wardrobe with you. You don't have to fully committ to W I D E if that's not your thing, but perhaps gradually phase out the skinny jeans for some straight cut trousers. See what of the stuff that you have already works with that, see what doesn't, take it from there etc.  But really, the best advice I have is just to wear what you like and own it.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Overhauling my wardrobe with lasting pieces	labels:I would generally be cautious of "cut out the middle-man" or "luxury without the logo" companies - I'm sure some of them exist that make genuinely good products but there's a lot of them that don't come anywhere near the quality. It's often just another sales pitch.  I'd also be cautious with trying to buy a new wardrobe all at once, especially with the goal of everything in it lasting a long time, as tastes and bodies both change. If you happen to stay in the same place aesthetically and physically for the next ten years, more power to you, but having been here a while I'd say that kind of thing is rare.
text:That's true. I have never not fit a large though. I'm not getting custom tailored pieces here, just ones that I will be able to wear regardless.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Overhauling my wardrobe with lasting pieces	labels:Brands can have multiple styles that they sell that can go many different ways, so just recommending brands may not be the best idea. Lots of brands sell some pretty hideous things too.   If you want to start finding good value items, which it seems like is your goal, go used or vintage. Look at places like thrift stores and sites like Etsy and eBay. You’ll be spending a lot less and can find pretty good deals from time to time. You’re going to make mistakes and not wear everything you buy, so start small and go from there.   The point on “outlasting”, it matters far more how you take care of it. Think of it like a car, if you drive it 100 miles everyday and rarely take it in for service or just let it rest, it’ll wear down pretty fast. But if you take that same car and drive it twice a week for 20 miles, keep it in a garage, do your preventative maintenance, it’s going to likely look great and drive better in 10 years even if it’s a piece of junk.   My suggestion is to rotate if you want things to last. Don’t wear the same pair of shoes everyday, let them take 24 hours to breathe and air out. Give them the care they need. Same goes for jackets and other clothes. Two pairs of cheap boots that are taken care of will likely last longer than a pair of expensive boots that are worn till they crumble apart.  Quick edit: luxury does not mean it will last. Many luxury items are made of fine fabrics that are not as durable as cheaper versions or similar.

text:Overhauling my wardrobe with lasting pieces	labels:For jeans, I’d recommend investing in a pair of raw denim. It is to denim what Goodyear welting is to shoes.

text:Overhauling my wardrobe with lasting pieces	labels:You probably need to up your jacket budget.

text:Overhauling my wardrobe with lasting pieces	labels:Not to steal /r/mruzzy's glory. But Outlier.   Not all of their stuff is as durable as you're looking for. Even the founder said that when someone asked a similar question on /r/Outlier.  If you want durable bottoms: Futureworks, New Way Shorts, and StrongDungarees cannot be beat. Sometimes you can grab overshirts in the same materials these are made of, and they should hold up well.  They are scaling back their insulated jacket offerings due to various reasons, but the Slash Fortress is a tank and a half. It literally weighs five pounds and I don't know how you would destroy it.  The merino stuff, while I've never had issues with it, isn't going to be as durable as you want. You'll want to look at Wool and Prince (just one example) for core-nylon merino. Even a little bit of nylon makes a huge difference. Or go with heavy cotton (not my thing) or synthetics (which will be an exercise in finding something that doesn't look like you're...exercising).  If you're looking for a shell jacket (which are super useful), ten years might be hard to make. Especially in your price range. Regardless, if you can find a 3L jacket in your range, they will last the longest. Even though I've been sold on anything-but-Goretex, they do have the most experience in creating shells which should lead to your jacket lasting longer. Combine that with a lifetime warranty from Arcteryx (or Veilance if you have the money to look stylish and warm), you can't lose.   Sweaters/cardigans: Mission Workshop (lifetime warranty) and SNS Herning both makes super nice stuff that should last a long time. I'm pretty limited in range here but that'll give you an idea.
text:You spent a lot of time writing this comment and I appreciate all that for you put into it. I will definitely be looking into these options over the next few days. I recently bought a Hyde Park Oxford shirt from Land's end that fits really well and I'm in love with it. I'm so excited to see all the other great options out there!	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Overhauling my wardrobe with lasting pieces	labels:People may turn their noses up at Banana Republic but I think they offer great value especially if you are a tall fellow. They have a 50 percent off sale quarterly and you could easily overhaul your wardrobe for like less than 500 bucks. They definitely lean more classic/conservative. You aren’t going to be turning heads but you won’t be out of style either. Longevity is probably the only thing you need to be wary of. Their denim, chinos and jackets have been good for me, but their knitwear is hit or miss.
text:I second this recommendation for OP.  Banana Republic is my go-to for exactly three things: Inoffensive winter basics, chinos, and short-sleeve prints (because for some bizarre reason, they're great at them). When I say winter basics, I mean solid-color sweaters/cardigans/pullovers. BR hits an amazing value proposition when their stuff is on sale.   Not sure any of it will last 10 years, but I don't think that's a realistic expectation for any clothing except suits.	labels:Good to know! Thanks so much for that valuable inputs 🙏	episode_done:True

Definitely an unexpected strength of theirs. I do have a few of their sweaters, which I generally like, but their new merino blend is not for me. It’s softer/more luxurious feeling but seems less durable. Whether it is or not, I don’t know. I would just opt for heavier woven sweaters personally.
text:The oversupply of Merino wool is definitely not being used well by low-to-mall-tier brands. They're treating it like a softening agent instead of the star of the show. Best to look at brands who already do good Merino sweaters and buy there.	labels:Interesting, I didn’t know that. Who would you recommend?
text:Honestly, I don't know. I went to the mall a couple weeks ago and was let down by most of the sweaters I saw. It's the same thing you observed... Everything felt flimsy. For reference, I stopped in Target, Macy's, Banana Republic, Nordstrom's and Bloomingdales. Bloomingdales/Nordstrom's had some stuff I would consider, but the prices were commensurate with high-end brands, so ~$150-200 for jumpers and turtlenecks.  Edit: Correcting myself here... $150-200 is more like mid-tier all things considered.	labels:I know what you mean. A lot of the sweaters I’ve been trying these days feel more like “dress” sweaters than everyday wear. And yeah I certainly wouldn’t pay full price for any of those upper-mid tier brands. On sale they are good value but otherwise I’m not so sure.	episode_done:True

text:Permanent Style - Tucked in T-Shirt	labels:i’ve been tucking my tee every day for probably about four years now. I dunno what it is, but it just really clicked for me. it looks especially good when you’re wearing the tee under an overshirt or jacket, since you no longer have to deal with the hem of the tee sitting at an awkward length underneath the jacket (or being *longer* than the jacket, which was an old pet peeve of mine). tucking creates a very nice line that looks like this: \_|-|_  generally, this look works best with boxier tees and pants, *or* very slim stuff a la the old “Saint Laurent” look. trying to do this while wearing your garden variety slim t-shirts and slim chinos is when you get into the uncanny territory of feeling like your dad in an unfashionable way.

text:Chelsea boots under €200	labels:Try Herrings Shoes. They outsource the manufacturing, mainly to Spain and Portugal (UK on more expensive ones), but the pricing is rather competitive. Ships over from the UK. The Herrings Ipswitch and the Herrings MacclesField are well under 200 Euros, even including VAT and shipping.  My personal recommendation is the Herrings Chichester.

Not many other brands under $300 attempt the sleek SLP silhouette (even ASOS doesn't do it that well).   In my experience while the ASOS chelseas aren't amazing and don't compare to my Story et Falls at all, they're great for trying out the look and also holding yourself over while your feet are still growing. While they aren't great, they'll last you at least a decent amount of time.

But I will be wearing the boots with a Medium Blue or Navy Suit. * I am a minimalist with two pairs of black skinny jeans. My shirts are all Navy Blue or Black. One exception is an oxford shirt with Army Green color (no patterns, I am boring). * I got two winter jackets. One is leather, chocolate color. The other is very dark navy blue, almost black.  Which color do I get? I will have to buy a matching leather belt either way.  * If I get the Burgundy, I will have to change my two skinny jeans into Gray.

I'm around 97 cm or 38 inch on both my chest and belly (waist only 86 / 34 though) and Large in regular tank tops already sits a bit loose on me in general.

Stringer tanks seem to be made to be made so that they're pretty loose, but fit snug on a guy with large traps, something I definitely lack.

text:Are there any alternatives to a suit that you know about or your culture uses?	labels:In bangladesh for formal occasions you might wear a normal suit, but more common is a Panjabi and white Paijama. They are both basically made of thin fabric so are good for summer. The panjabi is often a deep colour with a lot of embroidery, but you can get light coloured simple ones too. Pair it with leather shoes or sandals.   My dad personally wears a panjabi with suit trousers and a suit jacket. We live in england. I only bring out the panjabi for special occasions like weddings
text:That's fascinating! I'm checking out the images now and it seems like exactly the kind of formal wear I was thinking about: ornamental, sleek, and appropriate for the climate. Mixing it with a jacket is also an interesting hybrid. It allows you to be sensible, express your culture, and take ownership of what was essentially a British standard set on the world. I might look into exploring a combination of a guayabera with "suit" like ornamentation.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Are there any alternatives to a suit that you know about or your culture uses?	labels:>If it was a professional standard to wear shorts to work instead of suit pants, would we be buying designer thermal work shorts made out of wool?  We probably would. Comfort is not the only constraint on clothing — we also must consider what will send the proper message across. If you want to look like a competent professional, in most industries the way to do that is to wear a jacket and tie. There is no way around this; it is entrenched. The important part here is not what *you* think of your appearance, but what *the other person* perceives about you *based* on your appearance.  Attempts to wear other cultures’ formal attire will 1) look very strange, 2) not send the desired message to the other party, because they probably won’t know other cultures’ clothing, and 3) require explanation if you don’t want people to think you don’t know how to dress. In short, it’s probably easier simply to endure a bit of discomfort (or buy nicer clothing) than it is to try to change the cultural perception of business attire.	episode_done:True

They are quite cool replacement for suits in case you want to throw some diversity into your wardrobe. But both are generally non work, formal function attire. Next time you are invited to an Indian/Pakistani/Bangladeshi/Sri Lankan or even middle eastern wedding, you can wear it. If you want to wow people even more, you can try Angrakha suits. They are predecessor of above suits and were worn in courts of Mughal emperors of India.
text:Wow those Jodhpuri's are fly! Out of curiosity, although I get confused for indian/middle eastern pretty often, I know that there's a lot of sensitivity right now when it comes to cultural appropriation. Would you say it would be generally accepted to wear these outfits to a Indian or Pakistani wedding, or that it isn't that common outside of the people?	labels:Of course man. It's not cultural appropriation, it's cultural appreciation. As long as you refer to the suits with their original names (Jodhpuris, Sherwanis etc.) you are good. When Justin Trudeau visited India on a state visit a year or two back, he and his entire family dressed up in Indian attire. If you are attending this wedding with  gf/wife may I suggest Lehengas for her.	episode_done:True

text:Learning to dress better	labels:I would refer to the established guides in MFA first to build the foundation of developing style. Everyone's style is different (budget, size, colour preference, etc) so there isn't just some quick bullet points that can "define style". How I like to figure out style is to browse online such as websites like Highsnobiety, or Instagram accounts (@hidden.ny) and just save photos. Build up a folder that you can reference so if you see something in store that is similar to something you saw then you know what to buy.   In regards to hair, I think this is very important. There's nothing worse than spending a lot of money on a nice wardrobe but have a crappy haircut. Think of it this way; your tshirt or jeans may be worn once or twice a week at most; your hair is part of your outfit 24/7. Invest in a good haircut and products to maintain it. Growing your hair isn't an issue as there are plenty of guides for longer hairstyles.

text:Learning to dress better	labels:Seems like the info in the guides would have been useful. Do you have specific questions beyond that?  As far as the hair questions, I think it matters a little bit. Hair color affects which clothing colors will be most flattering on you. Outlandish hair styles may clash with conservative attire, while conservative hair styles may clash with edgy alternative attire. But it's possible to toy with the contrast deliberately. For example, Hardcore, Teddy Boy, Lo Head and early Skinhead styles incorporated elements of "smart" (sort of business casual) attire, but recontextualized with bold hairstyles and subversive styling. Best preppy-styled guy I knew shaved his head. It's not what you expect from the clothing, but I thought that it helped him make the look his own rather than a class costume.  So I'm mostly saying don't overthink the hair thing. Hairstyle is probably more personal than clothing, so just choose a style that you like and that suits you. If it's not harmonious with your clothing then tweak something or enjoy the contrast.	episode_done:True
text:Learning to dress better	labels:Some great advice already.   There’s plenty of YouTube videos and Instagram accounts to draw advice from. For example:  Gents Lounge, Real Men Real Style, etc etc  You just have to search and find some you enjoy watching and enjoy the people presenting. Only problem I find is that everyone is trying to sell something or they all encourage buying expensive items. Not always practical.   What I will advise as a student or someone with a lesser budget, or indeed anyone, is you can easy make some outfits work by substituting high street/cheaper brands.   Keep an eye on local charity shops and ebay, If you find something you like and it’s good quality, you can get it for a fraction of the price. Then if you need to take it to your local tailors and have it tailored. The cost of cheaper secondhand and the cost of a tailor can still be far below the original market price of the item.  If you do this, ensure the item is sized larger as it’s easier to take in clothing. Damn near impossible to let out.   I like to keep outfits simple, clean and a good fit. I’m not one for peacocking or over the top fashion style.  Find what works for you and have the confidence to own it. You don’t have to be a cardboard cutout, be yourself.  As for hair, women don’t mind long hair, just as long as it’s clean, maintained and kept. Just because you are growing it long doesn’t mean you have to just neglect it.   Growing it long could be a chance for you to cut it later and find a style you like.	episode_done:True
text:Learning to dress better	labels:If you are looking for more mature stuff to just throw on and not have to think about I would consider starting with a "casual capsule wardrobe" of interchangeable basics.    There are a couple guides if you search them, but if it were me starting over here is what I would do.  **Bottoms:**  Light wash jeans, Navy Chinos, Sand Chinos, Khaki chino shorts **OPTIONAL:** Dark or black wash jeans  **Tops:**   **T-Shirts**(no logo no graphics)**:** 2x white, 1x Navy, 1x Light Grey **Optional:** Offwhite, Charcoal, various pastels, short/longsleeved henleys in any neutral colors.   **Button Downs:** light blue oxford, light pink oxford, **Optional**: gingham button down (light blue or navy), flannel shirt (black and watch or buffalo plaid), White oxford, university stripe oxford.  **Outerwear:** Light Grey crewneck sweatshirt olive anorak (for rain), tan/brown/navy quilted jacket for winter   **Shoes:** White leather gym shoes, brown leather boots or chukkas (pants only) **Optional:**Tan/light brown loafers, brown camp mocs, snow/rain boots (bean boots or hunter mocs)  &#x200B;  Obviously feel free to make it your own, but I would start trying to build solid basics like that that are 100% interchangeable.
text:I've got to admit I'm more than impressed at those recommandations, they're so detailed I can even picture some in my head somehow!

Also word of caution, don’t but everything st the same time. Get a pair of pants, wear them a couple times, make sure you like the fit and everything then start adding more. I have gotten overzealous so many times and doubled down on something that I later decided I wished fit different.  Good luck!
text:Love your comment mate, some really good basic foundations to build on.  Totally agree with the chinos, although I don’t always like the modern fashion of halfway up your ankle. I have a few pairs of this style for summer. But generally I prefer longer trousers.  T-shirt’s kept plain, keep the logo style ones for at home.   I would add a suggestion for a nice peacoat for winter, it’s a classic item that goes well with casual and smarter outfits (not a suit though, go for an overcoat for a suit).  I love a good pair of double monkstraps as a winter shoe, the right colour can make a casual outfit and it fits with smarter looks.   Great advice though!	labels:	episode_done:True

The collection defining details are all in the small things (neckties, sneakers), while the big things that make the silhouette are refinements of things from past seasons (tents, fisherman hats, even an iteration on the window bags(?) from FW20). The vests look like they could be a reference to the tennis silhouettes from the Bjorn Borg collab Craig did way back when. Still a banger of a collection, though. Nothing wrong with a little comfortable consistency right now.   The Adidas collab is still going hard. Can't wait to see that cast shoe show up on r/malefashion.

text:Fall 2020 Fit Battle - Elite 8 - Discussion	labels:Only 8 people so I can stand to do a write up this time.   *HalfTheGold vs. Plasma*  Both pretty solid fits. Plasma edged this one out for me just because Chuck's seemed a bit too similar to last week. I do wish Plasma's trousers leaned a bit more to one extreme of fit, to me they seem in kind of a no man's land of straight.  *Raiora vs. Sal*  Tough one to pick for me. Raiora always brings a crazy mix of pieces together and they always work so well. However, this time I think the trousers were a bit too flat looking in texture compared to the guage of the cardigan. Sals fit was unexpected but good, the overlapping layers and texture mixing was really cool imo.  *Joel vs. Ngo*  I went back and forth on this one for awhile, definitely most difficult match-up for me. Both had some very similar ideas with silhouette, both executed very well. My personal preference is towards Ngo as I really liked the subtle textures displayed in his detail shot, but in the end I copped out and voted for both.  *Chunsak vs. Comeback*  Always love seeing what these guys bring to the table. Both their fits are great, but Chunsak going maximal English countryside estate owner won me over in the end.	episode_done:True
text:Fall 2020 Fit Battle - Elite 8 - Discussion	labels:Carrying the dim lighting torch for my fallen brethren o7  But seriously I'm loving plasma's textures, Chuck's drakes-esque collar layering, Joel's monster tractor sandals, and of course Chun's head to toe hummingbird jacquard.

I wish we had an alternate with the sleeves down though. Chuck's depriving us of having MAXIMUM fun with layering the shirt, but I really like how the different colors pop out of the sweater. However, don't think the popped collar works very well with the neck of the sweater, worked better last week imo. ^^^I ^^^died ^^^for ^^^this, ^^^Chuck? ^^^for ^^^THIS!?     Rariora vs Salutorian: Really fuck with Rariora's drop shoulder cardigan. Top half feels like comfy wfh, bottom half feels more formal, to me it feels kinda incongruent. Sal's fit has really grown on me, the sock and sandals combo in the deets shot is so damn cool.  This one got more difficult for me the longer I looked at them. Haven't voted on this one yet, gunna let it stew.     NgoKnows vs **DeLaJoel**: DLJ knocks it outta the park here, such a cool fil. Colors and silhouette are just awesome all around. The shirt is such an awesome piece. Really dig Ngo's fit too, especially with the scarf. Feels like it should be in a Fall inspo album. But Cheesin' Joel is just too powerful.     **Chunsak** vs Thecomebackkid: Good god man. I really really like TCK's fit overall, but I think Chun's fit here is the best of the whole battle.

text:Fall 2020 Fit Battle - Elite 8 - Discussion	labels:HalfTheGoldTreasure vs **8888plasma**. plasma goes for restrained maximalism with a peacock print shirt and textured trousers. Shirt is interesting without being obnoxious and works well with the trousers. I feel that more could have been done with the footwear. Chuck feels like a (weaker?) rehash of last week with the lazy collar over a white sweater. I enjoyed last week's all-white more, felt more conceptual. The shirt looks interesting, but is hidden by the sweater.  Salutatorian vs **Rariora**. Rariora gives me great wfh vibes, with a cozy duster cardigan (dropped shoulders make it appropriately slouchy) over an eyecatching print. Trousers add further visual interest without being distrcting.  Salutatorian does something unexpected here by pairing winter socks in sandals with a very wintery pair of trousers. The jacket+turtleneck matches the cold weather theme, but its not as interesting as Rariora's offering.  NgoKnows vs **DeLaJoel**. Both come in hard. Joel's main is really amazingly well paired between the coat, the jacket, tee and trousers. Very pleasing. I'm not into the sandals but that might just be me. Ngo has a very cool vibe, bit more rugged and casual. I'm a sucker for the kind of refinement that Joel displays here, so he gets my vote.  thecomebackkid vs **Chunsak**. Chunsak's main made me audibly gasp. The fluffy coat over *that suit* is just too good. I'm even okay with these shoes under that suit, even though I normally ~~detest~~ don't like the wallabee shape. Thecomebackkid's tweed, flannel and (I think?) corduroy combo is great (and seasonally appropriate), but pales in comparison.

text:A Basic Guide to Useful Knitwear	labels:I’m going to disagree that no seams is a rule of thumb for better construction—sometimes those seams help give you more structure and a better tailored look. It depends on the type of sweater you’re aiming for, of course, but something like a shawl collared cardigan in a heavy knit would benefit from a size seam to help keep it from ending up around your knees by the end of the day.   If you’re a trans man like myself, the side seam will help give you a line for the eye to follow along the sides of your body, too.   I only add these as considerations because I knit and design my own garments and while the rule of thumb isn’t necessarily entirely wrong, it’s really more nuanced than “avoid side seams because it’s better constructed”	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - October 29	labels:I'm watching *Next in Fashion*. I kinda like how it is *not* like Project Runway in that the challenges are not like "design a gown out of garbage", but these are great designers, they get everything they need and are supposed to make the best possible design they can, no constraints except time.  But sometimes the show feels so inconsistent. There is not a *lot* of manufactured drama, but when there is, they turn it up to 11 (and I roll my eyes so hard they might pop out). I also don't need the "human interest" tear-jerker backgrounds. Focus on the designs, ffs. They almost always do women's *and* menswear (which is great), but then for the women models they promote some kind of body shape diversity, whereas the male models are all *very* conventionally attractive. Feels half-assed. Tan France isn't half as funny as he thinks he is (more eye rolling).  Overall I enjoyed it, but I can see how it got cancelled. Netflix also did a shit job promoting it.
text:Pretty much agree. I'm not sure how real the time constraints are but they could give the designers a lot more time, given it is a design competition and not speed-tailoring.

Something something no ethical consumption something something.

I think the important takeaway is that there are really not likely going to be shortcuts here - you are likely going to find scratchiness at lower price points, and moving up the pricing ladder, you may find that the ply numbers align with price = wool sweaters whose weight is in pounds not ounces are going to cost $XXX not $XX.  Also, if you do value horn versus leather buttons, you are further slicing your options - there is a strong correlation with Scottish knits with "tradition", and that means the default tends to be leather buttons. In fact, years ago I was at NMWA when a S&C order came in... with leather buttons. I think that meant they had to ship back a few cubic yards worth of cardigans
text:You're right, there aren't short cuts to this level of quality.  I think this knit represents the best entry level option for this sort of sweater. It's not as heavy, but it's FAR from insubstantial.  I don't mind the leather buttons, but they definitely add a level of "Old fogey" vibes if you're not careful.  Even horn buttons can miss the mark, I saw the new Spier & Mackay chunky cardigan and a common comment is that the buttons are just a bit too large.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Winston & Co. Shawl Collar Cardigan Review (But mostly preamble)	labels:thanks for this review. I love shawl collar cardigans but i'm very sensitive to itchy wool, which makes it very difficult to find them. would you happen to know of any decent/higher end ones constructed in alternative materials?
text:I think the most obvious alternative - albeit $$$ - would be cashmere. There's quite a few options that have the same basic rib design as OP's wool version. I think the challenge with cashmere is that if what you want is a super-chunky look, your options become more limited since cashmere tends to be finer and thus the sweaters don't always have the same heft. That said, if you're willing to invest in a 4-ply or higher cashmere SCC, you might be able to attain that nice chunky look.   Personally, when I'm working from home, I have a knockabout 2-ply cashmere SCC that I'll wear when I just want a warm layer; it's really nothing special and doesn't look anywhere as substantial as my Northern Watters-made lambswool SCC but it's kind of perfect for a home sweater.   The other common option would be cotton or linen or blends of both but then you lose out on warmth/insulation. That said, I had a cotton SCC for years that was a go-to "lemme just throw on a layer" option in temperate months.   Do you have the same reaction to merino?	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Winston & Co. Shawl Collar Cardigan Review (But mostly preamble)	labels:Nice review :)  How do you deal with scratchy wool? Do you seek another cardigan or try other methods to mitigate the problem?
text:Thank you.  I used Eucalan wool wash on the Richmond Knitwear cardigan, it's a no-rinse wash with added Lanolin. I found the itchiness was somewhat mitigated after adding back some of those natural oils. The cardigan took 4 days to dry, but it was worth it. I'm a lot less sensitive to itchy wool than most people I know, so I'm already at an advantage though.  There's no point in having a garment you don't like wearing, so if the itchiness is such that you can't abide it...keep looking. As I said the Winston & Co. is very soft, but the quality of the wool is excellent and the final wash contributes to the soft handle.  Scottish waters are renowned for being balanced, so when rinsed they allow for a nice finish without damaging the fibres. Often times wool can be treated as part of its finishing process to soften it, but this treatment will degrade and shorten the lifespan of the yarn.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Its not about assessing fashion and art. I can understand what she was doing and why its significant - and I can also be skeptical of its significance. Its goofy to me people would simp so hard for someone who "wanted to change the system from within" and apply leftist politics to market what is and remains a luxury brand - she even admits a fashion designer was antithetical to her political stance growing up, but she was too seduced by beauty to leave the world of fashion.   So color me none surprised when she goes on to become a billionaire off the backs of slaves.   My point isnt "nylon isnt luxury so she shouldnt sell cheap synthetics to rich people as a statement against fashion" its "being a luxury brand is antithetical in its very nature to the same politics you so self ascribe and market with - but the fact you found out a way to both use cheap materials with same upcharge and feel good about yourself is a perfect cherry to top it off"	labels:[INVALID]	episode_done:True

Can't really say how much MFA just sat within this zeitgeist and how much it helped shape and propagate it.  True as well.  It's hard and uncomfortable to think about, but at that time you really had to couch things in such ways because men (straight men) were generally just uncomfortable thinking about/caring about their appearance. "Metrosexual", as a term, came about (much earlier, in the early aughts iirc) because it was so hard to imagine *straight men* caring about their appearance.  Whereas now someone saying "I just don't want to look gay" is a borderline bannable offense, at the time it was the mindset of the entire ecosystem, really. Mad Men, lumberjacks, James Dean, and Steve McQueen; nothing to worry about, there. The couching of these things in terms of *timelessness*, or *classicness* or *investment*, or *gentlemanliness*, or whatever, was a way of making it acceptable for you to care about your appearance and work on it.	labels:Oh, yeah, *Mad Men*, I forgot about that. Showing to everyone that back when men were men, it was okay for *these* men to care about their suits, but in a *manly* way. It's coming back to me. I think some even went all the way back to chivalric virtues in their quest for manliness.  I guess it was a necessary step to go that route so men could see that it is and has always been okay to care about one's appearance.

We've come a long way from "well dressed men wear suits" to "actually shirts and blazers can be dressed down" to "actually you can wear what you want and look good", and maybe the whole "timeless", "dapper", "classic", "gentleman" thing was a necessary part of the journey, but... would it just fucking die please.

A cheap one off Uniqlo and a Peak Design bag off eBay for mega cheaps. Easy to throw on, put a mask in, small water bottle, or whatever when I decide to go for a quick walk-break. And the peak design is slightly padded and larger which helps for cameras or small food shops lol.  I *do* have some stuff I want to buy, but honestly it's more lust than utilitarianism. I have enough shoes and jackets as it is. If I bought something new I'd feel obliged to sell something of mine.

text:How has lockdown affected new purchases?	labels:At the start of the year I set a goal to focus this year on overhauling my business casual wardrobe for work. Bought a nice blazer in February and got to wear it once to the office before it closed. Luckily that was the only thing I bought for work. Lately I've just been focused on my casual wardrobe since that's all I wear now, and acquiring more interesting or unique pieces to supplement the basics I've focused on in prior years: sneakers,   As far as timing goes I didn't buy anything in March/April. That was a rough time... my work was discussing layoffs, I wasn't sure if my wife would do the same, and my 401k was tanking. It felt safer to sit on any cash that came in. Fortunately we've managed to maintain our jobs and our health.  In May I bought a few secondhand grails but still shied away from impulse buys. Late June I'd say my spending on clothes picked up again. That's when restrictions started to be lifted here in New York and it actually felt safe to leave the apartment (with a mask) and walk around or sit outside for outdoor dining. I'm not out as often as I was pre-Covid but when I do go out I take the opportunity to wear some of my favorite pieces and as I reach for certain things most often I start to get a better idea of my personal style.	episode_done:True

The window for wearing the basic clothing you've suggested is huge, you're not going to be perceived as cute when you're in your 40s but none of the basic clothing you've suggested is going to make you look like a desperate old man, and your tastes will probably have changed by the time you get there anyway.	episode_done:True
text:When will I be "too old" to look cute, cool, hip, whatever?	labels:36 year old here, grinding my teeth at you for asking this question at 22.  This is my constant internal monologue, but I think that it is always appropriate to try and present yourself to others in the best possible light.  I can't tell you how things will change for you, but I have found that my tastes have developed and age has sanded off the fringiest edges of my fashion interests.  I used to want to (relatively) keep up with trends, and now my aesthetic goal has shifted into a desire for a more timeless look; probably because at 36 I would also like to be timeless.  So at the end of the day I hope to dress like someone that wears quality clothes, with a flattering fit, and they indicate that I care about my appearance.  And I don't think you're ever too old to fit that criteria.  The fact that you're asking the question probably means that you are introspective and will adjust your style as well.
text:Also 36 and you summed up how I feel exactly.   I moved from a big city to a smaller blue collar city a few years ago, around the same time I had my first kid.

The question is why do you want this? It seems like you want to do it just for attiention sake and if that's the case you're setting yourself up for a life of unhappiness.  As you grow your style will change, be confident in YOUR style and people will respect you.  Im 25 my style has always been classically masculine, dapper, smart, and a bit artistic. I never dressed like my peers. People close to me started mimicking my style and women always loved the way I dressed.  And I think its because I wrote my clothes confidently.   With that said you can do whatever you want to do. If you want to be 50 with skinny jeans and a graphic-t that's fine.  Be confident and Make sure that's what you want.

text:what do yall wear to the gym (or at home if you work out there)	labels:I'd like to go deeper and talk about fabrics and the clothing in the gym. There are fabrics that leave you soaking in sweat after your routine while some that just makes you feel uncomfortable while running in trails. For my experience I can suggest to use cotton, nylon or polyester.    In terms of avoiding whiff in workout apparels, cotton wins over polyester. This is because studies discovered that it provides less post-workout stench compared to polyester since synthetic fabrics allow the multiplication of stink-causing bacteria.    Polyester is one of the most famous types of workout fabrics that’s primarily plastic cloth. It is efficient as a fitness apparel because it’s durable, lightweight, breathable, wrinkle-resistant and non-absorbent.    Nylon is found in various kinds of sportswear for being breathable and sweat-wicking. In fact, a lot of its users say that it can stand up to even the sweatiest of workouts.    Recently I ordered a cotton T-shirt from True Classic. I can say that it's very comfortable, the fabric is good quality and non-absorbent.	episode_done:True

People in Uzbekistan are (mostly were these days, as you read) forced to work at certain times of year, so they're temporary slaves, which just sounds kinda odd.	labels:[INVALID]	episode_done:True

text:FAQ: When shopping on a budget, what items have the highest point at which they reach diminishing returns?	labels:In my experience, lower quality at lower price points is most noticeable for outerwear, footwear, or knits (I guess because they all serve a functional purpose) and spending more tends to lead to a more noticeable improvement in quality up to a certain point. That's painting with a broad brush though... leather dress shoes and boots scale much better than sneakers or sandals, where mid-range options are going to be good enough for most people.  T-shirts, dress shirts, denim, and accessories in low-to-mid-range are generally good enough from a quality perspective IMO and I've only really paid more in those categories for a design I like rather than because I think I'm getting something higher quality. There's nothing wrong IMO with buying something because you like the way it looks even if a similar quality alternative exists at a lower price, but that's harder to do if you're shopping on a budget.  I'll also add that for all of the above, your dollar goes a lot farther if you're willing to shop used. Sites like Ebay, Grailed, reddit/styleforum B/S/T threads, etc. have made it a lot easier to buy preowned clothes without having to set foot into a thrift store.  TL;DR When shopping on a budget I'd focus first on having a high quality pair of shoes and jacket. Consider buying used clothes to stretch your budget further.

text:> ower quality at lower price points is most noticeable for outerwear, footwear, or knits (I guess because they all serve a functional purpose)  Also because of the cost of raw materials like wool or leather. A $100 wool coat will always be thin and flimsy because wool isn't cheap and you need a lot of it for a coat. The only way to make that $100 coat is to use less wool, either by replacing some of it with polyester or by using less of it.  (Which, in this specific example, leads to people buying a cheap woollen coat and a cheap down jacket and wearing them both at the same time. Which does make sense for a lot of people, but I can't help finding it a bit funny.)	labels:	episode_done:True

text: >TL;DR When shopping on a budget I'd focus first on having a high quality pair of shoes and jacket. Consider buying used clothes to stretch your budget further  I volunteer in a charity shop (thrift store/op shop etc) and good coats, jackets and shoes come in *all the time*. Men either look after their clothes or destroy them. Womenswear tends to be more "worn but wearable" (but we easily get five times as much of it donated).   Shop in a slightly more affluent area and you'll find nicer things. Quite often there are a few shops catering to different markets and people (subconsciously?) donate according.   I've got a 1970s sheepskin coat from a charity shop that I'm expecting to last another 50 years at least and a pair of Timberland books that I bought for the change in my pocket eight years ago - they just needed new insoles.	labels:Just to piggyback on this, Timberland quality is shockingly bad these days.

text:I'd say it goes Shoes > Coat/Jacket > Trousers/Jeans > Socks > Shirts > Underwear > Tshirts.  I'm not saying that you can get away with crappy tees but you can definitely find a tee for £10 that's better quality than some of the £80 ones. Favourite tees I've ever owned are Uniqlo U at around £13 and a JCrew washed pocket tee they did maybe 10 years ago that I bought in the US for $20.  If your coat and your shoes are good, you can generally get away with budget on everything else provided it fits. I do think people underestimate how much of a difference a quality pair of denim and good socks make though.	labels:Seconding socks. Good socks are life changing. I read on reddit years ago not to skimp on anything that gets between me and gravity. Tires, boots, mattress, and socks. I rarely wear shoes (boots only) so my socks are purely for personal comfort, and nothing beats a good pair of wool socks. Go darn tough or rag wool knit socks from someone like LL Bean, and learn to darn them, and you'll never go back.	episode_done:True
text:FAQ: When shopping on a budget, what items have the highest point at which they reach diminishing returns?	labels:It’s been said already but shoes, outerwear, and knits definitely. In terms of shoes, I don’t think you really need to spend obscene amounts of money or absolutely must have Goodyear welted construction to get quality or longevity out of your shoes either. In a rotation and with a minimal amount of effort in terms of care, you can get plenty of years out of more mid tier brands. With knits a good work around is just buying cotton instead of wool if you’re on a budget, most cheap wool is not great and cotton will be a bit tougher. If you’re worried about warmth just layer with some heat tech or the like.   The good thing about these 3 though are that the high quality stuff lasts forever so long as you don’t abuse it.	episode_done:True

text:I'm curious at what price do you say you see the best value for knitwear?	labels:Depends pretty heavily on what you're buying. Cashmere will be exceptionally expensive while good shetland wool sweaters can be had for <$100

text:FAQ: When shopping on a budget, what items have the highest point at which they reach diminishing returns?	labels:I thrift quite a bit and take items to my local alterations tailor. Think vintage made in USA items made using natural fabrics (cotton, wool, cashmere). Sometimes they are made with older, odd, or boxy fits that are slightly off. Which leads me to the diminishing returns of...   Tailoring and Alterations (in relation to fit): These costs can add up quickly - and sometimes the end result will not be satisfactory.  Simple alterations like taking in the waist or sleeves usually work out - but major surgery with jacket shoulders and major pant adjustments usually are not worth the effort.    It's ok to pass on a sale or leave an item on the rack if you know the fit or alterations won't work out for you. On the other hand, it can be worth the extra $ to purchase something if it fits very well off-the-rack.	episode_done:True
text:FAQ: When shopping on a budget, what items have the highest point at which they reach diminishing returns?	labels:To answer the question as simply as possible, I would say that in my option the following items have the highest price point in which diminishing returns set in:  - Footwear (shoes / boots) - Jackets (as in coats not blazers)  Once again to keep it simple I would say the reason for this is as follows:  - The amount and size of different (often expensive) materials that make up these products - The amount your likely to wear them - How visible they are as part of your outfit (what I mean by this is if your wearing shoes or a jacket it’s usually the outermost layer and completely visible, a shirt or jumper can be concealed, your jacket can’t be) - The importance of comfort from these items (uncomfortable shoes are torture and a jacket that doesn’t keep you warm / dry is pointless and will make you cold and miserable	episode_done:True
text:FAQ: When shopping on a budget, what items have the highest point at which they reach diminishing returns?	labels:Great responses already. I'll rant a little bit about footwear since that's my specialty so to speak.   I think people still spend far too much on footwear generally. GYW and stitched construction is nice and all, but it's not a cheap option by any means. You get quite high quality leathers from plenty of makers in the <$350 range and there are good options in the $200 range as well depending on the type of shoes/boots you're looking for.   I'm working on a post that talks a bit more about the individual economics of owning even a single pair of "high quality" footwear. Cost of ownership is vastly under estimated by newcomers and expectations overall tend to be set too high.   I still agree that footwear has pretty high diminishing returns, but I also think that a *lot* of people talk themselves into buying stitched construction shoes that are far far too expensive for what they really want.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- October 26	labels:Hello, wondered what the community thinks about 3-piece suits for younger guys.  I am 20y and in need for a new suit, that I would wear semi regularly throughout the year. Need it for oral exams in uni, for a possible internship (law) and more formal events that would come up throughout the year.   Always loved the looks of a 3 piece suit and tend towards more formal clothing in general but really unsure if it is (age) appropriate.   Wouldn't normally care that much about other people's opinion. However I would wear it in occasions where (1st) Impressions do matter. Also considering that I rather spend a bit more on quality, I of course don't want to spend the money and then don't look good.  Worried that it would come of as a bit jarring, or just too much.   Any feedback would be much appreciated.
text:I can't necessarily speak to where you live, but in my 28 years of American life I've been to plenty of formal events and I've seen a 3-piece suit worn less than 5 times. It's definitely a more formal choice than a 2-piece suit and the general shift towards casual clothing means even the occasions for a 2-piece are getting rarer. So I would say that it will likely stand out and catch attention as an intentionally formal and possibly somewhat anachronistic choice.  That being said, I don't think it's inherently a *wrong* or *bad* choice - if you work in an area that requires very formal clothing, it could be useful to have the variety, or if you're aiming for that dandy-ish side of menswear that embraces the affectations, it could definitely have its place.	labels:I live in Austria, where things are bit more formal, at least compared to the US (from what I have seen). So more formal suit varations are not as rare but its still definitely the exception to the rule.   I would definitely expect it to stand out, at least somewhat. My main worry was, that it stand out for the wrong reasons.  I do have a shop near me that has a good selection of 3 piece suits. Just haven't been able to make an appointment due to covid. So actually seeing the suit on my body will hopefully help, in terms of getting a better picture.  Thank you very much, for your advice	episode_done:True

text:20 Sweaters for Less Than $150, So You Can Achieve Peak Coziness - Esquire.com	labels:So I shopped for knits from Uniqlo to BR, Jcrews. Then I upgraded to Harley of Scotland/Howlin -> handknitted Inverallan/Northern Watter.  Every single upgrade I see an increase in material quality, craftsmanship, and design.  I absolutely think your baseline should be around 70ish (used from ebay). Harley, Jamieson, and some brands about that price point are what you want to have. The Japanese made some good one too if you can get it proxy. Beams+ have some good ones and sales randomly, you have to keep checking though. Inis Meain is rare to come across at a low price. I bought one luckily from an eBay auction and it was 150 already for a cardigan.  If you are really into it, Inverallan, Northern Watters are what you wanna seek after.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- October 25	labels:I got a question about shirt sizing... So I'm a short guy (5ft 6in) and long sleeved shirts are usually a problem for me because I have a large chest/shoulders for my height. I just got a Taylor stitch shirt in XS as that's what they're size guide recommended me. However, as is the case with most shirts I try, it's a bit tight in the back (I have a 38in chest). This only applies if I'm crossing my arms, giving a hug, or tying my shoes or something (basically moving both arms forward). The shirt fits everywhere else and is otherwise fine. I know that it I size up though, the shirt length will be a little too long and the sleeve length will be too long, despite fitting more relaxed in the chest/back area.  Do I size up or retain my current size? Again, the only real problem area is that the shirt hugs my chest a little bit and I feel the fabric strain across my back if I try to cross my arms (not enough so that it feels like it will rip, but it still strains).	episode_done:True

"Layer it" -- ah, the standard cliche. 5. "Wear it with this expensive moncler vest, who cares if it looks good? That logo is GIGANTIC!" 6. Two completely different suggestions, one of which is their second unhelpful cliche. Somebody clearly took the photo first and they wrote the tip afterwards. 7. "Play with color." Oh, gee, really? I was only going to wear a white shirt and gray trousers with a navy blazer, ever, but gee, you want me to *consider things*? Cool. Thanks. Super helpful, Mr. P. 8. "More formality" -- shows a wide-open denim shirt, sunglasses, a mess of bracelets under an open wrist...  Yay, I caught 'em all, what do I win?

People have been wearing stuff like this since the 90’s. I’ve been wearing this type of stuff for 7+ years.

text:I think of how most people used to work physical jobs all their lives, and as they aged, their bodies would be shaped by that work - whether muscular, sinewy, bent, etc.  Nowadays though, honestly the dad bod is the same thing.  I'm older than the average redditor and I think of all the people I've known who would rather be moving around more, but have spent decades at a desk because that's what our economy is and because they love and want to care for their families.  That work shapes their bodies in a different way.  My dad went from young & chiseled to old & paunchy as he worked and paid for most of our house, food, education, etc.  So this whole "REAL work vs desk work" thing hits a little hollow for me.  I do think that exploring the sociology behind trends can be very interesting - perhaps we ARE pining for the time when we wore chore jackets to do chores.  But while I'm pretty sympathetic to a lot of legit "haves/have nots" type discussions, this article doesn't hit the mark for me.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- October 23	labels:What is the difference between dadcore and nondadcore chinos?
text:Dadcore = baggy (not W I D E), a full break / pooling around the shoes, a crease, and sometimes pleats (which are making a little bit of a comeback in some contexts). And there’s a specific shade of Dockers-khaki that is completely bland, and therefore goes with everything and nothing at the same time.  You can avoid this by choosing more interesting colors, finding a flattering fit, and paying attention to the break (basically anything is better than pooling around the shoes).	labels:	episode_done:True

Assuming  I'd have a budget of \~£2500 (\~$3250) to slowly build a wardrobe of a  year's worth of clothes, what are the basic fits I should invest in that  would suit best for each season in London?  For  more context, my work dress code is very casual so I can assume  flexibility in mixing different outfits in the future. I also have zero  experience in the concept of layering winter clothes and feel a bit  intimidated in figuring out what I should begin purchasing to start  with. I have tried to find more guides on London, but could only find  ones specific to suits in the wiki.

Any recommendations for a good turtleneck, preferably not too thick of a material, something to layer under a jacket.

text:Best and Worst Purchases of 2020?	labels:Worst: Slim tapered Supreme chinos. Supposed to be 100% cotton but they feel uncomfortably sticky.   Best: native print overshirt jacket by Indian. Far surpasses every other jacket in my wardobe.	episode_done:True
text:Best and Worst Purchases of 2020?	labels:best buy: incotex tricochino chinos - these have a very soft cotton twill yet feels robust. the garment washing effect is great and makes them more casual compared to normal chinos. runner up are Asket tees, and a chore coat and polo from Yeossal  worst: loafers from fugashin received in an exchange. can't get them to fit as they are just too long but other shoes in the same size fit better. even with thicker socks heel still seems to slide out.   OP for your feet problems it is possible to get heel stickers made from leather or synthetic that you put on the inside of the shoe heel, or gel stickers that you apply directly to your foot. maybe try amazon or ebay	episode_done:True
text:Best and Worst Purchases of 2020?	labels:best: viridi anne leather jacket. i got one in nice used condition for $100 and i love the fit and color of it and it's nice to have something that will last me for years  worst: harsh and cruel button up. i don't mind cheap ass Chinese shit and their other stuff i actually liked but i don't know when i am ever going to wear this and i can't really sell it lol	episode_done:True
text:Best and Worst Purchases of 2020?	labels:Best: during early COVID, sales got good enough for me to snag a pair of light grey CPs. I don’t hunt for sales religiously, so I felt especially good seeing them.  They’re my hope sneakers. Hope that eventually we could go out again and I’d have actual reason to wear them.  Worst: didn’t really have much of a reason to buy clothes this year, so nada.	episode_done:True
text:Best and Worst Purchases of 2020?	labels:Best - It's hardly fashion, but I bought a Patagonia Better Sweater a couple weeks ago and I have to say that they live up to the hype. Super warm and comfortable yet also breathes a bit. Been wearing it mostly for early morning dog walking and hiking rather than truly fashionable moments, but super happy with it.  Worst - I misread an eBay listing and accidentally bought a medium tall (rather than large like I intended) J. Crew rugby. It's just too long on me and I don't wear it much (still looks pretty good on Zoom). Nice shirt, though.	episode_done:True
text:Best and Worst Purchases of 2020?	labels:Best: Orslow fatigues- nice straight fit, high rise, comfortable   Worst: apc petit new standards- rise was stupidly low and they were too tight up top, so I sold them for a small loss.   no more low rise for me	episode_done:True
text:Best and Worst Purchases of 2020?	labels:**Best:** Outlier Ramielight Camp Collar in Dark Forest. Such a great shirt that I ended up buying a second one in white. My favorite thing to wear outside this summer whenever I did go out.  **Worst:** Beckett Simonon Morgen all white sneakers. Note, this is my second pair, and this time I decided to go with the all whites instead of re-upping on the gum sole. It's not that I don't like this, it's a combination of not a lot of clothes purchases this year (which has been great) while also not loving them as much as the gum soles. I still have my gum soles and I almost pulled the trigger on another pair this week since they had seconds on sale for $89.	episode_done:True
text:Best and Worst Purchases of 2020?	labels:I keep losing eBay bids and haven't gone thrifting, so I guess I can do my almost best and almost worst.  Almost best: RLPL Grey Dbl Breast Great Coat with angora and cashmere. Exactly my size, super luxurious, sold in the late 80s and early 90s for $1500, but the bid went up to almost $800 and I couldn't put that type of money in.  Almost worst: Off yellow Ivy Trad collegiate Vneck sweater. I thought my fall wardrobe had more things to match with it, and then I pulled out my fall wardrobe and found nothing that I would have wanted to wear with it. It would have been my first sweater of the type, so I was looking to try something new, but I just didn't see a future in the style for me.	episode_done:True
text:Best and Worst Purchases of 2020?	labels:Best: 3 tees and 2 beanies from National Athletic Goods/Homespun. The quality is just so great, the fits are awesome, and if you love neutral toned basics made in Canada these are the way to go.   Runner up: Crescent Down Works Montagne Down Parka. Was super stoked to get a down coat that was made ethically and made in the US or Japan, was able to snag this one brand new for 50% off. My only complaint is it’s a little long so my hands don’t reach the pockets perfectly but that’s really not a huge issue.  Worst: Visvim Virgil folk in suede. These were really gorgeous and I was totally star struck when I got my hands on them, was super super disappointed with how uncomfortable they are. Not that they’re objectively uncomfortable, my feet are super flat and wide so they just don’t have the arch I need. Was able to sell them the other day so all is good.	episode_done:True
text:Best and Worst Purchases of 2020?	labels:Best: I snagged an olive Mack style rain coat off of poshmark from Club Monaco and I really dig how it goes with literally everything I wear consistently. I wear suits to work and it looks unique but subtle with them. Got a great deal too.   Worst: the 4 different attempts to buy a Patagonia Better Sweater Vest from grailed/ebay. I want one in navy but keep buying ones that look dark colored in the photos but then they get in and are a medium blue. Thankful for PayPal protection on those.	episode_done:True

The full body pieces in the latter half of the album.  Except, I've actually worn those before, and having to basically undress yourself to take a crap is the most obnoxious thing ever.  It's like the opposite of functional style unless you're *actually* doing the sort of work that benefits from it, in which case you probably wouldn't use such a nice looking one for painting your house or whatever.  Some really nice coats/jackets here though, and I laughed out loud on second look when I realized the dude's sporting a "fanny pack" or belly bag or whatever you call it in number 4.  Number 9 looks a bit samey to me... I can see what it's going for, but running basically identical colors from top to bottom just looks weak to me.  I'd steal the hat though, it shows up in a few others.  Number 12 kind of gets to me, because I think it's what my dad would have looked like in his later years if he had a sense of style and some money.  The overall aesthetic reminds me of him a *lot* just better done.	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- October 21	labels:Can anyone point out wool blend differences? Seeing 60% wool with some nylon vs some wool with cashmere, some with poly and some with a mixture of all. What’s the difference between these different blends and what can anyone recommend for an overcoat ? (like a car coat). Thanks from now
text:the poly/nylon fiber is usually used as a monofilament core of the yarn which then weaved into garment.  one of the purpose is to add strength and durability to the garment at a lower cost because better wool that can be spun into weaving yarn of the same durability as synthetic blend is more expensive.  other than that, the synthetic core also adds wrinkle and shrink resistance because again, they're the core of the weaving yarn which means the wool fibers that wrap around them more or less follows the behavior of the core.  one of the negative aspect of synthetic core yarn is reduced warmth. wool fibers aren't exactly solid, it have a lot of microscopic air pockets that acts as insulator (in the same method of down filling insulates body heat). monofilament synthetic yarns don't have this, which makes it less warm.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Married dad-of-three wears skirts and heels to work ‘because he can’	labels:Nobody here commenting on how good he looks with this hybrid look. Mixing the traditionally masc shirt with the matches skirt and heels is great colour blocking and the fact that he is low key ripped helps.  Rather than using feminine clothes to add a femme edge which is pretty common he has made incredibly traditionally feminine items of clothing look very masculine on him which is kinda unique.	episode_done:True
text:Married dad-of-three wears skirts and heels to work ‘because he can’	labels:Based on everything I've ever heard from women, I don't know why you'd ever voluntarily wear stilettos. But whatever floats his boat I suppose.
text:Yeah. I low key hate this. Not for the gender non-conformity, but for perpetuating the notion that uncomfortable and restrictive clothing and high heeled shoes are aesthetically desirable for anyone.	labels:They're aesthetically desirable for the people who like them. There's an unfair pressure on women to wear them, but that's not the case here. This man is under no obligations to wear them; he does so for no other reason than he likes them. I also wear restrictive clothing and high heeled shoes. They're aesthetically desirable for me because I like how they look. But my wearing them doesn't obligate anyone else to, and I'd argue that a man wearing them doesn't contribute to the pressure on women to wear them (and that's the only pressure because there isn't one on men). There's no victim in this case, at least not the way you're framing it.	episode_done:True

As a guy who likes high heeled boots and silky shirts and racing/motorsports, makeup, musicals and woodworking and design and shooting... it’s almost like I’m two completely different people based on which of my hobbies/pastimes/etc. I’m currently engaged in. but I’m not. I can be selfish and like all these things. they can all inform part of my identity. The me thats wearing a track hoodie and a helmet and going sideways on the autocross course is the same me that’s wearing flowers and done up and belting the lyrics to frozen (frozen 2 because it’s better than the first and y’all can fight me) in the kitchen  (The fact that I only recently discovered I’m bi only adds to the contrast. oh hey look another thing I can’t choose)  But it’s a good reminder to be careful about *how* I remind people that I’m “not just X”, because it can come off exactly like you described.

text:No clue about winter wear. Please Help!	labels:Without knowing your personal style, I'd say at most for winter you only really want to invest in a nice jacket/coat and a scarf. You probably have everything else you could want for layering under it. - a nice shirt, undershirt and maybe a jumper.   Sizing wise stick with your usual size, as winter jackets are typically designed to be worn over something. You wont need to invest in something too extreme as you'll be walking the streets of Paris, not an expedition on the Artic.   Do spend a little more on the scarf though, as it can be a nice statement piece and you want it to last as well as feel nice.	episode_done:True
text:No clue about winter wear. Please Help!	labels:Paris is not that cold in winter, man, c'moon, you better check out Moscow :D    But for real, there's no need to buy a pile of clothes, you can buy one parka and a warm wool coat and wear wool sweaters and hoodies. Or buy one or two shirts with a classic wool jacket and that's enough.  Recently, I found a new brand True Classic and ordered 2 hoodies. They are really very comfortable and I'm looking forward to winter to wear them.	episode_done:True
text:No clue about winter wear. Please Help!	labels:As someone who lives in canada and has experienced -50 C days, you should also consider how much time you spend outside. If you're only time outside consists of walking from your door to the car you don't need to dress as warm as someone who has to walk 20 minutes to catch the bus.	episode_done:True
text:No clue about winter wear. Please Help!	labels:As most other commenters have already provided recommendations on coats or sweaters, I'll just touch on the layering aspect. You don't need to size up to account for layering; most base layers such as undershirts, thermal shirts or long johns are already designed to be close to the skin so you can have a dress shirt, trousers or sweater over top.   Just buy TTS and will be fine. It may seem a little snug at first but that's also to make sure you get that extra warmth.   One thing to consider is getting a beanie to protect your head from wind and the cold. This can range from Acryllic, wool blends to cashmere but really depends on your comfort level to certain materials. Some people find acryllic to be very itchy so you'll need to try a range.	episode_done:True
text:No clue about winter wear. Please Help!	labels:It comes down a lot to personal style. A dressed up look will be a lot different than a streetwear look. Consider your style and purpose of clothing and decide from there. You'll want to get pieces that are flexible as quality winter outerwear can get expensive.	episode_done:True
text:No clue about winter wear. Please Help!	labels:The fundemental key to layering is wearing soft and porous garments beneath some sort of coat or jacket that is weather resistant or less likely to let air through. Where warmth is concerned, you want to trap air between your skin and the outside. This is why winter coats like parkas have their own insulation, meant to trap warm air.	episode_done:True

text:No clue about winter wear. Please Help!	labels:I might be making assumptions from your username and post history, but if you’ll be wearing suits a lot, I recommend a wool overcoat. If not, it pretty much depends on your personal style. I like overcoats and pea coats a lot. During my time in Brussels (similar climate to Paris) I was fine with dress shirt + sweater + overcoat in winter so it’s pretty mild comparatively.
text:to piggyback, I'd say look for a fully lined midweight wool overcoat, the lining will make it easier to layer over other wool garments and help with keeping the wind out.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Denim Jacket as a Layering Piece	labels:As a mid layer, it looks forced and unnatural to me. I am curious about others thoughts, does this look good to anyone?
text:I like it, especially when worn under a longer coat.  the cropped jacket versus the longer over coat is cool to me.  Plus like, every one wears their denim jackets over a hoodie. Its been a super common look for a minute now. I think this is a good sometimes option, to try something new.   Personally, I try not to wear the same outfit more than once (although i do have fall back go-to formulas).  so if you're like me, or you just want to try something new, i think this is an option for switching things up, it gives you an other option to work with for fall.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Tips on how to master the style of HBO’s Succession?	labels:I would stick with the classics of the European heritage brands as inspiration if that Old Europe look is what you're going for. Trench coats/Macs (APC has a beige Mac this season that's decent price, Mackintosh, Burberry etc for inspiration), fine Merino wool sweaters (John Smedley makes great turtlenecks), classic tees and sweats that fit well and don't lose shape after wash (Sunspel is a good brand) and tailored trousers (this can range from Incotex, Paul Smith to some independent tailors you can find in Asia such as Yeossal, Craftsman Co. for cheaper alternatives). For shoes, I would pick well made brands like Solovair (they make the unbranded version of Doc Marten's Made in UK stuff) or Kleman's (Made in France shoes).  Main thing is that these clothes look expensive even while being simple is because they are expensive. It is not easy to go to Topman, H&M or even a Club Monaco/J. Crew to replicate that look.	episode_done:True

However, the only thing that I can find about Alpha Industries Parka sizing is on the N3-B Slim Parka and everyone on that thread seems to say that the sizes run large.

text:The Business of Markups on Logo T-Shirts. Why You Shouldn't Drop $600 on a Gucci Tee	labels:in my experience, the high end luxury brands make incredibly beautiful pieces that feel luxurious.. they often have embroidery instead of prints, heavy thick material finely woven, great cuts and designs..  i have rarely felt they are the ‘same’ as cheap clothing.  Brands like Brunello Cucinelli, Visvim, Dsquared, Valentino, Saint Laurent, Prada, Alexander McQueen, Moncler and yes even Gucci are phenomenal.  However there are brands that definitely do not feel luxurious despite their name and price:  Stone Island, Kenzo, Heron Preston, Palm Angels, Off-White and sometimes Burberry.. there are many others too..  (i’m not really speaking about t-shirts specifically but just the idea that there’s no difference between these brands and something like uniqlo is absolutely false in my experience)	episode_done:True

text:An Essay on the Navy Blazer with Brass Buttons	labels:When worn well, a navy blazer with brass buttons is absolutely killer. In general I think we harken back to the really boxy fitted blazers with the brass buttons which of course turns must of us off of the idea. Alan Flusser's shop instagram has posted some great looks with brass buttoned navy blazers (the head MTM guy, Jonathan \[I think\], is the one in the photos most of the time) and made it look ever so effortless. Us menswear geeks should rightly reconsider its place in our wardrobes, just with some updated proportions!	episode_done:True
text:An Essay on the Navy Blazer with Brass Buttons	labels:I think the brass buttons are fine when they are functional. It puts me off when the buttons are sewn in places that look like they might serve a function but are actually purely decorative. I have a full length wool military topcoat with big buttons and each button is functional even if I never use them. It can be buttoned up with 6 buttons but I usually only use 2 even in the coldest weather. I even added a couple buttons in order to button down the corners of the lapels. The quarter belt in the back has the same big buttons. I frequently get compliments on my coat as I've customized it quite a bit.	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - October 19	labels:Looking into my crystal ball, predictions for the future of fashion:  Like, 10 years from now some dumb brand is going to try to pull a Margiela on "MAGA" hats and appropriate them as part of a seasonal collection, altering them to turn them into a different piece, like painting the logo across the front so that it partly covers the text. The collection will largely be shot down as "too soon."  On the flipside though like 25 years from now I could imagine edgy hipsters appropriating them as their own form of "ironic" fashion. Ageing millennials will condemn it as inappropriate but the youth culture will only cling to it harder as being "subversive," in part perhaps because they don't fully grasp the cultural context of the late 2010s, a period they weren't even alive during.
