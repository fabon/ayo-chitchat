I also love the PJ set long sleeve version. \\n\\nNot silk, not gauze, but infinitely washable -- my very first purchase is 4 or 5 years old now and I've washed it every week and it still looks brand new, no piling, no stretching, no fading. It holds up to its claim and you can wear over and over again without getting stanky. I say this as someone who's been wearing this brand since I was perimenopausal and had hot flashes. \\n\\nThe second skin nightie is cut in a way that is super flattering--- but so are the Pj's which i am basically living in since COVID. I just sleep too hot so the PJ's are for day and the nightie is for night.\\n\\nI did give the Lilly Silk Pj's a try but they don't stretch at all and just weren't as flattering or as comfortable.\\n\\nI tried Lunya as well but I'm 5'0 and they were designed for very slim and tall people.\",\n",

I believe natural fibres are less likely to pill too?\\n\\nWashing clothes inside out so they're less likely to rub against each other in the wash will help too. \\n\\nThen fabric shavers as a last resort.

Pilling, in general.\\n- **Leggings:** in the crotch area, elastic fibers work their way out of the fabric.  \\n- **T-shirts:** stitching comes apart at the armpit.\\n- **All fabrics:** color fading.\\n- **Stretchy fabrics:** overstretching can cause the stitching at hems and seams to snap.\\n\\nI try to minimize stitching failures by putting *everything* into mesh bags for the washing machine.  Sometimes that causes clumping, leading to a weight imbalance such that the spin cycle fails, though.\",\n",

I wash on cold, gentle, and tumble dry on the lowest heat setting for as short a time as possible. I've washed them since and no other buttons have fallen off fwiw. Bought off AliExpress for $18 and I'm very pleased with the quality otherwise. Probably could've superglued the button back on, but was too lazy to be bothered.\\n\\n* Print on a $40 tshirt (I bought off AliExpress) stuck together in the wash and ripped/peeled off the shirt when I tried to separate it. I had worn it 3-4 times, so not happy with the cost per wear.\\n\\n* The pattern on faux leather Alo yoga pants has rubbed off after about a year of use. The seams are fine (and I love Alo's quality wrt athletic use), but the ass and thighs are rubbed shiny. If you want faux leather, don't spend more than $50 on the bottoms because the pattern will eventually rub off and you'll be sad. Pants themselves have held up wonderfully after 3 years of wear without any distortion to the seams or loss of elasticity to the material.\\n\\n* After ten years, the elastic on one of my Nike shorts grew brittle and broke apart in the waistband. I have similar pairs of shorts purchased around the same time that haven't done this yet, so I assume it's a combination of old age and frequency of wear.\\n\\n* (This is likely a feature and not a bug of the material) Allsaints angora sweater pilled and shrunk after one wash. Easy to fix with a sweater shaver, but no longer fuzzy af. I stretched it back out when it was still wet, so the shape was easy to restore.\",\n",

      "            \"body\": \"I usually find that things lose shape or the fabric becomes very thin. I have a shirt in mind that not only went from fitted to being more shapeless and the fabric became noticeably thinner. It wasn't like it became paper thin overnight but beforehand I went from where I could wear any color bra to having to think about what color I wanted to put underneath. Additionally the shirt became baggier around the shoulders, less fitted through the waist. I've had shirts become bigger, even when they started baggy. Certain material just feels like it isn't meant to last long term, especially more trend type pieces. Other shirts I have begin to pile, particularly in areas like the underarms though if it's a knit it may not be just the underarm.  Some clothes I feel like I can baby all day long, they will still break down. \\n\\nI've had my share of seams coming loose as well, the strings either breaking altogether to make a hole or just not holding as well. Interestingly this has happened to me with clothes all over the price spectrum, so I like to think it's not a specific issue with a brand or material. It's a quality issue, simple as that.  \\n\\nWith jeans another person mentioned the butt sagging thing too and I notice that a lot as well. Skinny jeans tend to be where I notice this the most but that may be because I expect them to be tighter fitting than others. I can usually get around this issue by rotating jeans out and washing them then air drying but sometimes with older jeans they aren't able to be saved from this. \\n\\nI do air dry a lot of things in comparison to my friends I find. Due to my fears of shrinking every jacket, all bras, pants, leggings and sweaters are all air dry only. I still have issues with clothes wearing out quicker than I would like, but I think it mostly boils down to quality and materials sometimes, rather than user error.\",\n",

They don't wear out so much as get old. I threw away a pair that looked great, but the rubber on the sole was so old it got hard and hurt my feet. \\n\\nCanvas white sneaks, things like eyelets pulling out and getting too grungy to wear in public.\\n\\nPlain white socks...my common sock. I can destroy the heel portion in no time flat in the summer.\\n\\nCotton tees don't wear out; they just get comfier and comfier until there's nothing left.\\n\\nMy success to bras/undies longevity is to have a lot of them and rotate wearing them. Bras I cold soak in the sink and drip dry. They last eons this way unless the underwire decides to liberate itself.\\n\\nSweaters is the same story. I have many and rotate wearing them. Fancy ones don't get worn too often so they tend to last pretty well.\\n\\nOpaque tights pill at the feet despite wearing socks and they lose their snap and get baggy at the ankles.\\n\\nPantyhose are barely worth mentioning because they wear out sitting by themselves unworn, but the reinforced toe ends giving out is common after a bit of time. Most common cause of destruction is on the sides during hoisting them up. One second of complacency means a thumb goes right through them. The lycra on older nylons gives out too.\\n\\nAge is there, too. I had a big red hoodie from HS that I had for eons, but the material got crumbly from age. :(\\n\\nGlasses aren't clothes, but they are worth mentioning. My favorite style has a single bridge that tends to snap in two after 3 years. I learned this the hard way once. I had that pair and a pair of awful looking giant plastic ones. I was gently cleaning the lenses and SNAP! *gasp*. I had to wear my cheapo ones for 10+ days and I got tired of Bailey Quarters jokes. Now, I have so many glasses (Thanks, Zenni) that a broken pair isn't an issue. I do remember the snap and the dread I felt knowing I'd be functionally blind and uncomfortable for almost two weeks.\",\n",

I try to shave the pills off and that creates tiny holes.\\n\\nI am a stain machine. I don't know how I do it but when I pull daily basic cotton shirts out of the dryer there is always a stain like a 6 year old. My best guess is that I am spilling ice tea on myself. I don't do this in my nicer blouses that I am more attentive in.\\n\\nHard water turns my whites dingy fast. That and deodorant stains. When I oxy clean the crap out of whites the harsh chemicals break down the fabric and the piece will fall apart. I treat whites as disposable and will not spend a lot of money on white items.\\n\\nMy nice coats all have different issues. One was an Anthropolgie coat and the thread just rotted and fell apart at the seams. Other coats had faux leather trim or were completely faux leather, and that material rotted away. One wool coat got too many pills for my taste.\\n\\nCardigan sweaters become misshapen. They get all saggy and flare out in the fitted area. Yuck. I go from sexy secretary to frumpy church lady. I get bored of older pullover sweaters and stop caring about their worth, so I stain them eventually.\\n\\nDresess tend to hold up the best for me. Because it is a dress I tend to be more careful then if I am wearing a casual jean outfit. So less stains, rips, etc. Also, it doesn't stretch out over time like pants do. I dry clean after a few wears or machine wash/ line dry so they last a long time and do not shrink. I have started buying more dresses for this reason. Dresses also have better resale value then skirts/pants if I want to resale.\\n\\nBras with wires poke through. And shoes become unglued.\\n\\nMy tricks so far..Splurge on one neutral (black for me) and that one color that makes you pop (light purples for me). Then get disposal stuff that you need but just doesn't last no matter how much you pay. For me that is white. It doesn't matter if I buy a 300 silk blouse. It will eventually get stained by me, I know because I did this already. It is better to get 5 $10 crisp white cotton tops every year. If I stain it, oh well. I use those stain tops for cleaning rags after.\",\n",
