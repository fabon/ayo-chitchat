They likely buy inexpensive things at first and either don't link to it, or focus on another part of the picture to talk about. Then they sell the item, give it away, or otherwise dispose of it after it's not trendy anymore. \\n\\n---Influencing isn't just about having the latest expensive name brands. People want to follow someone who looks like a slightly better, but achievable version of them. So hipsters follow someone who has a great eye for vintage. Bougie housewife types follow someone who always looks \\\"done\\\" to the nines. Slow fashion people follow someone doing a \\\"333\\\" or \\\"slow fashion week\\\". \\n\\n---There is a same-same-y ness to many IG brands right now and fresh voices and looks would be welcome. There's room for all styles. Finding cute looks at the thrift store, or posing in the same dress every week for a year and talking about your journey and lessons learned, or learning to make all your own clothing, or doing a \\\"no buy\\\" or \\\"low buy\\\" etc could be a very welcome change from Chanel Boy bags and Valentino RockStuds and Starbucks. \\n\\n---The sheer quality of the clothing doesn't always \\\"read\\\" on camera. It does help, but speaking perfectly frankly, an 18 year old with glowing skin, a slender/toned body and great hair can make the cheapest clothing look great and someone who is \\\"just average\\\" won't really look like an \\\"influencer\\\" in head to toe designer. For an influencer, it's the body, the hair, the face, the skin, the poses, the cute locations, the captions, the engagement she has with fans, the whole lifestyle she's selling, not just the clothes. It would be better to be doing a \\\"picture taken from behind with BF holding my hand walking forward\\\" in Target clothes and SheIn shoes than a full head to toe designer in a bland, suburban condo in a closet mirror.\",\n",
