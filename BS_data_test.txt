text:Winter staples?	labels:Thick, tall (just under butt cheeks) leg warmers. mine are wool and they are such an amazing layering piece that allows me to feel warm without wearing 5 different layers of pants that feel all tight around my belly.  Also, a leather 'vest' type top. I love adding this over some of my layers because it's windproof, keeps my torso warm without adding more layers of sleeves, and the way it fits sort of cinches in all those layers I'm wearing to help define my waist	episode_done:True
text:How much of your income do you spend on average in clothes every month?	labels:I don't keep a clothing budget but spend from my "discretionary funds" budget each month. So like if I want to buy a new dress, I'm giving up a few meals out that month etc. It's kind of that "put your money towards what you enjoy most" kind of thing! Also new clothes every season sounds kind of tiresome TT Just shop within your means and when you see something you adore, I think! ^.^

text:I want to eliminate the need for dry cleaning my work wardrobe. Sadly, anything nice seems incompatible with machine wash. What long lasting, work pieces have been easiest for you to maintain?	labels:Women’s clothing being made from cheap “wash n toss” fabric is the bane of the environment. And my closet! If you really want to go dry clean free, I would find a good seamstress in the neighborhood (ask around on NextDoor), and consult with her. Look thorough sewing patterns for a “wardrobe pattern” that has trousers, pencil skirt, dress and jackets, and have her make them up, fully lined for longer wear. And start building a wardrobe of nice washable blouses & dressy t-shirts. It will cost a bit- but if you make them in a good poly/cotton twill, you can wash them in gentle cycle, weekly, put them on “low” in the dryer and remove them still damp to finish drying on a hanger- and they will last years.	episode_done:True

text:What are some of your least favourite brands?	labels:Zara, Perry Ellis, Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger, Michael Kors, H&M, Urban Outfitters, Steve Madden... obnoxious crap. You'll spent 2/3rds the price of quality clothing and will be 1/100th as satisfied with it. It won't fit right, feel right, look right, or last long.  Give me a Pendleton canvas jacket, LL Bean sweater, W&B Selvedge, and Red Wings. Will be 3X as expensive upfront, but I will be wearing it 6 years later - and the boots, jeans, and jacket will look even better with wear. It's a difference of 500 wears versus 10, especially when you take into account that shit clothes do not look very good so you will eventually resell or give it away.
text:I generally agree but I do get some basics from h&m on sale for like $10-20 that I feel are worth to fit a limited (albeit potentially short) role in my wardrobe.	labels:I get that. I had a period in my early twenties where I purchased brands like H&M and others from goodwill and buffalo. And I got good use. I was too poor to put the upfront money into alternatives, and I wanted to look good for dates and interviews immediately, haha!  My perspective changed a bit; I started thinking about the impacts of my consumption. And it bothers me that fast fashion is so wasteful.

I also had a super elaborate teal satin princess gown one year, but she made it to go over my snowsuit (Canada...) so I was more like the Michelin Man than royalty in the end. Having to dress for freezing and snow really puts a damper on kids’ costumes up here.

text:General Discussion - October 20	labels:Just how strong is the Tesla koolaid?  "Tesla admits design flaw led to vehicle rear bumper falling off when driving in puddles of water"  You make luxury vehicles. Get the basics right and stop living in a Clarke and Dawe sketch, you drugged up weirdo.  But some of the comments in the [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/ht8m0b/tesla_model_3_rear_bumper_falling_off_issue_more/) on r/electricvehicles:  > If it's 1 in 100,000 chance, and there is no safety consequences - then service center is ok.  I'd say the bumper falling off when it gets wet is a *slight* safety issue.  > Anecdotal, but I've driven my 2018 Model 3 through two very large pools of water last year. No issues in general from that surprisingly.   TWO whole puddles? Well someone please give Mr. Musk his gold star.  > I can’t imagine many owners would go to the shop to get this changed out. I know I wouldn’t...waste of time.  A bigger waste of time than having to replace the ass end of the car after a little mist?  > My early 2020 model 3 bumper has visible gaps in the rear bumper that were not there on delivery. Like it's slowly getting pulled off. Tesla service tech told me it's normal defiation  Just...wow  > I would still take a Tesla with its QC issues over they comparable ICE vehicle.  To each their own, but personally I value my car arriving at its destination in one piece over method of propulsion.  This is early Kia level quality from a brand that wants to be considered exclusive and innovative; at least Hyundai and Kia made amends with a great warranty. And people are seemingly unbothered with having their $50,000+ car fall apart on them in completely normal driving conditions.

But my darling husband split up with her anyway and we were immediately rewarded with a beautiful healthy daughter. So anyway, the other day she finally died and out of respect (yes, nothing but respect) my hubby and I decided to wear yellow, which is a mourning colour in her native country Spain. But it's also a colour of celebration here in England and now some people are calling me an asshole for celebrating that the old hag died and no one can contest the legitimacy of my children anymore. Anyway, AITA for being respectful?

text:General Discussion - December 13, 2020	labels:I hope nobody takes this comment as me being an asshole, because I’m intending this to be more of a constructive criticism than that.  But honestly, as someone whose style kind of stagnated somewhere in the mid 2010s, I kind of feel like this sub isn’t very helpful for updating my style, because the sub also refuses to catch up with what’s fashionable.  Like streetwear has obviously captured the zeitgeist for quite a while now. That’s always been an element of my wardrobe. But I feel like I could do better to expand my style and have more options and just in general better embrace trends and incorporate them into my own personal style.  But for the most part this sub isn’t really interested in keeping up. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not expecting this sub to start going crazy for box logos or Supreme or dress like a futuristic cartoon character, if I was interested in that I would actually just read r/streetwear. But I do wish some of the recurring threads and users could offer some inspo in terms of tasteful, grown up streetwear outfits and things like that. But from my perception, MFA is still stuck in early 2010s menswear, J. Crew inspired Americana, or just outright standard business casual. Which is *fine*, it doesn’t look bad, but it’s certainly not fashionable anymore and despite that the default male fashion sub won’t look beyond it, largely.  EDIT: People have been asking me for examples, here’s some stuff that I’ve liked lately, I don’t know that most or any of this is what you’d call “streetwear” but it’s more in the direction of what I’m talking about   Thom Yorke is one of my consistently favorite style inspo sources, he pulls off a pretty good hybrid of tasteful streetwear and classic menswear style I think.  I like this kind of fit he’s worn a lot of the last couple years:   (Actually can’t find the exact pic I’m looking for here so I’ll try my best here)  https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/theoaklandpress.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/1/4b/14bc5350-f6ff-11e8-8bd7-83eb124e2f8a/5c052f56b8ad2.image.jpg?resize=1200%2C800  Usually coupled with one of these Undercover jackets like this:  https://static.stereogum.com/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1161546807-1570042584-compressed.jpg  I think one of the pieces he wears a lot are the Acne Ryder pants, which I kind of like as hybrid classic menswear combined with a more informal, streetwear adjacent vibe:  https://www.nordstrom.com/s/acne-studios-ryder-slim-fit-pants/5146319  I also like Acne in general and I wish I could afford some of these jeans to work into some outfits I have kicking around in my head:  https://www.acnestudios.com/us/en/max-blue-black/B00146-AIL.html?categid=man-jeans  I also like Daniel Lopatin aka Oneohtrix Point Never’s style as well, who I’d say does kind of a more tasteful streetwear thing as well. This press pic is a nice example:  https://dazedimg-dazedgroup.netdna-ssl.com/1400/azure/dazed-prod/1230/9/1239834.jpg  More OPN with bonus Safdie brother: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DOn1aXWWsAAeZSC.jpg  I also like these black denim jackets, chore jackets kind of thing. I have a good Rag & Bone one that I’ve gained too much weight to wear, but these 3sixteen and Rogue Territory ones are nice too and along those lines:  https://www.3sixteen.com/collections/outerwear/products/type-3s-denim-jacket-lightweight-double-black   https://www.rogueterritory.com/collections/jackets/products/supply-jacket-stealth-black?variant=5415637057568  Also along these lines, this Carhartt WIP jacket: https://stagprovisions.com/collections/carhartt-wip/products/carhartt-wip-modular-jacket-ss18  In general I like the use of black/muted or monochromatic colors, I like the idea of drawing influence from punk/hardcore style because I’m into that as well, but I haven’t figured out exactly how to make that work. Also for that reason, I’d like to replace my Red Wings with a pair of Docs, I like the rougher around the edges style better.  I’m gonna trying to keep editing this post, Reddit is kinda fucking up on my phone.

And I think that trends come and go faster than they used to, because of the internet. With social media, people have exposure to a greater variety of styles and they can easily purchase those styles online.

text:Vogue: How Thom Browne Is Flourishing in a Pandemic (& a fun anecdote on staying true to one's self)	labels:>Browne told me that he likes to be entertaining and takes pleasure in pressing people’s buttons, particularly when it comes to the length of men’s trousers and sleeves. “I want to provoke some reaction,” he says. “I don’t want people to just like what I do. I want them to maybe hate it.”  I think this is a great way to look at it. I remember reading the previous post you linked and I think he has the right approach in tailoring his clothes in a way that they stand out. There's personality in his cuts and silhouettes. I remember when the the Cleveland Cavaliers all wore Thom Browne to the NBA finals. I thought they all looked quite dapper. I expect to see Odell Beckham Jr in more Thom Browne(I think he wore a TB kilt to met gala 2 years ago?)   I guess I'll go against the FFA grain and say i'm not surprised that Thom Browne is doing well? There's only so much loungewear and athleisure that we can take as consumers and fashion lovers. He presents a refreshing take what it means to look "polished" and well put together in a suit.  I'm also still not ashamed to admit I want a Hector & Mrs. Thom calfskin bag  EDIT: I am digging all of the [white](https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2021-ready-to-wear/thom-browne/slideshow/collection) in the SS21 RTW.

text:People like to hate on landlords but real estate has historically been a great investment and I can't really fault people for wanting to make money.   The circle that needs to be squared is that you can't have both affordable housing/housing as a right and housing as an investment avenue. Those things are basically mutually exclusive.   There's also a big difference between renting out a couple of rooms or having a few small properties locally that you maintain and the massive international corporations that buy up everything. But both are landlords.	labels:Post is calling out NYC landlords who have a pretty long history of charging super high prices on rents and are evicting people during a pandemic   Really wish I had enough dough to drop on a “great investment” but I’m busting my ass at work to live in an apartment owned by a guy who sits on hiss ass for a passive income. Housing should be a human right and these dudes are sitting on dozens of empty apartments cause they’d rather have people out in the cold than drop rental prices.

A bit on the pricier side but they actually have tall and super tall (I think) inseams. Their sizing is a bit weird though, I think I went down two sizes from the size I thought I was so I’d recommend going to a store to try on before buying. Another brand with tall sizing is Banana Republic, I have a pair of jeans I love from there but they are almost too short for me so they may not work for your niece but might for some others!   Lululemon has tall length leggings but again those are pricy. I don’t usually mind short leggings anymore since 7/8 length has came into style (thank goodness)  Tops and jackets are hardest for me, I haven’t found a brand that consistently makes long enough arms yet. One trick I’ve found though is that if a top has thumb holes, you can sew those up and it fits like a regular long sleeve!   Also partially commenting because I’d love to see what everyone else has to add!

Flared jeans were still being worn, low-rise denim was good. There were woolen newsboy hats during fall and winter. There was a semi-trend of silky camis and satin bustier corset tops being worn to "da clubs", closely aligned with another trend of tops inspired by jennifer lopez' versace grammy dress, under which you'd wear a strapless tube bra. There was also a really annoying trend of the elastic hemmed bubble dress and long tops, which were so hard to iron. H&M came to Canada in 2005 and had a lot of 50s and 60s inspired tweed. It was a lot at once, honestly, I'm more excited about the Instagram interpretation of it.

Synopsis on Kanopy:   A landmark 1992 film, Framing Lesbian Fashion looks at the evolution of lesbian attire and identity -butch/femme, flannel, androgyny, cross-dressing and drag, queer fluorescent, S/M and leather, lipstick and more. Featuring interviews with Sally Gearhart, JoAnn Loulan, Arlene Stein, Kitty Tsui and others, Framing Lesbian Fashion incorporates archival photos and personal stories to document the sociology and history of lesbian fashion as it existed in the early 90s, and still impacts the culture today.

text:Totally.  To me, Gen Z is a lot of clothing that isn’t work appropriate but super fun. A lot of crop tops, bra tops, spaghetti straps, usually some tummy showing, and then some baggy pants. Lots of thrifting and also cheap fast fashion. Doc Martens and other platform shoes. Very 90s/early 2000s. Long acrylic nails, false lashes. Really fun and can be a really “hot but trashy” style   Millennial fashion is more professional/better quality/structured. Linens, trousers, heels, sandals, etc. Frankly I think it has to do with millennials having more money. Low key hair, nails and makeup. Neutral colours and patterns. It’s a more mature style   I’m 25 so I get to do both 😎 woohoo	labels:[deleted]	episode_done:True
text:Is fast fashion really fast fashion if you get years of use out of the garments?	labels:I've thought about this a lot too. I have tops that I bought at Primark for $3 seven years ago that are still in perfect condition. I think the emphasis should be on reducing consumption. There's a level of classism that comes with environmental movements as well because low income, immigrant households may not use as many "sustainable" products but they buy fewer products overall and reuse/fix everything because they have to save money.
text:Fast fashion articles always seem to include quotes from people who supposedly buy things for a night out and then bin them as though that's the main market for these clothes. But I've never met anyone who does that. When I did most of my shopping in Primark it was because that was all I could afford, not because I wanted to buy 10 bad quality t shirts for the cost of 1 good one so that I could throw them away. I bought one bad quality t shirt and I wore it until it fell apart, and if you'd told me to my face I was a bad person for making one of the very few choices available to me I wouldn't have reacted well.  (A decade on I still have some of those rubbish t shirts because, actually, being made of plastic crap means they're pretty indestructible.)  There's a lot of talk here about buying second hand which I think also misses a class issue: there is a massive stigma in working class communities about buying second hand, at least in the UK. Buying someone else's cast offs because it's the only way you can afford to clothe yourself is very different from doing it because you're making a conscious choice to do something for the environment - it's basically an admission of defeat. I've got very little time for the idea that we should solve the problems of capitalism by putting extra burdens on the poorest in society.	labels:I also don’t understand where these people who claim they thrift everything actually shop. Unless you live in a trendy city all you’re going to find in a charity shop is a bunch of ill-fitting, dated, frumpy shit. It’s a big neon sign that shouts to the world someone isn’t financially well off.   American thrift shops seem the same. When I watch YouTubers do these thrift hauls 9 times out of 10 everything looks so tired and frumpy. There’s a reason the items were donated. Like you said, it’s other people’s cast offs, if the item was any good it’D probably still be in that person’s wardrobe. Most people don’t replace their wardrobes every year. There’s also something quite dehumanising about expecting people less financially well off to dig through piles of rubbish to find one passable item and be grateful for it.    Meanwhile for a little more you can go to Primark or sites like Boohoo or Missguided and get something much better that actually looks good, functions just as well, comes in your size and you can retain some semblance of a personal style which is better for a person’s confidence and even their mental health. On top of that “everyone” shops at these places so it doesn’t scream your financial status and people with more limited funds aren’t going to be the ones buying the fast fashion stop in 10 different colours so they aren’t even contributing to the problems associated with fast fashion in the first place.	episode_done:True
text:Have you ever gone out on a limb and bought clothing from an unknown brand advertised on Instagram/Facebook/online? How did it work out?	labels:I casually browse AliExpress when I'm really bored, so I've got a really good eye for catching dropshipped products. This is why the only fast fashion sites I tend to use are SHEIN when their items are on sale. I've only bought 1 full price item from them because it had super good reviews.    Other than that SHEIN is basically dropshipped clothing that I *could* buy from AliExpress, but after shipping fees it would be about the same price and would take a month or more to arrive if it doesn't get flagged in Customs.	episode_done:True
text:All-time favorite cold weather pieces?	labels:I have an unusually high tolerance for cold except for my ears. Ear protection recs? Oddly hard to find cute hats with ear flaps, and all the headscarves I’ve tried aren’t actually warm.

text:What's your fashion tragedy?	labels:In high school I had a Beatles shirt that I looooved. It wasn’t anything that would exactly go on this sub, but it was bright and funky. It was bright yellow and had rainbow rhinestones and a pop-art style print of the Beatles on it. I wore yellow and blue eye shadow with it and thought I looked fabulous, hahaha. And then I got a new black shirt later, and washed it with the rest of my clothes. When I pulled my yellow Beatles shirt out of the wash, there were gigantic black splotches on it!!! Nothing I did took them off, so I had to get rid of the shirt.   About 10 years later, I’m working in a lab, and one of the students comes in WEARING THE SHIRT!!! I flipped out and asked where she got it, she said goodwill. I told her the story. The next day, on my desk was a gift bag with the shirt in it! I felt bad and said I didn’t want to just take her shirt, but she insisted. And now I have my funky shirt back :)
text:Was it THE same shirt, like with the black still on it or was it another of the exact same shirt? I once donated a scarf I knitted to a thrift store and five years later ran into a woman wearing it at a bus station. She’d gotten it as a gift from her friend who had gotten it from a church flea market so who knows how many hands it passed through between me and her!	labels:It was a different one, I just tossed the shirt with the black splotches because it was a lost cause, it looked terrible.

text:What inspired your passion/love for fashion?	labels:From ages 10 to 20, I used to believe I was 100% transgender. I only wore boy's clothing, had super messy hair, absolutely hated anything girly. Then, one day, I was outed by my "well-meaning" friend. I was absolutely horrified and the label suddenly just didn't sit right with me anymore. The thought of having to dress and act a sudden way now that people knew about the "real me" just felt awful.   A few months later, I started buying tons of dresses and very feminine clothes just to get rid of the label. I started to love experimenting with outfits and noticed how they weren't all that influenced by my gender identity, even though I still experienced dysphoria and the feeling that my mind and body did not belong together. Clothing was just fun to me, a kind of theater, maybe some form of drag even.  Nowadays, at 24, I have started identifying as genderqueer instead and everything has just fallen into place. I still wear my dresses, but I'm finally comfortable again in menswear as well - and I have to admit it's a lot more me, but I just don't think it's as fun as some kind of colourful twirly dress!   So in a way, embracing my gender identity to its fullest was in the end what made me love fashion. :)	episode_done:True

text:What is your ideal first date outfit?	labels:Warm weather: I love to wear a colorful sundress with a nude short heel, and focus more on my accessories (just earrings and a shawl). If it's more casual, I like rompers and switch the heels for nice flats. I LOVE rompers because I can get the silhouette of a little dress/skirt but can remain more active. One of my favorite early dates with my boyfriend was going to the arcade in the summer, and the romper outfit was perfect for that.   Cold weather: I've been big on corduroy the last couple years, I have a couple of cute corduroy dresses I love to style with chunky sweaters and warm tights. If it's really cold, I switch to corduroy pants with a simple fluffy turtleneck. I have a pair of Timberlands, the mono black ones with the velvet cuff and velvet laces, and they look a little nicer but are still practical in the snow.   I also have pretty long hair, and that's my favorite accessory honestly- I think your hairstyle can really set the mood for a date. This spring/summer I was really big on a single braid, pinned to the side, with a ribbon or scarf braided in with the hair. It was super easy to do but it really dresses up a more casual fit. Also hair forks!! I've been having a lot of fun playing with those for an updo that looks really nice, but is so simple and easy.
text:I ADORE hair forks. GACarver on etsy makes my favorite ones, mini diamond shape ended two prongs. It doesn’t look like a wooden spoon in my hair and they are luxuriously smooth.	labels:Ooh thank you, I'm gonna add that one to my list! I have one with a crescent moon shape carved at the top from sdwshop on Etsy, and it's so cute. I also have a really dainty copper one by Two Feathers Jewelry on Etsy, that one is so tiny and sweet and goes with anything!	episode_done:True

Where is the best place to get a suit? Which material is the best? I was thinking linen or cotton but I have no experience with suits, and he doesn’t either. What exactly do I say to a tailor once we do get the suit? Are there any shunned additions (pockets, lapel sizes, etc)? I would honestly just like advice and information.

text:I suggest not ordering on meranom. I saw they have the 1967 anivversary model for about 400$. You can buy it for 175 Euros on Vostok-Watches24(dot)com. Delivery time takes very long though - about 2-3 weeks.  There is also a company that is called "VOSTOK EUROPE" - but that is a different company, which is more expensive and does not use the same indestructible mechanism.     There is also the AM-Diver Shop, which makes custom VOSTOKS. The adress is "am-diver(dot)de".	labels:The 1967 model Vostok-Watches24 sells and  the one Meranom sells are two different watches. The ones on Meranom are the real deal and the ones on Vostok-Watches24 are essentially mods with a huge markup. You can buy the parts yourself and build the watch for less than 100€, easily. Everything on Vostok-Watches24 is at least 20-25% more expensive than on Meranom or Komandirskie.com.

text:Paging /u/TheVirt : do you know where I can find quality 5 button sleeveless cardigans apart from Drake's ? I know the Armoury does some, but they're merino, Bryceland's are awesome but I'm in Europe and customs taxes are expensive af.  Looks like O'Connells do the same as Drake's but I'm not sure of the fit ?	labels:Not many that I know of, unfortunately. You'll have to pay a premium for the unique design. Drake's would be the easiest to find, and multiple places stock it like Trunk Clothiers, etc.   You've probably come across Ethan's [article](https://streetxsprezza.wordpress.com/2018/01/04/drakes-and-the-sleeveless-cardigan/) on those cardigans. Lambswool is nice for texture, but merino might work better for layering imo. Maybe look into John Smedley too, and I think I might have seen one by Scott & Charters floating around. I do think that if the fit is something you're concerned about though, paying the little premium to get something you know works is the better way about it.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else not factor in pants when creating outfits? How to move away from this?	labels:I am on the opposite of this scale! I own more types of pants than tops. My tops are therefore mostly clean cut and goes together with everything and I spice up my outfit with a cool pair of pants instead!  You can try taking your outfit a step further with pants. Say you want to look professional and you wear a white shirt with your blue jeans. Try a pair of black jeans or tailored wool slacks instead. Say it’s nice weather outside and you wear a halter top with your blue jeans. Try a pair of culottes or palazzo pants instead.  Another aspect is balancing your outfit. Maybe you want something skinny-fit on top, this looks great with a pair of more voluminous pants. Maybe you want something oversized or flowy on top, this looks great with a pair of skinny pants. Maybe you want flared pants, or tapered?  Pants are my favourite and there are endless possibilities :)	episode_done:True

I bought some tobacco brown faux suede skinny Good American jeans and I’m trying to figure out what to pair with them.	labels:I just googled those jeans and they’re going straight onto my wish list. I reckon a modern cowboy vibe - black western blouse, denim jacket (possibly with shearling), boots with western details (not necessarily cowboy boots but ankle boots with detailing, probably would go black over brown). Or a turtleneck (either black or a white one in a soft/cozy fabric), long grey/beige coat, knee high stiletto boots, big freshly blow dried hair.	episode_done:True
text:What are your thoughts on outfit repeating multiple days in a row?	labels:I wear the exact same five outfits every week and have for the past year or two.

I get variety without buying lots of clothes, and I end up wearing the same peices most of the time.

text:How much was your most expensive fashion item and when or how often do you wear it?	labels:my most expensive item’s value is around $1600-1800 (i can’t remember). it’s a lamb skin jacket. i wear it whenever i want and just take care not to rub up against anything lol. i agree w other commenters—why spend money on something you’re not going to wear? unless it’s speicifically special occasion like a wedding dress or suit.  just dropping by w a tip: no need to buy high quality things at full price. buy second hand from the real real, sample sales, vestiaire, posh, mercari, depop, consignment, and occasional thrift. you are helping keep clothes in circulation before hitting the landfill and are removing demand from supply chain for a new product. plus since it’s high quality you can be sure that it will last a long time since it’s been with others and still looks great.  also putting in the research and work towards being able to purchase something will show yourself you truly love it and deserve it. this will help stop buying things on a whim. a lot of things ppl regret buying were bought on a whim.	episode_done:True

Heel or no heel?
text:Pardon me if im misunderstanding, but a loafer with no heel is likely a driver or a slipper, both pretty casual but doable with ocbd and chinos.

text:What's your fashion tragedy?	labels:We had a moth infestation over COVID. Normally it wouldn’t have happened, but suddenly we both stopped our suit-wearing office jobs and put all of our wool dress clothes, blazers, cashmere sweaters etc. away in a dark corner of our walk-in closet starting in March.   Then by the time we saw a moth flying around in July, the moths had already eaten holes in several items. They love the expensive stuff - cashmere, wool suits, wool coats. Our cheapie casual stuff? Our polyester athleisure? Ha, hard pass and straight for the Max Mara jacket. It cost ~ two thousand dollars in damage (two of my husband’s suits, one of mine, one dress, 3 dress pants, 3 cashmere sweaters, a wool coat); drycleaning, moth prevention and extermination combined. And it took an amazing amount of time - we had to move everything out of our closet, wash, freeze, bake and/or dryclean everything, then I probably purchased every single not-too-toxic pest control item known to man (incl. some moderately toxic bug bombs which we then had to air out our home for a few days). I think I spent about $120 just on garment bags alone. Then the buggers moved to our other closet and we repeated that process for the entry way closet. Finally had the exterminator come twice and it seems to be under control.  Quite honestly a two month nightmare, and no, not covered by homeowners insurance. We managed to get two holes rewoven (a very high level highly technical skill that only very good tailors know how to do and was $60 per hole) on two peices. I learned how to darn and fix holes in looser knits and weaves like sweaters. But god. It was so horrible.  My husband had particularly expensive stuff affected, but actually I lost more because I had more things that were just in the realm of “is this worth $60 to repair and $20 to dry clean?” and ended up deciding no on a few of them so ended up tossing. Also one of my cashmere sweaters, though not cheap, was honestly beyond repair.

So just wait and see what your coworkers wear, and choose what you’re comfortable in. If you’re on the manufacturing side (rather than design) there’s no pressure at all to look fashion forward. I wouldn’t really care what you’re dressed like, only that you know what you’re talking about.   I still do the same job, but now I’m fully remote so I also only wear hoodies.

text:BoF: J. Crew's New CEO has a Survival Plan: Edit out the Ugly	labels:Middle-aged person here and copping to my age only because it legit adds context:  I was in high school when I started getting the J. Crew catalog, in the late 1980s. [Linda Evangelista was one of the models](https://silklacewool.tumblr.com/post/163833033703/barbiescanner-j-crew-1989-linda-evangelista), right as she was beginning her career, which should give you an idea of the time period; she had her little mushroom haircut and I remember her in a long-sleeved t-shirt and, like, flannel pajama shorts.  For a lot of Gen Xers like me, the appeal to J. Crew in those days rested in two things: the quality *and the styling in the catalog* \-- they'd do layouts which were capsule wardrobe before capsule was a thing, they'd show [women wearing the men's clothing in cute ways](https://nibsblog.wordpress.com/2010/01/19/menswear-for-women-1994/), and they'd emphasize [the standards you could expect to see season after season](https://assets.vogue.com/photos/59f371a211143b4f8402f7da/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/06-jcrew-reissues.jpg). So if you couldn't afford the barn jacket out of your allowance in 1989, you could rest assured it would still be there in 1990.  (I still have two barn jackets from 1991, plus a lovely guava-pink cotton v-neck tee I bought in summer 1993 and a roll-neck sweater from 1995; the only reason I don't have two fantastic ribbed merino v-necks from 1998 is because the moths got to them in 2011 while I was distracted on maternity leave.)  That catalog was a really effective piece of marketing because you could come back to it again and again, and absorb [a particular type of preppy-but-cooler presentation](https://theculturetrip.com/north-america/usa/articles/90s-nostalgia-prep-school-chic-and-the-j-crew-catalogue/) from it.  For the girls in my college dorms, Catalog Day was a big deal. We'd get together and read through and comment on the styles and assess how it would all work with the stuff we already had.  The catalog is gone, the website now offers far fewer styling inspirations and there's way too much stuff. And that's not even getting into the quality issues or the pricing.  The brand is unappealing to the people who used to be its core constituency; there's no value there because I'm not seeing fresh ways to wear well-made basics. I mean, freakin' [Primary.com](https://Primary.com),  a children's site,  does a better job on its site of showing how to mix and match its basics for fun and personal style.  J. Crew needs to edit the hell out of its inventory and maybe reconsider what value they can bring to consumers that other elevated-basics lines like Cuyana and Everlane aren't offering.  Perhaps younger consumers are attuned to a digital-first model for remixing/restyling retailer offerings and Instagram and TikTok work for them, but maybe J. Crew needs to consider [a catalog to revive that emotional connection with their older customers](https://www.townandcountrymag.com/style/fashion-trends/a32434902/j-crew-bankrupty-catalog-nostalgia/) or create a new type of communal, social catalog event with younger ones.
text:Upvote from a fellow genxer! Agree with everything you say. In the meantime... a walk down my own memory lane...  I did the preppy thing in high school for a year (1982) but we didn't even have a Jcrew near us! The first time I was introduced to Jcrew was in my early 20s, first career, by my first boss. I will always associate Jcrew with that boss, she was so stylish. We'd go shopping together, she'd give tips on how to style and all about fit etc. We are still friends after all these years and whenever she comes to visit, like a ritual, we'd go hit Jcrew together.   I do think maybe 10 years ago Jcrew's site was much more exciting than it is today. Showed how to style things together. They stopped doing that.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Stop Dressing For Your Height [Tim Dessaint]	labels:I've never understood the fascination with absolute height as something that would qualify or disqualify someone from wearing a particular style or trying something. E.g. "Don't cuff your pants if you're short."  Like long coats aren't any different whether you're 5' or taller than Lebron James. What *is* different are your relative proportions and that *can* affect whether certain things look good on you or not.   Things like arm or leg length vs torso height but that's a ratio and has nothing to do with your absolute height.  Maybe I've spent too much time on the internet where everyone is the same height in pictures but I've *never* seen a good example where someone was too short or too tall for a styling.
text:It's not that people think height will disqualify items, but that short men will want very desperately to be percieved as less short. The resulting tips vary in usefulness -- stripe rules are mostly dumb, contrast rules are very slightly useful (but mostly just when you're standing alone without many clear reference points and far from your observer), but like you said, the proportion stuff is the key.  But cuffing your pants is... I mean, I'm going to do it, but the idea is that, proportionately, since your inseam is already shorter than average, a large cuff might make your legs seem even shorter. And what's the point of a short cuff? That's just boring.  I'm not sure exactly what the proportion argument is with Overcoats. If anything, proportion is less of an issue, because most overcoats sold these days err on the short side, meaning that, if you get them, they'll still fit, they'll just end a little past your knee... which is where they're supposed to end anyway.  Buuut figuring out cuff height ratios and arm to torso ratios and proportions with chest and waist width and all that, and what to do with all of that information... that's a tricky challenge, so it's easier for youtubers to just say, "idk, just wear stripes or whatever man." The best points don't get as much attention as the simplest points.	labels:> And what's the point of a short cuff? That's just boring.  I will *not* stand for these attacks on [smol cuffs](https://i.imgur.com/aLjXg7P.jpg) They're the best for me haha.  I guess I just don't believe that there's any reasonable actions you can take to appear taller or shorter really (as it relates to absolute height). Two people can both be short and have different proportions that make large cuffs or high rises on pants look different.   I've never seen an outfit where I thought someone was too tall or too short for something. I see your point about the implicit link, but I find that advice to often be more harmful than helpful since it kind of plays into the whole "you should be ashamed for being short" nonsense. I'm not particularly short (or tall) though at 5'8" so maybe I'm way off.	episode_done:True

Runner up is a beautiful long wool coat from Everlane that I got for $50 from my alma mater’s free and for sale group- barely worn and in perfect condition, super warm and stylish.   Worst buy: this scratchy sweater I got from the Banana Republic outlet in Palm Springs. It was definitely an impulse buy because I heard how aMAzInG this outlet was supposed to be and felt obligated to buy something. Sweater looked good and felt soft in store, felt like tiny needles once worn at home. I guess I didn’t read the label carefully and only later discovered it was some random fiber. I’m too lazy to rehome it quite yet so it just stares at me in my closet reminding me of my poor spending habits.
text:Ooooh, the Cabazon outlets? Yeah, they're hit or miss; definitely still outlet stores and require diligent hunting if you want to find that good stuff. I've been a couple times and wasn't super impressed with the BR store (this makes me sad). Ann Taylor was also kind of ehh but better luck.   It seems that the higher end and the less common stores often carry "last season" authentic stuff which can be a boon (once I got some stellar basic silk tank tops from Seven for All Mankind that go with everything).  Scratchy sweaters suck :(	labels:> Ooooh, the Cabazon outlets?  Totally agree with you that they're hit or miss (as all outlets are) but *damn* I miss them. I used to go out to that area for work a few times a year pre-Covid and I loved making a quick stop to peruse the outlets. Get an iced coffee and stroll leisurely around the outlets, browse and touch things, see what treasures I could find. Can't wait to do that again.	episode_done:True
text:WEEKLY DEALZ!	labels:My FAVOURITE clothing company of all time, [Verillas](https://www.verillas.com/verillas-boneyard/) is having a giant sale.  Most of it is seconds and prototypes, but some of it is normal goods on vast clearance. I already bought myself a kilt i've been lusting over for years, at half price!    This is also their last boneyard (seconds and prototypes) sale ever, which is very sad making for those of us who eagerly anticipate it every year.  Their style is sort of gothy pagan, not everybody's tastes, but their quality is really quite good. I own about 5 of their pieces and wish i could afford more.
text:Oh wow - What do you buy from them? Some of the women's pieces are very reminiscent of Skunkfunk, a brand I like a lot, but their style also seems to be all over the place and reminds me a lot of what some Ren Faire friends of mine used to wear - I bet it was Verillas!	labels:Well, i just treated myself to the Maurader kilt (please don't judge me on the price, i work damn hard for a living and it was HALF OFF and in the Before Times i went out dancing almost every weekend and almost never buy nice things so i think i've earned it).    I also bought 2 years ago in their pre-Pride sale a rainbow Pride kilt, which i also wore 2-3 times a month, for various events.  I only had the opportunity to wear it to one wedding, but i hope in the future i can wear it to one.  The Eastern Warrior shorts are my favourite shorts of all time, super loose and flowy.  A bit on the delicate side, but fortunately they are totally affordable.  I also have a Kai Bee hooded tank. Wishlist items include some of the assymetrical jackets, and i'd love a Brawler vest and someday maybe a hooded cowl.  As i said, i would own tons more if i could afford it, but i do try to add 1-2 pieces a year.  Eventually i'll be fully outfitted!	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - February 16, 2021	labels:Hi guys,  So I’m going to Chicago in the summer to attend grad school. My question is for those who are familiar with the city, what should I wear based on the season? I know that summer and winter are especially bad in Chicago weather wise and preparing for this would be a good idea I think.
text:What climate are you coming from?  Summer isn't nearly as bad as much of the rest of an the US.  Winter is cold but you will survive.	labels:Well, I've lived in different climates. I have lived in Florida, Houston, Seattle, and the Netherlands. Florida and Houston's weather was pretty similar. They were both very hot and humid year-round. Summers were particularly bad, but winters were pretty mild. Seattle and the Netherlands are pretty similar weather-wise as well, with a lot of dark, cloudy, and rainy weather. The weather in both is pretty mild year-round.   Hopefully, that helps.	episode_done:True

[Fit 1](https://i.imgur.com/HrkkcWg.jpg) - I have a lot of fun wearing this set and I decided to elevate it (literally and figuratively) with platform sandals.

[Fit 3](https://i.imgur.com/WMQaxHj.jpg) - took it from tailored to slouchy.    [Fit 4](https://i.imgur.com/DwQ3Ziy.jpg) - I was inspired by this half skirt/half shorts Margiela piece I was eyeing this sale season.

text:What female TV characters do you think are well-styled and worthy of imitation?	labels:I don’t watch these shows too much, but I really liked Fallon’s style in Dynasty. I’ve been leaning more towards her style lately. I also liked Hannah’s outfits in Pretty Little Liars, and occasionally some of the pieces Aria and Spencer wore. I feel like people hate on Serena from Gossip Girl’s style, but I saved a few screenshots of outfits of hers that I liked. Naomi from 90210 had some cute outfits as well in the later seasons.	episode_done:True

text:How do you balance bright statement pieces with a capsule wardrobe?	labels:Its ok if a strict capsule doesn't work for you. Everyone's capsule can be different. You could have a secondary casule for your bright stuff to mix and match if you want! It's all about what works for you.
text:And that may very well be. My idea for wanting to set up a capsule wardrobe was because in the last 5 years, I've moved 7 times, so I'm trying to keep my clothing as little as possible. With a capsule wardrobe, I can have, say, 20-30 pieces and 50+ outfits with them instead of having 20-30 pieces of non-matching color schemes and having maybe 20 outfits.	labels:One more thing, if you can narrow your colors a little, it helps with cohesiveness. Like 1-2 neutrals and 2-3 colors for everything else. You still get some color, but there are a few limits. I have a rule that all my patterns need to have at least one of my colors in it. The primary color should be one of my neutrals or one of my colors, and then it can have anything else after that! If it is a pattern that prioritizes my neutral, then it also needs one of the actual colors too. In my world, that means, if I get a floral item with black, then it should have some pink. It can't be only blues, reds. and greens.	episode_done:True

text:What are your favorite, trusted clothing lines for buying wear-forever investment classics?	labels:[Tieks](tieks.com) shoes are amazing. I buy them used to save some money. Super comfortable as I walk around all day (teacher). I like the feeling of being barefoot and have high arches. The only trouble I have is that my feet get cold here (Arkansas) in the winter, so I can’t wear mine year round.	episode_done:True
text:Let's talk the impact of fragrance on perception of style! How much does a person's fragrance affect your impression of them? Do you choose perfume with this in mind? What are some of your favourites?	labels:Most of the time I don't think fragrance matters that much, but occasionally someone is wearing something that smells AMAZING and it certainly changes my perception of them.  One of my ex-gfs wore Byredo Mojave Ghost and I swear it made her 10x more attractive to me because it just smelled *so damn good* (don't get me wrong, I already found her attractive.) I ended up wearing it too, and it's the only scent I have that gets constant compliments from people.  So, it doesn't matter unless the scent is a banger. :P	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else have “irony pieces”?	labels:I bought a big orange felt sunhat from Vinnies because I was out on a very sunny day. It’s  almost the same colour as my hair, and seemed ridiculous, but it was $7 or something like that and I was getting sunburnt, so I got it.   I don’t wear bright colours, and my wardrobe is basically maroon, blush pink, grey, and black.   [I think I look great in the stupid hat.](https://imgur.com/a/3QkjKvY) I wear it a lot.

text:Has consulting a stylist really been a revelation to you?	labels:I used Stitch Fix for my husband because he hates shopping and won’t really wear things I buy him. It has been amazing. She picks out things that he’d never have picked himself that he loves. He has a totally new wardrobe and never had to go to the store. I think it is totally worth it and when I’m not pregnant, I’ll probably get some boxes too
text:I didn’t have a great experience with stitch fix. I kept getting reassigned to a new person each month and they never really seemed to make much of an attempt to pick things that suit me or that fit particularly well	labels:StitchFix was great for me for dresses and pants. But my major fit issue is that I have giant boobs, and they COULD NOT pick tops that worked.	episode_done:True

text:How do I feel sexy at home in winter?	labels:matching bra and panties. it works wonders. I do this in the summer too (on summer bra days, which with boob sweat there are not many). when I buy a new bra, I typically get 2-3 coordinating panties in different styles so I have some options, and then put them together under all my clothes. I swear there's a posture change when I'm wearing ratty underclothes vs nice ones. even if no one sees it, I know it's there.
text:Who wears a bra at home? 😅 jk this is good advice!	labels:No you’re asking the right question LOL	episode_done:True
text:Distinct Fashion Phases	labels:I’m also a teen and I’m new to styling and clothes and fashion and all.  When I was little (basically from when I was 5 to like around 9) I was what some people called a stereotypical girly girl. I only wanted to wear skirts. Hated pants. I *loved* pink. I loved to wear cool and frilly skirts and also skirts with graphic prints (and by that I mean Hello Kitty I was obsessed lmao) and also I loved dresses.   Then when I was around 10/11 I started straying away from dresses and more towards jeans and sweatshirts and graphic tees and Hot Topic t-shirts. And basically just continued just that casual style with jeans and a t-shirt lol.   Now I’m starting to get into fashion and finding out what I like. I’m also getting into more vintage looking things thanks to vintage and sewing youtubers such as Karolina Zebrowska, Bernadette Banner, Rachel Maksy, and etc. Now I still have a lot of the Hot Topic shirts and jeans and all but I’m getting into styling them. And also I’ve gotten rid of a lot of my wardrobe that I just didn’t want/like/fit me anymore.  I have/had a lot of clothes that I like but I don’t feel especially passionate about. Very few pieces make me feel especially passionate or I love thoroughly. But  now I’m getting a few pieces that I know I’m going to *love* and are going to develop the style I want (which is probably a casually edgy victorian 50s Newsie with a modern twist lmao. Idk lol) And I’m also starting to get into sewing some clothes I like (haven’t started but I bought the supplies for sewing two skirts. ).   Also now I have a badass jean jackets and more beanies. I love beanies. Lol      Don’t really have much to say about my makeup journey because I don’t wear any. Other than when I was little I use to wear it for dance recitals and was into makeup. Then I just wasn’t anymore. Now I’m getting into skincare (because of my mom) and I’m considering getting some makeup and starting off with it. But I’m kinda clueless lmao.

text:I love HauteLeMode. No need to buy to be a fashion enthusiast. I follow a lot of fashion designers on Instagram and I like seeing his takes on the latest collections.	labels:I love his takes too! Even when he rips something to shreds, he isn't really mean about it. He also offers suggestions to how he thinks it can look better. I also love how he compares design houses and how the creative director influences the brand. I've learned a lot and laughed a lot while watching him.	episode_done:True

My uniform in like 2004/5 was low rise hollister skinny jeans, PUFFY ETNIES skater sneakers (+1 if they were the black sneakers with hot pink laces with stars) or crazy colored converse and a white studded belt, some terrible local bands t shirt and side bangs. Not just regular side bangs but side bangs that hid one eye completely   Then later we all discovered hairspray so we all got super choppy long mullets and teased the shit out of them. And still had side bangs but even swoopier and more comb-overy   Makeup was full bottom(!) waterline black eyeliner and the NUDE Mac lipstick that looked like foundation  * edit: I do remember my first pair of high waisted black skinny jeans in maybe 2007/8 and boy howdy did those BDGs change my life. Also this memory makes me feel very old because I can distinctly pinpoint the periods in my life when I aged into and then aged out of urban outfitters. D:  * edit edit : wow wow ok so I do remember in the very early 2000s (maybe 2001?) a friend of mine being extremely excited to wear a sleeveless collared tank with a tie(??) to the first day of middle school a la Avril Lavigne and that was THE COOLEST

text:[Serious answers only] FAQ: Why does runway fashion looks like nothing you'd ordinarily wear on the daily?	labels:Completely unqualified to answer this but as an outsider to the industry looking in I always assumed that runway fashion was just an art form and fashion shows are essentially like a gallery exhibition.   I always bite my tongue when crazy over the top runway stuff is posted because I assume people are respecting the artistic view and not the practicality of use/wear. Obviously it’s good for people to be exposed to art outside of their wheelhouse so it’s encouraged that runway stuff be allowed in this sub but I’m glad this was posted as I feel this needs addressed and defined for the guys like me not interested in designers and we just want to look good for the people around us.   If we are going to host the entire spectrum of fashion on this sub we need some kind of classification system for noobs like me and clear definitions of what’s really going on with that type of fashion. It’s taken me years to be able to deal with figuring out the nuances and we could save so many guys like me a lot of time (and downvotes) by delving into this line of questioning.
text:>Completely unqualified to answer this but as an outsider to the industry looking in I always assumed that runway fashion was just an art form and fashion shows are essentially like a gallery exhibition.   Kind of, but let's not lose sight of the fact that the point is to sell clothes. Even the  very abstract, inaccessible, and just not for sale looks have an economic point in that they drum up hype for the brand. The idea is that people will see those looks, decide they want to be a part of that aesthetic world, and go buy the more accessible ready to wear looks from the brand.	labels:Agreed with this but will also add that there's a separate dimension to this: art collection.	episode_done:True

text:Difficulty distinguishing between so 'idealized' style and personal style?	labels:Right now, a lot of people's best intentions are devolving into "old lounge wear" because we haven't anywhere to go.

Australia just got out of lockdown, I know Germany is going back in partially, the UK's going back in... and America is still a chaotic mess, but a lot of people are still working from home. So part of the answer may be "wait unti the world is different for you".
text:Yeah, if we don’t go out we slump and slouch watching tv eating food. That’s a great way to ruin some special pieces. If i’m out then i’m fine with standing straight and not being reclined. I need to plan some events so I can wear those pieces.	labels:	episode_done:True

Blazers, too: anything with strong shoulders, a nipped waist and a slightly longer length.   Silk scarves and vintage clip on earrings—I have a bit of an obsession with both. The combination can dress up a lazy outfit in seconds, in a way that's appropriate for any occasion.  Flowy midi skirts and dresses, especially pleated or wrap-around designs. Much more comfortable than jeans, and eye-catching, too.  Blouses: button-front silk shirts, cotton Liberty prints, and anything white/cream with lace or ruffles.  And because we're still in a pandemic...silk satin face masks. I've actually enjoyed matching them to my outfits!

text:Decolonize Sustainable and Ethical Fashion	labels:This is great, but this sub constantly shares links for Amazon and fast fashion brands so there is a long way to go. It would also help to share resources on what to look for instead of what to avoid. If those buzzwords aren't real guarantees, how do you know? How do you check if what you're about to purchase is truly eco/human friendly at all?
text:>This is great, but this sub constantly shares links for Amazon and fast fashion brands so there is a long way to go.  Keep in mind that sustainable/ethical fashion is pretty pricey and people don't always have the option to buy ethically. Thrift shopping definitely helps, but depending on your situation it can be difficult to rely on thrift stores entirely. But maybe as things get more automated, sustainable/ethical fashion can become more affordable. Of course, a cultural shift regarding our wardrobes would help to, but that's not exactly easy to pull off. SOMETHING needs to be done, we can't keep consuming the way that we do...	labels:I think everyone should have access to affordable clothing and my way to combine this with sustainability is simply to buy less. Even if it’s fast fashion, amazon, etc I often see amazon reviews where the person bought one in each color. For me, the way to do better is simply to buy less.	episode_done:True

text:Supreme Spring/Summer 2021	labels:I’m just here for the comments  Edit: I guess since I’m one of the few people here into streetwear without adjectives I should probably say something.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- October 19	labels:Hi there. I’m about 5 feet 10.5 inches tall and I usually weigh around 165-170 pounds. Usually I wear a size 33 slim fit jean from old navy or something and they fit perfect.  Lately, I’ve gained a little weight and I’m at around 190 pounds. Most of my fat is on my stomach area which forces me to have a larger waist size to be more comfortable. I would say waist size 35 is the most comfortable right now, however, when I purchase a size 35 waist slim Jean, they tend to be a little bit baggy. I’ve tried skinny jeans and they are too tight.   My question is, what is the best way to have a comfortable around the waist Jean but also not be baggy in slim style. Right now I’m just spamming joggers because they are comfortable and slim. What would you all recommend in this situation?
text:so i'm 5'11" 185 with slim legs so i feel your pain. few options:  1. Just embrace the slim/straight look and accept that jeans will be a little bit looser around your legs than you would like 2. Find a stretch jean that works for you, this will give you more give in the waist and allow your jeans to still stay slim. I like Outerknown SEA jeans. 3. Pricey option but I've found Norse Project jeans are quit slim in the calves and thighs relative to waist size 4. Find a pair of jeans you like in the waist and have a tailor taper the legs. I haven't personally done this because I'm ok with the options above.	labels:Thank you for your input! Question on the Outer Known jeans.. do you have any more info on that?

text:Learning about technical side of clothes - fabrics, care, quality etc.	labels:I think to some extent this is a class issue - if you’ve never had family that can afford nice fabrics/well-made clothes, how would you ever learn about them without doing extensive independent research? My mom was raised by very wealthy grandparents until she was ten, and then went to live with her very poor single mother until she left for college. Her grandma had just married into money, though, and grew up in abject poverty, so she had to sew all her own clothes before she met my great-grandpa. The effect of this upbringing was that my mom learned how to sew and tailor and to value good construction/quality fabric, but couldn’t actually afford it on her own - so she became a world-class thrift flipper in college, and bought high-quality men’s clothes for cheap and tailored them to fit. It also meant that, since she was poor for quite a while but had been taught to care for expensive things, she was very particular about washing everything cold and only hang-drying so that her clothes would last forever. I have inherited clothes that were my great-grandmother’s that are still in beautiful condition because my mom took really good care of them. The reason I know about clothing/shoe/jewelry quality and construction is because my mom taught me and made sure I learned how to identify good seams, good fabric, and knew how to take care of things so they’d last.
text:I disagree heavily with the notion about class. I think you are basing your theory purely off of anecdotal evidence. There are plenty of people who grow up with money and don’t care about the clothes or the quality of the fabrics, rather they think „I paid a lot for this, so it must be good quality“. I think poor people sewing their own clothes because it’s cheaper is also an antiquated belief. As someone who recently got into garment sewing, I could literally save hundreds of dollars if I just shopped fast fashion sales every week.  In the era of fast fashion, if you don’t WANT to know about quality garments, fabrics, and what to look for to recognize skill, then you don’t have to.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - December 13, 2020	labels:I hope nobody takes this comment as me being an asshole, because I’m intending this to be more of a constructive criticism than that.  But honestly, as someone whose style kind of stagnated somewhere in the mid 2010s, I kind of feel like this sub isn’t very helpful for updating my style, because the sub also refuses to catch up with what’s fashionable.  Like streetwear has obviously captured the zeitgeist for quite a while now. That’s always been an element of my wardrobe. But I feel like I could do better to expand my style and have more options and just in general better embrace trends and incorporate them into my own personal style.  But for the most part this sub isn’t really interested in keeping up. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not expecting this sub to start going crazy for box logos or Supreme or dress like a futuristic cartoon character, if I was interested in that I would actually just read r/streetwear. But I do wish some of the recurring threads and users could offer some inspo in terms of tasteful, grown up streetwear outfits and things like that. But from my perception, MFA is still stuck in early 2010s menswear, J. Crew inspired Americana, or just outright standard business casual. Which is *fine*, it doesn’t look bad, but it’s certainly not fashionable anymore and despite that the default male fashion sub won’t look beyond it, largely.  EDIT: People have been asking me for examples, here’s some stuff that I’ve liked lately, I don’t know that most or any of this is what you’d call “streetwear” but it’s more in the direction of what I’m talking about   Thom Yorke is one of my consistently favorite style inspo sources, he pulls off a pretty good hybrid of tasteful streetwear and classic menswear style I think.  I like this kind of fit he’s worn a lot of the last couple years:   (Actually can’t find the exact pic I’m looking for here so I’ll try my best here)  https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/theoaklandpress.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/1/4b/14bc5350-f6ff-11e8-8bd7-83eb124e2f8a/5c052f56b8ad2.image.jpg?resize=1200%2C800  Usually coupled with one of these Undercover jackets like this:  https://static.stereogum.com/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1161546807-1570042584-compressed.jpg  I think one of the pieces he wears a lot are the Acne Ryder pants, which I kind of like as hybrid classic menswear combined with a more informal, streetwear adjacent vibe:  https://www.nordstrom.com/s/acne-studios-ryder-slim-fit-pants/5146319  I also like Acne in general and I wish I could afford some of these jeans to work into some outfits I have kicking around in my head:  https://www.acnestudios.com/us/en/max-blue-black/B00146-AIL.html?categid=man-jeans  I also like Daniel Lopatin aka Oneohtrix Point Never’s style as well, who I’d say does kind of a more tasteful streetwear thing as well. This press pic is a nice example:  https://dazedimg-dazedgroup.netdna-ssl.com/1400/azure/dazed-prod/1230/9/1239834.jpg  More OPN with bonus Safdie brother: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DOn1aXWWsAAeZSC.jpg  I also like these black denim jackets, chore jackets kind of thing. I have a good Rag & Bone one that I’ve gained too much weight to wear, but these 3sixteen and Rogue Territory ones are nice too and along those lines:  https://www.3sixteen.com/collections/outerwear/products/type-3s-denim-jacket-lightweight-double-black   https://www.rogueterritory.com/collections/jackets/products/supply-jacket-stealth-black?variant=5415637057568  Also along these lines, this Carhartt WIP jacket: https://stagprovisions.com/collections/carhartt-wip/products/carhartt-wip-modular-jacket-ss18  In general I like the use of black/muted or monochromatic colors, I like the idea of drawing influence from punk/hardcore style because I’m into that as well, but I haven’t figured out exactly how to make that work. Also for that reason, I’d like to replace my Red Wings with a pair of Docs, I like the rougher around the edges style better.

text:What types of dresses would it be practical to have on hand for common different wedding types?	labels:This is literally the first time I've ever don't wear black to a wedding.  Growing up in a suburb of NYC, that's what everyone wears all the time.   I'd get your "little black dress" because that is a good purchase and if you pick the cut smartly (and it doesn't look too trendy) you'll be able to wear it for years. At this point I have maybe 3 of them in different lengths/modesty levels and a few black and white numbers that always work and are great for transitional times like fall and early spring. In the winter use that same dress but wear tights and winter accessories (I like pearls, close toed shoes, and (faux) fur but you do you). I can't sing the praises of an awesome black dress because you will use it for a ton of non-wedding events too.  If black is a no go I'd do a dark color that you love, but I'd probably stay away from big prints because that can date a piece.   I'd also get at least 1 summer dress that floats off your body when you have events in July and August. Mine is around knee length but maxis and tea length are good too (personally i find maxi's too hot on the 100 degree plus days).	episode_done:True

Coats in a closet and on a tree, clothes in closets and dressers, seasonal items under the bed, etc. I just tried to really slim down my collection, but each piece I found that I hadn’t worn in a while, it wasn’t because it didn’t look good, it had just moved to the back/bottom or was forgotten. My biggest problem is that I usually buy stuff half off goodwill stuff, wear for 6 months, then donate to the local human society thrift store (or directly to the thrift store if I don’t like it). I’m constantly shopping and discarding, but also justify keeping items because “it’s the wrong season, I’ll wear it in 4 months” or “it for specials occasions”.	episode_done:True

text:Boat shoes are just one particular style of handsewn shoes. They're only hated so much because they took off like a pop song that got played too much on the radio. Handsewns that are basically any form of loafer, camp mocs, blucher mocs, etc. are all a fantastic and comfortable choice for casual wear and I'm honestly shocked more people don't wear them and instead opt for boots year-round or other hefty GYW shoes.

It might sound childish but that’s the point I want to meet my child in his childhood, I want him to have a fun parent.   Does this seem odd?
text:This seems awesome.  I think of clothing as a daily luxury and since most of our living is done day to day, it's absolutely worth having fun within our budgets.

text:Colour/Style Matching - How do I figure out the potential of my wardrobe?	labels:The first step is knowing what you have - colors, shapes/silhouettes, patterns, etc. and what makes you feel comfortable. The best outfit means nothing if you're uncomfortable/self conscious in it.  A few tricks that have worked for me until I got more comfortable with my closet and could slowly evolve it and venture out:  \- Black or other neutrals are your friend. Pair with a pop of color or a fun pattern. This made breaking things down for me much easier.  \- Find complementary accessories. Statement bracelet, necklace, earrings, scarf, blazer. Whatever you like. Even adding this one element can tie things together.  \- Try different combos of what you have together. Figure out what you feel comfortable in and what shapes work together and what colors you actually like together. One concept that works for me is if I wear more fitted on the bottom, I put something a little looser on top or vice versa.  One thing that really helped me when I had to elevate my wardrobe game for work stuff was a trick I heard they teach associates at a fancy pants store. I don't know if this is actually true but I still found the concept helpful: every outfit should have 3-4 pieces. Skinny Jeans/camisole/cardigan/statement earrings- wham! Leggings/sweater/scarf. This has helped me when I'm staring at my closet with a sweater and jeans wondering if I can do something else to snazz it up.  If you're interested in working with color, I would suggest just browsing about color theory to see if there are some ideas there that may inspire you on things that may work together. Also figuring out what colors work with *your* skintone/hair/eyes is very helpful in narrowing things down.  **That was a long way of saying, try things out and observe the types of styles/outfits you like, what works for your own lifestyle/needs, and just have fun with it!**	episode_done:True

text:Favorite fashion bloggers that are your size?	labels:I'm nearly exactly the same. (I’m 5’5”, 140 lbs). Though sizing can be as extreme as 4-10.   Short torso, thick waist, slim hips, very large calves. Most brands are really bad with having shoulders and arms wide enough, and building pecs have pulled the tits up a bit, making the many cleavages end bellow my bra band.  So I look for clothes with extra room in arms, shoulders and volume in the hips. Flare is a must, as slim hips with a tiny potbelly looks horrible in straight models. Some luck with Noa Noa, but quality is inconsistent.  High waist pants work, if they're loose. High waist jeans press on my whole lower torso and gives me stomach ache. So Levi's are out until this trend breaks. Baum und Pferdgarten had great ones.  Skinny fit with the right hip size often doesn't go over my calves.   Brand wise, Nordic (Noa Noa, Baum und Pferdgarten, Samsoe Samsoe) usually works better then Spanish (Zara, Mango, Desigual NEVER fits right).  One of my favorite tricks is picking oversized models, and going down a size. My favorite coat, with the waist at the right place, is a xs Brixtol. Otherwise it's impossible to find something with the right shoulder-waist measurements.   I live in Sweden so brand overlap is often bad.
text:It is crazy how much individual body components can change fit! I have fairly lean legs with small calves, but a giant butt, large hips, and a bit of a pot belly as well. Until recently I had small shoulders and arms, but I started 3 new hobbies that all build shoulder and arm muscle, and have ripped the yokes of two button-downs and one blazer that used to fit me in the past few months, like some kind of Hulk.

text:What rules do you break for your body type?	labels:I'm on the edge between straight and plus sizes myself, and pretty much everything I wear is boxy/oversized/drapey. It's comfortable, what can I say? I know a lot of the stuff I wear would look a lot more flattering on someone thinner than me, but IDGAF. Sure, an XL would fit me better, but if I buy it in a 2X it's so much comfier! I suppose my visual saving grace is that I pretty much wear exclusively black.  I recently got a sewing machine and I've been having a blast sewing myself drapey skirts and dresses that fit my esthetic (forest witch would be a good name for it.) Because I don't actually want anything to be fitted I don't bother with patterns or anything. I pretty much just play around with fabric in a way that what I make functionally works as clothes.

text:What’s some of the best general advice you’d give to someone new to female fashion?	labels:Like others have mentioned, learning your body type and playing to that is a big one.  Think about your strengths, what you love about your body and what your most flattering outfits are really emphasizing.  Cuts, shapes, lines, colors, all of that.  Try a lot on and make observations.  Another thing is getting the whole finished look.  Everything that goes into a complete look: outfit, shoes and accessories, bag, makeup and nails, and haircut and hair style.  There's things that are going to make you look insatiable and things that won't be quite right, and things that really don't have much of an effect either way.  Not everything needs to be the absolute best (that honestly sounds exhausting!) but try to avoid the things that work against you.   One or 2 statement pieces.  You don't want your outfit competing with itself.   Develop your personal style.  You said you like goth but I bet there's even more to that.  Within that range or outside of it, *what do you like*.   Find that merger in what style you like, what works for you, and your own personal style.  Experiment objectively.	episode_done:True
text:Revisiting Tim Gunn's List of 10 Style Must-haves	labels:This is what my modernized/personalized list would look like:   - versatile dressy dress - I had a black and gray sheath dress from Banana Republic that was perfect for multiple types of events (but a bit boring). Accidentally shrunk it and was on the hunt for something new, but doesn't matter during pandemic times.   - light jacket - I cycled through a faux leather jacket and a trench coat for a few years each. Currently using a black utility jacket, but I think the leather jacket was my favorite in this category.   - wool ankle pants - feels more modern than classic dress pants, and can be dressed up or down. I have a relaxed straight fit pair in blue that I regularly wear with either sneakers or flats. On the hunt for a lighter color and fabric to wear during warmer months.   - flannel shirt - I have an oversized olive green one. Can double as 3rd piece.   - sweater - can be easy to dress up/down depending on color and fabric. I have a few, but a faded green cotton sweater was my favorite last fall.  - versatile skirt - needs replacing. I currently have a knee length cotton skirt with a white pattern. Given how often I wear it, I likely need to buy two to replace it.   - blouse - I have many, but a gray silky blouse with embroidery probably got the most wear this year.   - well fitting jeans - check   - blazer or 3rd piece - I have been using the same jersey blazer for the past 4-5 years. The jersey makes the blazer easy to wear casually, and it has a striped inner lining that looks nice when the sleeves are rolled up. But I really want something different/fun, just now sure what yet.   - loungewear - joggers joggers joggers   This was a cool exercise. It was helpful to think in terms of categories. While I didn't have or need some of the exact pieces from the original list (ex cashmere sweater), I could see that I had some version of it.  Edit for formatting.	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - January 15, 2021	labels:I'm very stressed.   My apartment lease is up in mid April, and I do not want to renew. There has been a string of car and apartment break ins over the past few months (my car being the first one to kick start it), and the complex refuses to install security camera or fix the doors.  Additionally unless I sign up for a 16 month lease (two more months than the one I have right now), my rent would get kicked up $200 a month.   I decided to buy a house. I make a decent amount and have a good amount money to put down. I did not realize that it takes about a month to get everything ready for a loan, and in turn, to make an offer on a house. The houses in the area I'm looking in are going fast, and at this rate, it is looking like I'd have to build a home (which I am ok with), however a new house would be ready by at least fall of this year. I do not want to do this, because if I do, I would have get a temp lease for that time, and any place (around me) I get a temp lease at, I would be losing money since the rate is so high. It would be wiser for me to move another place, save up more money for a year, and kick off the home buying process a bit sooner.  So right now my plan is, wait until I get preapproved for a loan (which should be around the end of January/start of Feb), look for a house until the last day of February, then if I haven't found a house I like, I start looking for a cheeper safer apartment, if I found a house I like, I make an offer. It's a short time frame to make such a huge important decision. I have already put a lot of time and effort into this already, so for me I have to see this through to the end, but I am afraid that this is all for nothing.

Someone should get on that.  You've got plenty of options if you're okay with wool blends, lots of brands offer knitwear with varying degrees of natural fibres. Have you tried alternative fibers like Alpaca?  RRL consistently releases some really interesting Shawl Collar sweaters in varying fibre mixes. I've never seen one though that mimics the chunkiness around the collar that wool offers.  I know a bunch of these are sold out, but maybe they'll help you find something that is available.  https://www.ralphlauren.com/men-clothing-sweaters/cotton-blend-shawl-cardigan/516563.html  https://stagprovisions.com/products/rrl-cotton-blend-shawl-cardigan-ss20  https://www.matchesfashion.com/us/products/1264009  https://www.schottnyc.com/products/mutlicolor-cotton-cardigan.htm?color=14&catID=6  https://www.schottnyc.com/products/motif-cardigan.htm?color=105&catID=6  https://www.schottnyc.com/products/yak-blend-sweater-jacket.htm?color=105&catID=6	labels:	episode_done:True

text:How much was your most expensive fashion item and when or how often do you wear it?	labels:I bought some [Rick Owens wedge ankle boots](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/90/43/2c/90432cc70e4be6e309614e1c517b8454.jpg) circa 2013 for about $450 on ebay. They're my best height::comfort heels and I still wear them all the time. I've resoled them maybe 2-3 times. The leather is wearing down in places but I use cream polish to keep it going (aaaaand googling for this comment is how I learned Meltonian shoe polish was discontinued. Fuck!). I'd guess they still have a few more years of life.  I do have a few other items in a similar price range that don't end up getting use, so I resell them and usually don't lose too much, if any, money on them. Usually if I buy something and don't use it, it's because it's not just too luxurious to risk using - it's also just a type of garment I don't actually wear in my daily life. I make this mistake with cheaper clothes too. My best $$$ buys are when they're replacing a cheaper item I already wear all the time.

text:Winter jackets that are good for skiing and casual use?	labels:No specific recommendations but some general advice. Buy something black and not one of the “hot” colors or those that you can pick up on sale. Decide what sort skiing you actually do. If you are resort skiing a hard shelled jacket works well, if backcountry you might look at soft shells. Powder skirts are common on jackets marketed for skiing are really not necessary and are a pain for day to day use. A good heavier goretex jacket from a name brand would give you a broad range as you can layer while skiing and still make it work in the city. A good Arcteryx or Patagonia shell jacket will last you many years and you can use it in a broad range of temperatures and settings. Live and ski in a mountain town with many days much below freezing and never felt the need for an insulated ski jacket as they end up being too warm or not warm enough most of the time. Having option to throw a fleece and long sleeve wool top under one in the spring or light weight puffy during deep winter for skiing and being able to wear over “regular” clothing in the city makes a good shell jacket the best choice.
text:Black is generally a poor color. So is white, brown, green, or any color that will blend into the snow during an emergency. You want to be a  visible neon glow stick. Also to help avoid collisions at a resort.	labels:Agreed, my current snow jacket is black because I also wore it as a general-purpose rain/cold jacket in the city. But it's suboptimal for skiing because it blends in too much in poor visibility conditions. It's a safety concern, and it also makes you very hard to pick out in a crowd if you're with friends. My next snow jacket will be a bright color.	episode_done:True

text:What will be obsolete by summer 2021?	labels:I think we are seeing the removal of skinny jeans.  Not they won't exist anymore, but that they are going to be very dated looking.  I think of this like the boot cut that skinny replaced, you could still get them, people wore them, but the dominate fashion pant was the skinny jean.   When I look around on line I see a fuller leg with a shorter hem (crop, the pant I hate, if I am that hot, its not that 2" above my ankle that needs extra air, and in winter I don't want that exposure, or always being in a taller boot, and or matching my socks, oh how I have the crop, back to the subject).  I also see higher waist pants becoming much more dominant, possibly making not only low waist but also natural waist pants looking dated.  Again, I will say, just as you could always find bootcut, you will still be able to find a full length skinny pant.    In shirts, the crop/waist I can see continuing especially if the higher waist pant becomes more fashionable.  I can also see more fitted shirts that you tuck in, especially body suit types, as they go with the higher waist, looser leg.  Longer tunic type tops may move out of fashion agin because they work best with a skinny pant.  As I am typing I just got it, I see a "flip" on the silhouette, from full top to a fitted bottom to a fitted top to a fuller bottom.
text:I’m fully on board with the death of skinny jeans. I haven’t owned a pair in a couple of years, and recently when I’ve tried them on I can’t wait to peel them off my legs.	labels:I remember when they first became popular over 10 years ago and I was already insecure about how skinny my legs were (just my calves and ankles... my thighs and hips are NOT small) and the trend still hasn't died but I forgot how against them I was.	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- October 25	labels:I got a question about shirt sizing... So I'm a short guy (5ft 6in) and long sleeved shirts are usually a problem for me because I have a large chest/shoulders for my height. I just got a Taylor stitch shirt in XS as that's what they're size guide recommended me. However, as is the case with most shirts I try, it's a bit tight in the back (I have a 38in chest). This only applies if I'm crossing my arms, giving a hug, or tying my shoes or something (basically moving both arms forward). The shirt fits everywhere else and is otherwise fine. I know that it I size up though, the shirt length will be a little too long and the sleeve length will be too long, despite fitting more relaxed in the chest/back area.  Do I size up or retain my current size? Again, the only real problem area is that the shirt hugs my chest a little bit and I feel the fabric strain across my back if I try to cross my arms (not enough so that it feels like it will rip, but it still strains).	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - November 26, 2020	labels:I've seen warnings about Gustin before but just wanted to relay my most recent experience as my own warning.   I ordered about five pieces a couple months ago and they're just starting to arrive. One of which was a pair of sweatpants. I followed their sizing guidelines (I'm 29 waist) and they recommended an XS. Already, red flags are apparent as I never wear an XS but I figure they know how their clothes fit, I'll go with it.   The sweatpants arrive and I try them on.  They are skintight and short. Not at all how I expected. The quality is there, just the sizing is way off the mark. So I email them asking if they can get me a pair that fit.   This is where things get real lame, real quick. Their customer service says they can exchange them. But *I* have to buy them from their store. They had two sizes left, S and XL. Kind of weird to direct someone to do so when inventory is so limited. Next, I have to go to the post office, pay for a shipping envelope and postage to return the original pair.   I really wanted to give them a chance so i ended up exchanging for a small to see if it’s a better fit but it’s been rubbing me the wrong way for a few days now. For this one pair of sweatpants I will have paid nearly an extra *$30 in shipping* while doing most of the work to process the exchange. I’m still due about 3 other pieces from them and am wondering if I’m going to go through the same ordeal if the fit guides are wonky for pants and shirts, too.   TL;DR Gustin is a hard company to take a gamble on but even if some of the clothes work out, based on my overall experience so far I can’t recommend them for the basics they provide considering the quality can be had for slightly more elsewhere but with a substantially better customer service experience.

I bought it in M, as the site and my measurements recommended, and it seems to fit, but I'm unsure about the **shoulders** and the **sleeve length** specifically. Also, it extends slightly below the knee - is it too long, or just right that way?  I'd love to know if I should tailor the sleeves (and possibly the shoulders?), or if I'm good, or if I should consider ordering the same Coat in size S (currently size M in the pics). I'm around 5'6 ft.

text:Has anyone just said screw it and focused more on fit than color scheme for your outfits? What's an unlikely color combination that you ended up loving?	labels:I'm color blind, but I wasn't born this way (developed due to health issues) and at the beginning I was TERRIFIED of messing up color schemes in an outfit. I only wore black and grey or obsessively used an app for color matching because I was so scared of looking like a fool. That was about 5 years ago. I don't use the app anymore, I put things together based on how they look to me. Shapes and textures really, I said screw trying to color match because it's just never going to work for me haha. People have complimented me on putting unique color combinations together, and it's so funny because I have no idea how it looks to them.

text:What do YOU do with "chub rub" jeans?	labels:So, I'm a personal stylist that specializes in fitting women's denim. In my experience, the useable lifespan of a pair of jeans is about 2 years. Some will hold up longer than that (usually the higher the cotton amount, the longer they will last), but when you're talking middle-of-the-road quality with blended fabric, the two year mark is where you'll start to see warping, color fade, stress on the hardware, but most tragically, crotch breakdown. And this is across the board for women of all shapes and sizes. It's just that the area is subject to constant friction but a lot of my clients worry that it's due to their shape. It's not.  As I mentioned above, probably the best defense is shopping for denim that has a higher cotton percentage, like 98% or more. I have two pairs of 100% cotton vintage Levi's that are 35 and 25 years old respectively with no crotch wear. The caveat is the more cotton content, the less your jeans will stretch. They will mold to your body... but they will not stretch. And you're limited in styles. There aren't really any 100% cotton skinny jeans, at least none that work well for most people so you're kind of limited to that mom/boyfriend/straight style fit.  The second thing you can do is be gentle in caring for your jeans. There are some diehards who never wash their denim. This is a little silly when you're talking non-raw or non-selvedge denim. Please wash your jeans. But I recommend getting a gentle detergent (woolite), do not use fabric softener (actually you shouldn't use it period), wash on cold, gentle cycle inside out, and hang to dry. This is especially important if you are dealing with blended fabric since the stretch fibers will break down when exposed to heat. I recommend washing every 5 or so wears. If you need to freshen up between washes you can toss them in the dryer on low with a handful of ice cubes and a dryer sheet for 15 minutes or until the ice stops rattling. This shouldn't be too damaging since you're not drying saturated fabric for 45+ minutes but it will reset the shape (especially for stretch jeans that are starting to warp and/or sag) and knock out any smell.  For repair, the sooner you address a hole the better. You may be able to self-patch up a hole that's smaller than two fingers through it. If you're crafty, get out the sewing machine and sew what you can. A quick YouTube search will turn up tutorials that are better than anything I could attempt to describe here. You could also patch from the inside and sew everything closed with a little reinforcement. But if the surrounding fabric is starting to degrade or if the hole is big and/or in a conspicuous spot, you really only have one option other than retiring those jeans.  In terms of repair beyond two fingers, the best way to do it for a pair of jeans that you CANNOT bear to part with is to send them to be rewoven. I only know of [one company that does this well](https://www.denimrepair.com/) but it's not exactly cheap ($45 + shipping) so I would really evaluate any denim that you get re-woven. In 20 years I've only had 2 pairs re-woven. It also only really buys you a few more months with stretch denim, maybe a year or two with a higher cotton count. With blended denim, it may just be best to total them. Give them a viking funeral.  All in all, I think your best bet is to just sort of accept that most of your jeans will only last about 2 years. Oh, and when they stop fitting correctly, don't be so hard on yourselves. A lot of the time, jeans will stop fitting because their fabric is warping from being worn and washed. A good way to find jeans that fit is to look based on your height (which will tell you inseam and rise, first and foremost). Most women don't know what their height translates to in terms of those measurements though even though this is one of the biggest reason jeans "don't fit." [This has helped me sort out jeans that will fit in the length and rise for a client.](https://project-fit-mvp.herokuapp.com/) Then I just need to find something they'll like and select their size. It's not pretty but it does like 90% of my styling job by only showing stuff that's going to fit.
text:Wow, I guess I got lucky with mine. I have a pair form [Acne](https://www.acnestudios.com/uk/en/climb-stay-black/A00203-900.html) that is 93% cotton, 5% polyester and 2% elastane, I've had them for 4-5 years and they are my only black jeans so they get worn a ton around the year. I've only just started noticing some slight colour fading on the edges but other than that they are like brand new.  That said I do only wash them when necessary in 30 degrees, no fabric softener, always air dried.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Jeans: Recommendations and Reviews	labels:After trying several premium brands, I have settled on AGOLDE as my favorite ($168). It is about $50-70 cheaper than Citizens of Humanity, AG Jeans, ParkerSmith, Mother (all ~$200-220) and their 98% cotton is both comfortably stretchy and thick enough to feel substantial. The AGOLDE Nico is also the only high waisted jean with high cotton content (98%) that I can wear without feeling like I have an external bowl obstruction whenever I sit down. I like it so much I own three pairs.  I also really like Mother and ParkerSmith. Mother's sizing is all over the place and as a result, are harder to shop for online (and more expensive than AGOLDE). ParkerSmith has more full length jeans than any other brand (I am so fucking tired of everything cropped) but definitely are more focused on basics and have less interesting colors, trendy silhouettes, hems, etc. Both these brands have nice material - substantial, high cotton content and yet forgiving.   For stretchy jeans, Frame or Yoga Jeans are super comfortable but honestly feel much more thin. They are not quite as "jegging" as other stretchy denim, but noticeably thin.   My least favorites are Lucky Brand and Rollas (~$100). Lucky Brand works amazing for my husband, but I've never tried a pair of their women's jeans that fit me well or made me feel like they were worth paying more for than standard Levis. Rollas are high quality denim, but they really go full on on the vintage denim thing and as a result, are just so stiff on me with boyishly unflattering cuts. I refuse to torture myself breaking in anything anymore. Mostly because I have in the past already tortured myself for several weeks on a pair of Rollas that did not in fact, "break in" as much as I needed it to to be comfortable.
text:For all recommending AGOLDE, how do you work out the sizing?  I’ve seen multiple reviews saying that you have to size down like 1-2 sizes or more. Still not sure what more AGOLDE offers for the price point, compared to Weekday or Levi’s (besides sustainability which is definitely a thing worth considering), but I’ve been interested in trying them for awhile.	labels:It really depends on the wash in my experience. I’ve tried the Riley in a few washes and some have been WAY too small in my normal size and in others, I had to go down 1-2 sizes.	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - February 14, 2021	labels:i've accepted the fact that i was irresponsibly spending too much time and money on clothing this past year (heavily fueled by pandemic boredom and free time), and was heading towards an [unhealthy jawnz dopamine spiral](https://www.gq.com/story/buzz-bissinger-shopaholic-gucci-addiction). so i did a rough tally on how much i spent, and the total came out to ~$10000 across ~50 items, which is about one new $200 item per week.  i'm incredibly lucky to be in a position where finances aren't an issue, but being in a constant state of searching for the next purchase hit is making me feel guilty and awful, to be frank. more so the sheer number of things i'm accumulating is becoming overwhelming, and i'm physically running out of space to store these things.  so, i'm going to be much more conscious on my habits and spending this year to curb this addiction, before it gets too late. if there's anyone else in a similar position, i sympathize and hope you can take control as well. thanks for reading.
text:I'm glad you came to the realization! It's honestly tough when you're being exposed to so many cool pieces and stuff on a regular basis. If you do feel the need to take a backseat to get it back under control, that's absolutely the right thing to do. I definitely did that for a good 6 month period recently.  We (regs) all see fashion as a hobby, but ultimately there's a good amount of capitalism and consumerism that does keep the fashion engine turning. It's good to be aware of that from time to time and periodically reassess how in control we are of our spending and idle thinking  Edit: if you don't want to completely disengage with clothing, focus on new and unexpected ways of combining items in your current wardrobe! I've been starting to do that a lot with the City Boy inspo since it uses a lot of my current items but in a much different styling	labels:every season it seems like there are "must cop" items from each brand, and it felt like an obsession to try and purchase them all. like, sitting down and tallying my purchases made me realize exactly the damage i did in just one (!!) fashion cycle. there are so many seasons and years ahead with so many nice things to buy, if i don't curb or control this behavior it's not going to end well.  i'm not planning to disengage with clothing or fashion as a whole (i really enjoy this as a hobby), but admitting there's a problem is hopefully a good a first step to changing these habits and holding myself accountable to being much more thoughtful and deliberate on my purchases moving forward.	episode_done:True
text:Hiking Aesthetic - Functionality vs. Fashion	labels:Honestly, most people that get serious about hiking learn pretty quickly that fashion is low on the priority list. You can colour coordinate your gear but it's not really going to be fashion.
text:Exactly this truthfully. You start to look at everything your wearing for its physical properties. Something that will keep me 1 degree warmer while not increasing my weight is way more important than any fashion considerations. I'm not even nearly as serious as most people.   Otherwise on casual day hikes I just wear a mix of "normal" clothes and what is most important to me such as shoes and socks.   Not to say you can't go the "other" way with your clothing. I wear my merino wool base layers under regular clothing all the time same with my hiking socks. I also have multiple copies of my hiking pants that I wear both hiking and as casual wear.  I think the only thing that really matters is don't wear cotton/linen/plant fibers hiking, unless your bringing a change of clothes.	labels:	episode_done:True

Maybe I am ill founded in thinking that Raf was capable of understanding a new clientele from the jump, maybe I was taken aback by the lackluster styling, or maybe, just maybe, Raf should actually stick to menswear. This is such a dismal collection, it's making me reconsider purchasing my first piece from him.

So instead of a pencil skirt I’d wear a stretchy tube skirt that functioned like a pencil skirt with more ease. If I wore jeans, I paired it with a blouse and cardigan depending on the weather.   Now I am kinda in hiatus from pencil skirts and that shape altogether. But the same idea applies, add a casual element.    I’ll wear a work friendly skirt on the weekend with a tee shirt, probably a graphic on.  Or a more casual tank top. Today I have on straight jeans and a floral blouse. I like t-shirt dresses, and will pair them with a nicer third piece: cardigan, bomber, or maybe a blazer. I love things like a jersey jumpsuit. Or a knit one.  It has a lot of ease and drape and adds a bit of polish. My “weekend” dresses are the same shapes as the work version, but with a casual fabric. Maybe that means a cotton shirt dress instead of a more structured one.   I wear a lot of flats but have also been embracing Birkenstock’s for some outfits.    My weekend purses still have a bit of structure, because that is my preference.   And to keep my outfits kosher for my casual workplace, I always pair something dressy with something casual. And that is a good rule for weekends too.	episode_done:True

text:A Basic Guide to Useful Knitwear	labels:controversial opinion  but am I the only one who has found knitwear to be more hassle than its worth? They pill easily, can't be hung and need to be stored properly, risk of losing its shape is high, and they can be pretty pricey.  An alternative I've found useful and maybe useful for others.. rather than wearing a sweater over your shirt.  wear one of those uniqlo heat tech under shirts under your shirt.  they have 3 levels of warmth and can get pretty warm. they are also cheap.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 01, 2020	labels:This is a super vague question: my closet is getting pretty full but my mom wants to buy me something nice (budget maybe $100) for Xmas. I pretty much have all the basics that I need and am struggling to think of a good item to ask for. Anyone have any more unique items in that price point that they think a college student might like? Preferably for warmer weather because I am transferring to a college down south (US). I was thinking about a unique pair of pants, perhaps something baggier (since I’m used to slim fit as a 6’1, 160lb guy) or with a unique pattern. Another thing that crossed my mind is corduroy shorts. If anyone has any unique items in their closet that they like, or anything that they think makes a good Xmas gift, please share with me!
text:Honestly, maybe Imm starting to get old, but if I got $100 worth of wool socks for Christmas I’d be very happy	labels:Ha! I’ve done that the last few Christmas’s so I’m stocked up on Darn Tough socks now. Love em although sometimes the extra thick ones are too warm for me	episode_done:True
text:What's your fashion tragedy?	labels:From ages 0 through college. I had such a great body and such tragically bad fashion sense. What a waste!

text:What are some of your least favourite brands?	labels:Everlane. Greenwashed trash.	episode_done:True
text:How do comfort vs. style compare in what bottoms you wear?	labels:Comfort is my top priority when it comes to fashion. I do have some sensory issues, so I wear dresses or skirts almost all of the time because I find the lack of restriction on my legs much more physically comfortable and living in a hot climate, much cooler.   In the past, I sometimes found it hard to figure out what to wear for casual occasions without appearing overdressed. Now, when I want to go for more casual looks or for loungewear I go for one of my casual sundresses or t-shirt dresses that can be paired with sandals. Or I will pair a band t-shirt with a skirt and sneakers to express more personality.  When wearing a dress/skirt would be impractical I end up reaching for shorts. I opt for something in a relatively soft material and that is not overly tight fitting.	episode_done:True
text:What are some habits that keep clothes/shoes new vs that habits that ruin them?	labels:My favorite clothing preservation purchase has been a sweater drying rack. It lets you lay things flat to dry, so no more shoulder stretching battles with the hanger, and I find that things dry faster than when I just fold and hang them. It was one of those random purchase that left me wondering why I waited so long to make it.	episode_done:True
text:Discussion: LGBTQIA+ Signaling, Presentation, and Commodification in Fashion	labels:I am a cishet woman with a very feminine (read: curves) body type, but I prefer athletic clothing or gender neutral styles. I’ve often had people assume my sexuality based on my clothing. I don’t even feel like I actually look like I’m signaling anything except comfy and maybe ready for a pickup game. I don’t think I am appropriating queer looks by any means, if anything I’m trying to appropriate menswear. Which brings us back to the stereotype issue...it’s like “if not overtly feminine, must not date men.” I feel feminine, I’m not trying to be masculine, I just like the straighter cuts of men’s clothing. I also don’t think it’s “bad” to not look “straight”. All looks are good looks if you feel good in them. Now, I’m off to buy more joggers and trainers!  Edit: please check me if I’m wrong here or being insensitive. Not my intent, so I want to make sure I don’t speak in a way that contradicts that intent.	episode_done:True

text:White t-shirt is a good instinct. For shirts you can wear almost anything pastel colored with olive. Also orange looks good, cream, light blue. In colder months a grey or black hoodie underneath is a solid look. For pants I would say darker is a good instinct but neutrals will work too. Navy, black, dark brown (too light looks muddy to my eyes but that’s just me), grey, and I love a white painter pant with light olive jacket as long as you keep the shoes a light tan. Denim works but you can switch it up with some fatigue pants or more casual chinos in the before mentioned colors. I also wouldn’t go too slim because this is a more workwear/military oriented jacket.	labels:Thanks!	episode_done:True
text:Best and Worst Purchase of 2020	labels:[BEST by far](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B07V4PWR35/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_fabc_2cD6FbHCPQKWD?psc=1). Put it this way, I took a chance and purchased one of these velour track suits, then I went back for another, and another and another until I ultimately  ended up (currently) with 5! And I don't even have a black one yet.  The colors are gorgeous, deep jewel tones. I wash them every time I wear them, since I'll wear them during the day, then sleep in the pant with a tee. They show no wear and I've had them since springtime.   They have zipper hoodies and pullovers. The pullovers come with cuffed pants. The zipped ones come with open-bottom legs. By far, the best purchase I've made in ages. They are perfectly fine to wear out without looking like you're wearing your jammies. 5 stars all the way!
text:Yesssss! I’m here for this answer, I just bought myself two velour track suits and I’m impatient for them to arrive. I was “too cool” for the juicy track suits the first time around in the 2000’s, but now that I’m older and don’t give a fuck I’m super excited to try revisiting the trend.	labels:Plus, they don't say something silly on the ass and actually look pretty classy. Pair them with a sweet pair of nice white Keds or Stans or whatever your preference for white sneaks are and you can go anywhere and look put together.	episode_done:True

text:What are the pros and cons of dressing the way that you do?	labels:I’m 33. The past few years I’ve started dressing older. More wool and button up shirts with fitted, straight leg jeans and boots. Less short skirts and skimpy tops, less tops that show a lot of my chest (being small chested this was easy to get away with)  Pro: I find I’m treated more like an adult. 50-60 year olds interact with me more as a peer where before I often felt I was being treated as a kid, even when I was 30.  Con: I feel old sometimes. I feel not fun like my fun festival clothes days are behind me.
text:>my fun festival clothes days are behind me  Ohhh I feel this so much!! I'm a huge music fan and still love the festival vibes, crazy hair, wild fashion, bright colours.

I find that my view of fashion as something I WANT to do, rather than something I HAVE to do, gets pretty drowned out; I can't relate to most comments these days. I don't really value comfort over beauty.  I miss getting to share my hobby and love of clothing with friends and coworkers and baristas and shopkeepers! I'm still dressing up for myself at home every day though even though I haven't left the house in 2 weeks. Dressing up in itself is inspiring to me, so it's not all bad. I used this opportunity to start an Instagram channel as well, which has been super gratifying!

text:AE Elgin - Before & After recraft pics	labels:DIY - a bit of a stretch as I paid for the work, I didn't do the work. I originally tagged as inspiration.   Goal - my brother started his own company. He is doing something very entrepreneurial for the first time in his life and I wanted to give him something that seemed like the kind of thing a business owner might wear. I am proud of him! I specifically selected the Elgin because it is a discontinued model and thought he might enjoy them more knowing you can't go to AE and just buy this shoe.  The details:  1. The Donor Shoe - Allen Edmonds Elgin sz 11.5D.  2. Picked up on Ebay for $18, the photos tell a realistic story of how rough they were. 3. I use Lance from Wyatt & Dad here in Charlotte, NC as my cobbler.  4. The uppers required a full stripping. The normal stuff - the previous owners were using the wrong color polish, seemed to never condition the leather, and there were black spots on the shoes. Don't know exactly what it was.  5. I wanted to give my brother a shoe that is versatile enough to wear to a meeting but a casual reminder that he is now the boss and can set the tone for how he presents himself. I liked the tread pattern because they are similar to another pair of AE Hamiltons that he has. He has always told me he finds them far more comfortable than the traditional leather sole.  6. Met up with Lance and we went through the sole options and I really liked the contrast of the light blue thread with the dark blue military aesthetic sole.  7. Later that day I was hunting around the internet for the right laces and was pleased to discover that Whisker made this design. I liked that the metal aglet matched the rugged feel of the sole design while the light blue matched the casual feel of the rest of the shoe.  8. The only original components from the donor shoe is the upper.  9. All in cost - $18 shoe + $10 S/H + $15 on laces + $176.99 on the total recraft = $223  Style wise: I imagine these to be worn with dark blue jeans and a sport coat. Comfortable enough to wear on a Friday night and with the right shirt they nice enough to wear to a tech startup meeting.

text:The list is basically the full set of colors they would have been able to use when factoring in dye performance (particularly color stability) . It even maps to pre-Twentieth-Century advice on house paint.  There may have been some dyes they could acquire at expense and use on clothing reserved for special occasions (and thus less roughly used), but their association of formality with monochrome obviated such luxuries.

Sizing charts imply that J crew could run a little tight when comparing them, but I am quite skinny so that would surprise me a little. Ironically, I have also seen on internet comments that J.Crew often runs big actually... But maybe that applies to women only??  Hope you can help me. I am holding a purchase right now cause the uncertainty gives me anxiety hahaha  Best regards,  PS: I am size S in most brands (hollister, tommy hilfigher, american eagle..) that makes me think S is always ny best bet, but J.crews size chart on their website seems to run a little smaller across the board when compared to other brands.

text:Winter staples?	labels:I mentioned these in a similar thread recently so please don’t take this as a shill! but Manitobah Mukluks for footwear. They are Indigenous owned, rated to -32C, waterproof, and just downright beautiful. They modern ones have got vibram soles and a replaceable shearling lining, so they’re very comfy and durable. I think they look better than Uggs and they’re designed for the weather to boot (pun intended, heh)   For really cold and snowy days when you’re out shoveling or on the slopes nothing beats a one piece snowsuit.   For winter coats I prefer puffers. I have a thin one that I layer under my wool coat to look stylish and ~professional~ and a thick, long one that I wear alone more casually.   For gloves, my snowboarding gloves are the absolute best. If you use thin gloves for driving and whatnot I recommend merino wool. They can be layered underneath mittens as well.   I am loving the resurgence of long gloves recently, and love wearing thin elbow length ones for style reasons.   I have a nice collection of cashmere/wool sweaters that I’ve thrifted/purchased over the years. One of my secrets is to shop the men’s section. They often have beautiful fabrics in neutral colours that are great for layering.   My last tip is to layer with turtlenecks, bibs, and scarves. I do a few layering tricks that I don’t see many others do, so thought I’d pass them along: - thin turtle neck underneath a collared shirt (my favourite turtlenecks are silk blends)  - add a Dickie or false collar/bib over your sweater for days you need to look put together but don’t want to deal with uncomfortable dress shirt sleeves stuffed under your sweater  - shearling vest, or a cashmere scarf wrapped and belted as a vest
text:Do the winter boots you mentioned have wide sizes that you are aware of by any chance and how much do these warm Manitobah Mukluks cost?	labels:Some styles are on sale right now actually! They range from $100-$400+ a pair in my experience. They‘be gone down in price in recent years from what I can remember.   Mukluks are designed to be tight at first and stretch over time. They don’t have an arch in some styles (the right and left soles are identical actually) so the sheepskin forms to your foot. I don’t think they carry wide sizes, since their shoes are designed to stretch to fit your foot. I usually size up in them and I have normal-wide width feet. Hope that is helpful!	episode_done:True

text:People who used to play super safe with fashion, how did you overcome your fear of bold choices?	labels:I really am not that risky BUT whenever I was wearing something new that I loved but was just scared to wear around people, I’d wear it to a family gathering first. If someone thought it was cute, cool. If someone looked at it like it was weird, cool. It didn’t bother me cause it was my family and they’ve seen me looking really ridiculous before.

text:How do you dress for the (extreme) weather where you're from?	labels:I'm in the Mojave Desert, about an hour and a half away from Death Valley.  It gets in the 120s (49+ celsius), fun stuff.  The soles of your shoes are SO IMPORTANT.  You'd think sandals would work, but you'd be wrong.  When the sole of your shoe is too thin it can actually melt when your walking and mildly burn your feet.  100% cotton, even linin is SO IMPORTANT, synthetic fabrics are cute as hell but on the really hot days will transfer the heat instead of refect it.  White is good, oddly black is better.  What you think of as "hotter" clothes (long-sleeved, black) can help you sweat and keep the sweat on the skin making a personal swamp cooler.  Long sleeves and JEANS are also super important for the sand storms or just stay inside around 2:30-4:00 daily.  Sunglasses are vital!  I have blue eyes, so I'm already sensitive to brightness but any glasses will also shield your eyes from dust kick-ups (and right now, as every year, ash).  &#x200B;  The main priority is just staying cool and not getting burnt.  &#x200B;  Fun info: I started reading the Dune series at the start of this heatwave, HIGHLY recommend.  The idea of "moisture loss" in the book is so spot on.  Out here you feel the moisture escaping from your eyes when you blink and your breath with every exhalation.	episode_done:True

text:What true heirloom pieces do you own and how do you incorporate them into your style?	labels:My heirlooms came from my grandmother, who was 5'2" in heels. I am built the same way, but have more inches than she did... so alas, that gorgeous Burberry trench coat simply cannot be made to fit.   However, Gram was a collector of cashmere and one of those people who believed that if you like a thing, you should have one in every color, and two in the colors you like best, against it wearing out. I have a handful of her sweaters, some of which are from the early 70's. These sweaters were everyday wear for her, and it does show, but they are SO soft and SO luscious that I wear them around the house on a regular basis. My cats don't care that they're two inches too short and have holes at the hem.   I did inherit some of her jewelry, including her engagement ring, which was put in a setting that my grandfather designed. Sadly, resizing the setting to fit me would have destroyed it, so I have that put away until I find a jeweler I trust to make it into a necklace with a new stone. I have an AMAZING opal bracelet of hers, also my grandfather's design, a silver wire cuff with the opals set in as the body of a spider. Gram never told my grandfather that the thought of a spider on her wrist freaked her out- she rarely wore it. I never met my grandfather to tell him how cool I think that piece is. Looks amazing peeking out from under the lace sleeves of my favorite LBD.
text:I’ve also inherited cashmere sweaters in all different colours. My grandma loved turtlenecks though so that’s the only format. On the plus side they don’t have any holes and they fit me just fine.  When I was younger and she gave them to me she would go on about how great the quality was in those sweaters. I, knowing nothing about quality clothing being a teenager, just nodded along and shrugged. Now when I’m older and seen the prizes for new quality cashmere, I feel a lot more appreciative. I’ve made it a point to thrift non-turtleneck cashmere sweaters though.	labels:	episode_done:True

This goes hand in hand with failing prey to various kinds of photography/presentation tricks (being unable to identify that it’s not the clothes that look “cool” here).

text:Are our ideas about what looks “dated” on either ourselves or others affected by or correlated with our age?	labels:I dint know if this will answer your question exactly. I’m 47. By about ten years ago, I had learned what looks really good on me so I stick with those things and don’t really need trends anymore. I might lean into a trendy colour but I stick to the styles that are most flattering. I think it’s just knowledge.  I was never known for being a good dresser as a younger woman but I get a long of nice comments about my style these days.
text:Yes this is the answer.  With age can come an understanding of what silhouettes work on your body.  You also learn what colors look good on you.  It is not a case of being dated, its leaning into your strengths, fashion wise.	labels:And with age can also come IDGAF!  To me it isn't "what colours look good on me", it is "what colours make me look better (IF I ACTUALLY BOTHER TO LOOK IN A MIRROR!!)".  Intentional caps!  It is *I* and not the *clothes* which are supposed to not disappear/look ill.  But then I'm a Little Old Lady who lives in graphic tees/denim shirts/jeans/cargoes/hoodies.  I called my style "children's play clothes", someone else here suggested "carefree minimalist".	episode_done:True

text:What are your tips for being stylish when your weight fluctuates like crazy?	labels:Oh, I feel this so much, I really do  I don't fluctuate quite so dramatically in short time periods, but I definitely do over longer ones, to the point that I own a small but basic wardrobe in sizes XS through XXL, and I'm afraid to get rid of any of it because there's a good chance I'll be back in whatever size it is within a year or two and not have the money to replace it.  Honestly, the biggest thing that has ever helped me is making the switch from pants (even stretchy forgiving pants) to mostly skirts (and some dresses!). Especially ones with elastic waists and especially at the larger sizes, they can just be *so* forgiving of size shifts. I tend towards fuller circle or a-line style skirts, and they can easily accommodate 2-3+ sizes I've found. Nothing else even compares to that degree of flexibility. If I didn't spend most of my time working on physical therapy or trying to move around three rambunctious dogs, I'd still be wearing entirely skirts and dresses now.  Another thing I've noticed is that, even with all my weight fluctuations, I've only gone between two shoe sizes, so that combined with my need for well-fitted and supportive shoes, means I've got a few in both sizes that help me put together outfits.  Otherwise, it's really just been a \*lot\* of buying things secondhand to be honest. And I've had to buy things I don't particularly care for just to have \*something\* that fits and can be workable in the time frame I need it, so now I have the task of going through my sizable wardrobe and weeding out those items and slowly replacing them with things I love, all while trying to guess what size I'll be in the near future.  I don't know that there is necessarily a lot of great advice on how to handle this challenge to be honest. Your style may offer you more options than mine, as I tend to dress to accommodate both a larger bust and a desire to avoid showing much skin up top, which restricts me from things like wrap dresses and such that I've heard are also wonderful for weight fluctuations. Otherwise, barring access to the money to just go out and buy whatever you want when you need it, or to build a set of basics you love in all the sizes, I haven't found a great solution myself to be honest.	episode_done:True

But it's TOO oversized and I'm too short for it.  I'm 5'7" and got the XS/S, but it actually fits like a XL/XXL.  Anyway, can anyone suggest an alternative?  Ideally it would be similar but a better fit, like a brushed flannel/ wool, with a nice plaid pattern, no buffalo.    The ALD [CPO's](https://www.aimeleondore.com/products/wool-overshirt-6) would be perfect, I like how they have side pockets, better tailoring but can still layer underneath, however I'm not trying to spend that much, plus they're sold out anyway.
text:FWIW I'm a fan of shortening the sleeves to fit on oversized garments like this. IMO it gives more of the impression of intentionally oversized than just "too big". I guess hem length also plays a part here though, and I get it if you feel that hem and sleeves are too much to alter.	labels:I thought about that, but then I'd have to do the sleeves, the hem and take it in at the sides.  It balloons too much in the middle.  It's just too much work and I would rather put all of that money into a shirt that fits properly.	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 07, 2020	labels:Are penny loafers suitable for someone who is in their late 20s/early 30s? It is suitable for my dress code at work, smart casual, but I am not sure whether it suits me.  My impression of penny loafers is that it is for the more mature and refined group, perhaps early 40s and above.
text:Penny loafers are a classic Ivy shoe; they were worn by a ton of students at colleges in the mid-20th century. they were considered  a youthful shoe then, and by now fewer younger people wear them. They're very cool if you want to explore the look though, or if you wear mainly basic stuff and want to maybe expand your aesthetic. I wouldn't worry about connotations of "maturity", as they're not a formal shoe- if you're interested in them, go for it!

Otherwise, I'm looking at getting an upgraded watch (from my current Shinola) or perhaps a Loewe bag for my next big milestone.

text:What are the pros and cons of dressing the way that you do?	labels:Pros:  - one time a stranger on the sidewalk told me they like my outfit. I had auburn hair, a black and white striped dress, and a bright yellow cardigan, and cute oxford heels. - I love beanies and winter hats and they are pretty easy to make. I knit and crochet so now I have all the beanies. - I work in tech which tends to be a jeans and polos kind of affair. I once had a coworker say I helped her feel more comfortable wearing skirts and dresses to the office because I always did. - Leg warmers are very practical in the winter.   Cons:  - I still get asked how school is going (I’m 30). - “Aren’t you warm? Why don’t you take off your jacket/sweater/hat?” “Because this is my outfit.” - “Aren’t you cold? Your ankles are exposed and it’s -20 outside.” “This is my outfit.” - I love colours but sometimes my outfit clashes with whatever colour my hair is. - Chunky knit sweaters take up a lot of space.
text:Lol on the comment about your outfits making it more acceptable/not weird for others to wear the same thing in tech. I’ve heard similar sentiments and it’s always a really cute reinforcement and support when going against the grain look wise.   I wish more women in tech felt more comfortable dressing to match their styles if they happen to be non-conformist. I’d love to find more fashion loving techie friends at work.	labels:ya. My first job out of school I was the only woman on a floor of 50-ish men. I think I partly dressed up out of like, rebellion or whatever, because I figured if I’m going to be the only girl on the team then I’m going to be the girliest I can be so that I don’t disappear into the background. I was kind of trying to be the representation I wanted to see or whatever. (Now that I work somewhere that’s majority women in the office I actually dress less girly than I used to).  I like my clothes. I’ve always liked playing dressup. If I’m going to spend 40 hrs a week at work I want to be comfortable there and wear clothes I like.	episode_done:True
text:What is your favorite clothing purchase of the year, and why?	labels:It might be a recency bias talking, but I really love this [18 East sahasika](http://imgur.com/a/QIIh8Q0) that I bought recently.

text:Interesting tie! There looks like a bit of weird wrinkling going on with your right shoulder/arm, but it might just be incidental. My only other suggestion would be to vary the textures a bit more; jacket seems to be a bit similar to the flannels, but that's just my preference.	labels:Thanks! The sleeve pitch on the jacket is slightly off for my build, which is what's causing the wrinkling; but my tailor recommended not to adjust it because that would break the windowpane pattern. It's really only noticeable when I'm standing like that, not really in any other situation. I consider it an acceptable flaw for a $5 thrift find :)	episode_done:True

text:When will I be "too old" to look cute, cool, hip, whatever?	labels:You're overthinking it.  Be comfortable in what you wear and you're always in the right.  The judgements of people that think you look 'too old, cute, cool' etc are, fundamentally, a trap to be stepped over and disregarded.  Those people are a roadblock to true happiness and self-actualization, every single time you see one of them their only function is to stand between you and a good time, telling you about their compiled list of reasons for why this or that thing shouldn't be how *YOU* want it but how *THEY* want it.

You'll get compliments from gen-x'ers because they used to be cool in the 90's, and you'll get compliments from millennials and Gen Z'ers because they're cool again. They're kinda like the band The Pixies. If you know, you know. They're also terribly comfortable and waterproof.  You'll buy 'em and wear them for years.   People will talk about how they're different now and not as good as before but even this new version are still high quality to me. I wear [this pair](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pinterest.com%2Fpin%2F654570127070834072%2F&psig=AOvVaw2G4DCAafxUzdLn3d3X6JTS&ust=1609867019606000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAIQjRxqFwoTCJi9z5Dkgu4CFQAAAAAdAAAAABAM) with everything.

text:Buying vs selling on resell websites	labels:Was it the Wired article? If so, I know the author.  I sell on Poshmark, mostly to pass along things I'm no longer wearing, and I've found it satisfactory. When I shop there, it's for something very specific. I personally don't engage with other sellers, aside from following a shop that has things I like. My experience is limited, but I've found it helps to have more niche items, versus tons of things from more mainstream stores. My goal is usually to make enough to buy something to replace the item I sold, or I'll save up my balance until I want or need something. It's definitely not an income-maker for me, and I like ethical and smaller fashion, so the things I've posted usually sell fairly quickly.
text:I think the key to making money on poshmark is having rare or coveted items for niche buyers versus a shit ton of banana republic work dresses	labels:It depends. Rare/expensive items sell for a lot, but they don't sell very often. As you can imagine, most people don't have a few hundred/thousand to spare to shell out for things like that very often. So it can be good to have a mix of items--high value, slow selling items that will drive traffic to your closet, and lots of low value, fast sellers that keep you moving.  Some closets do specialize, but you need a lot of starting capital and/or a reliable source, which is getting into /r/Flipping territory.	episode_done:True
text:How many clothes do you have? (Really?)	labels:Age: mid-twenties. Location : England ( 4 seasons, all rainy) 10 dresses, 11 tops, 2 trousers, 3 skirts, 11 knitwear, 4 outerwear and 9 shoes.  Total: 50, by accident hahaha. Oh! And 5 tops, 1 trousers, 2 shoes and 1 cardigan for work!  I have quite a ~quirky~ style which I think bumps up my numbers, and I love shoes to keep like 5 pairs I barely wear.	episode_done:True
text:Are our ideas about what looks “dated” on either ourselves or others affected by or correlated with our age?	labels:I'm 26 and I love vintage styles, so I definitely don't mind wearing "dated" clothing.
text:Maybe this is part of the answer - on young women, vintage clothes look like a deliberate fashion choice, but someone might think an older women wearing the same has just not updated their style lately. I don't ascribe to this, btw, but I could see someone who doesn't know much about trends cutting a lot more slack for retro vibes from younger people vs older people.	labels:I'm in my early 30s. There are a few things I just kept wearing from the first time around because i like them, and I'm not the trendiest person, but I am not dressing exactly the same. I haven't (usually) been repeating entire outfits since 2005 or 2010, for example, and I style my hair and change my makeup every so often. I've got a few friends from way back who do look stuck in our 6th form/uni days - one is still doing full on ModCloth/Etsy/40s hair twee, a couple could have walked out of 2010 Pinterest, and one still wears his whole JNCO/chain/spiky hair get up...and they do look dated because they've just settled on the same hair, makeup, the whole look. The thing is, to me, that's just how they look, those are just outfits, unless I really think about it and realise it was X Years ago I actually saw something for sale or multiple people wearing it. It's true that it just gets harder to keep up when you hit a certain life stage - you get a job, get busy, maybe have kids and suddenly it's 2020 and hipsters were 10 years ago and before it was cool was like, 2008 : (	episode_done:True

text:What can I wear when I have a medical issue that makes my waistline change a lot?	labels:I'll just write a couple of ideas. Don't know if any will be useful but anyway:  * Elasticated waistband. Drawstrings are more prevalent and easy to come by, but paper bag pants might be an option to consider.  * Looser fits. [Picture as an example] (https://imgur.com/a/mGAeEYZ)    * Different materials. Linen and wool might be more comfortable than jeans.  * See which rise works better for you. You might find that low rise pants might be better for your situation.  Edit: I feel that pants like [1](https://i.pinimg.com/474x/ff/2c/49/ff2c49fe781c6be53cec3842b7b74f02.jpg) [2](https://i.pinimg.com/474x/76/ea/2b/76ea2b1888f06a9b76b8b96e45912ff2.jpg) [3](https://i.pinimg.com/474x/04/c0/83/04c083fd9fbcdb30ee6e06cf1f928b51.jpg) would work well.

text:How has the quality changed over the years at some of your fav brands?	labels:So forever 21 used to be my favorite brand/store to shop at, and I'm honestly not quite sure if it's because I've grown older and started to notice quality or what, but I feel like the quality has gone way down.   Nowadays I 90% thrift, but whenever I do decide to enter a forever 21, I feel like everything is so cheap (also the store is just plain overwhelming) compared how it used to be when I shopped as a teenager. I'm honestly not sure if that's because of trends or markets or because I got older and started noticing it more.  I guess at the thrift store I'm exposed to several other brands that I can feel the difference between the two, but that's my best guess. So I don't think it's necessarily gone downhill, but it's more like I started noticing the actual quality in comparison to others.
text:Quality and style have both dipped, imo. A decade ago I was constantly being pleasantly surprised by pieces I would find there. Yeah there was plenty of shoddy stuff too, but it was a decent mixture of clothes only teens would wear and reasonably well-made items adults could pull off.  Around the same time my local store reopened as a Red store, maybe three-ish years ago, those great finds completely disappeared. It's been forever (no pun intended) since I've seen anything worth wearing from that brand.	labels:I really miss their Love 21 line. It was slightly more expensive but had cute, high quality items for a fast fashion line.	episode_done:True

text:What style rules or clothing attributes are you ruthless about?	labels:Nothing that needs to be dry cleaned except winter coats. Hate the smell, hate the bother, hate the expense.  No glitter, no metallic thread. I like it on other people, but on me it makes me feel like I’m wearing a costume. Sequins and paillettes only on formal evening wear (for me).  No dolman sleeves (for me). I don’t like how they look on my busty inverted triangle shape.
text:I'm the same when it comes to laundry.  My winter coat is the only thing that goes to the cleaners (once a year after the season is over).  I won't wear anything that I cannot machine wash or requires extra care.  The most extra care I'm willing to give something is washing in a mesh bag.	labels:Same! My wool coat is the only thing I dry clean, and honestly it’s every couple of years. I’ll buy things that have a dry clean only tag, but I wash them with my other clothes and hang them to dry.	episode_done:True

I bought a couple pairs and they lost their elasticity after a while. The traveler jeans hold their shape much better, but are pretty thin and I actually wore a hole through mine in about 2 years with regular wear. Either go for the "luxe" traveler (more expensive and thicker) or Rapid Movement.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else use a “formula” to create their outfits?	labels:Growing up, my grandmother always taught me this rule: remove one piece of jewelry before leaving the house.   She acted like it was a common rule - less is more. I've never listened to it because then I would never wear any jewelry, lol. I love jewelry but I have a minimalist style.  My own formula is to wear either a necklace or earrings, but never both.	episode_done:True

Oh and I also hate the tops that are split at the back. I’m sick of seeing them everywhere. At first I thought I liked it, but it turns out I don’t! I hate any sort of cut out in anything, apparently.
text:I think we should progress the cold shoulder trend to the next level to satisfy the ~miniMal*sustainable~ market now: only shoulder tops.

I checked his closet and his pants range from 30-1/32 size but he always has to cuff his pants (for reference he’s 179/5’9 and 68/150 lbs). Would a 30 inch be better? Do guys prefer shorter pants?   Also, he’s been losing a little weight because he’s not able to workout as much (pandemic) and so I feel like a small would fit him for shirts a lot more well than a medium (his usual size). Would this make him feel insecure?? I genuinely just want him to feel confident in these new clothes so I wanna get the best fit for him... any and all comments/advice would be so appreciated. Thanks and have a great day!! :))
text:It’s extremely hard to size for someone else and I think this is why clothes are generally a poor gift, unless the person has asked for a specific item.  It might be better to give cash/gift card and offer to go shopping with them (assuming your can shop in person where you are).	labels:	episode_done:True
text:General Discussion - January 18, 2021	labels: Devoured Pressfield's "The War of Art" (it's only like a 100 pages tbh). Bit weirded out by some of the religious stuff and would've been more immersed if words like "Angel" were substituted for something else, but if you think of them as metaphors like he suggests it def still works. Also IIRC the book treats some Jungian psychology pretty much as fact which was odd, but even those parts are useful if you don't take them literally.      I thought the last page where he talks about (minor "spoilers" ahead) owing the world your art was incredible. Also the advice that you just have to sit down and start somewhere and things suddenly start working out was something I most def already knew, but I think seeing it written down helps a lot. All in all I am extremely motivated to get shit done (sew).

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 07, 2021	labels:Never been much of a fashionable person myself, but I've been looking for a pair of pants that doesn't make me feel as uncomfortable as jeans do. I have bad sensory issues and I generally just wear shorts because of how the denim feels to me. I generally just go back and forth to work and my dresscode is just wear the company's shirt while being free with whatever pants you like to wear provided they are black. Any pointers to look in the right direction? Perferably something with 40x36 among the sizes.

text:Review your winter 2020/2021 outerwear: how did your coats and sweaters hold up this season? Would you recommend your specific brand to someone looking for warm layers. Did you add anything new to your winter wardrobe that stands out?	labels:My Marmot Montreaux started to lose some feathers and the zipper broke last month (4 years old). I was in love with it, could wear it with just a t-shirt the inside was so soft, the pockets lined, two inside pockets, knee length. It really made the NYC winters less miserable.  I was thinking about mixing it up and trying the Patagonia Down With It Parka since they seem pretty comparable and I like Patagonia as a brand, but ended up getting Uniqlo Ultra Light Down Hooded Coat because of the great reviews and that it was only $60!!! I figured since I'm not going out a bunch and waiting on the subway platform anymore I didn't need to spend $300 this (unemployed) year. It's definitely not as warm but is totally fine even in the higher 30s if I layer up. I really love how light it is too.	episode_done:True
text:Article: Why Is Fashion So Beige This Season?	labels:I know this is controversial, but I honestly miss the early 2000s trends. Of course I’d never dress like that now, but there was something so happy and innocent about a time when everything was bedazzled and bright.

text:What did your mom teach you about fashion/style - and what did she not teach you?	labels:I’m a mother of a thirteen year old, and she knows what she loves and doesn’t.  Do I think her super heavy cat eye looks great?  Well not really, it’s kinda messy.  But she’ll get there right?  Do I love the one dot of eyeliner she puts under eyelid.  No.  What is that?  But it makes her happy.  She’s super petite and her size M t shirts and mom jeans drown her frame, but she says she can’t stand if a shirt is tight on her arms.  I don’t have a lot of rules for her choices.  General modesty rules.  She’s an artist and musician and super creative.  She shows that creativity through her outfits.  I had a mom like you, who didn’t really show me the importance of looking nice.  But still, I can’t bring myself to give my daughter instructions.  I seriously can’t wait to see how she grows in her choices.  I’m not saying this is right, just what I’ve chosen to do with my own daughter.
text:My mom had a similar attitude to yours. She let me do whatever as a young kid because she figured she’d save her energy for when I was 16 and trying to go out in a too short skirt. I still struggled with body issues and self concept at times but we never ended up fighting her about a mini skirt and I could talk to her when I wasn’t feeling great about myself. Looking back i looked really ridiculous at times but the pictures are funny and my mom and I have a pretty good relationship still.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What is your "White Whale" fashion product that apparently doesn't exist?	labels:A black leather Chelsea boot for my girlfriend. I’ve wanted to gift her a pair for years now. The closest I’ve come is one of the Everlane models. I saw this girl wearing these amazing Chelsea boots in Portland. I should have asked her but I was with my gf and it would have been awkward. Lol.  Open to recs! Girlfriend shops at Madewell a lot of that’s any reference for her style.

text:Discussion: LGBTQIA+ Signaling, Presentation, and Commodification in Fashion	labels:I think the question of what role the media has in stereotypes of LGBTQIA fashion is interesting. From the lesbian/WLW perspective, I feel like the majority of WLW depicted in contemporary media skew far more feminine than the majority of WLW I know in real life. And for what it's worth, I don't think that's 100% about the fashion, exactly? I think there's a #vibe that many WLW have in person that doesn't translate to our on-screen depictions, particularly when the actor is presumably straight. A *lot* of bi and lesbian women I know who do dress in a very feminine way kind of offset that in some other way - a style of walking (there's a lesbian walk, I *swear*), interacting with the world, idk.  I was going to say that I don't feel pressure to dress a certain way, but I think I do sometimes and I just ignore it. The style of dress doesn't come from media or a desire to signal, it comes from my city's stereotypical "queer fashion" that has just blended into broader alternative fashion (not emo etc., just... not normie). Part of the reason I don't dress like that is that I literally do not think it would look good on my body. The other part, I think, is that I do gain a lot of benefits from moving through the world dressed in a way that has plausible deniability regarding my sexuality. Other WLW are more likely to pick up on other signals (aforementioned ways of existing in the world), but I *like* being able to choose who I do and do not tell. I think I feel more pressure to be the "blatantly gay, take it or leave it" type of WLW, and the fashion folds into that. (And I want to make it clear that in this context I'm not talking about dressing in a masc or butch way, because I have butch friends who dress entirely differently than the local subculture/community I was talking about.)  Edit: Editing to say that one signal I don't personally use but will always love is the carabiner of keys hooked to the belt loop. Chef's kiss.
text:>	A lot of bi and lesbian women I know who do dress in a very feminine way kind of offset that in some other way - a style of walking (there’s a lesbian walk, I swear), interacting with the world, idk.  this just reminded me of an ex I had in college who, when I asked her how she knew I was queer (I’m pretty femme and generally perceived as straight unless I’m with a more-queer-looking friend), said “straight women don’t carry themselves that way.” I’ve been trying to figure out what that means since, and why she could pick up on it when like, 90% of people apparently can’t.	labels:NOTICE ME, SENPAI! 😫	episode_done:True
text:General Discussion - November 16, 2020	labels:Wow these fits are hard to take seriously. Oh, what’s that? What do *I* wear? I dress in color with modern cuts. What are modern cuts, you ask? How do you not know? You fool. They have good colors. They have *modern* cuts. What are you not getting? They’re unlike the shit colored trash bag silhouettes you all wear. And by all, I mean *ALL*. There’s no variance, no personality in any of your echo chamber outfits. My friends and I used to dress like this 10 years ago anyways. Not only are these cuts not modern, but, even worse, they’re unoriginal.   ^ an aggregate of my favorite lurker takes in the fit battle thread. Can we get a lurkerbot made?

Given the overlap of brands and the shared focus on utility, lines between the two can feel blurry.   To me it the biggest difference between them is the attitude--one is warm, goofy and carefree, while the other is cool, solemn and cryptic. Dad jokes vs aloof one liners.

text:Can I see your casual natural-fabric outfits?	labels:I have been only buying natural materials this year as well. I'm not sure if denim gives you a sensory issue but I have found that a lot of men's and boys jeans are still all cotton. Depending your sizing and preferred fit, you could look for those. Otherwise I like linen pants a lot (pantsfessional on IG has some great looks). My other suggestion is to look in thrift stores, a lot of women's clothing used to be all natural materials so I have had more luck there with donated items.
text:How do you deal with wrinkles in linen pants? Do you stick to linen blends? Or are you just very careful not to wrinkle them?	labels:Unfortunately there is no way to avoid wrinkles in linen, but I think that's part of the look and just embrace it. I start the day with unwrinkled pants (steamer works great but honestly just hanging them up gets them pretty smooth) and the creases that develop are at joint lines. I think that those wrinkles from natural wear look neater than the wrinkles from something that has obviously been crumpled in a heap. My linen does tend to be heavier weight so they arent the super gauzy type, and they fit further away from the body which it think wrinkles them a little less.	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- October 23	labels:Hi,   I'm looking for a warm winter boot recommendation as I live in Minnesota. I want a pair of boots that comes in black and around the $200.00 mark. Last year i used 6-inch Timbs and Nike AF1 boots for the winter. The timbs were great on ice but not very warm. The AF1 books weren't very good on the ice.  I'm looking for something semi-fashionable. What I mean by that is not a muck workboot or something. I won't be out in the snow working or anything, just need something warm enough and good enough w/ sidewalk snow/ice when I have to walk a few blocks.  I like the Sorel MENS CHEYANNE II LACE DUCK BOOT , but I'm reading that the quality is crap now. That the toe area is cracking for a lot of people.  LL Bean has the warmer duck boots, but they don't come in black.  Any recommendations?
text:Heavyweight Terry wool boot socks are the secret for warmth.

I actually just bought a monsoon coat that is pretty much a copy of an Alexander McQueen coat Kate wore   I guess in my head there is no world in which I will ever buy a 10k coat, so buying a cheaper dupe isn’t taking business away from anyone. I have also bought bespoke clothes on Etsy that are versions of outfits a famous person wore and are advertised as such, in that case I’m actually supporting a small business but they’re technically “stealing” the idea. So I don’t know what’s right!  What is the difference between a dupe and a knockoff is an interesting question
text:Yes this! I bought the Aritzia coat that is pretty much a straight up dupe of the Max Mara Madame. There are cheaper wool dupes, and even cheaper blended fabric dupes. It's a giant camel coat available at many price points. That said it really bugs me when a giant global retailer steals independent artists work. That's really not cool.

I also wouldn’t mind a resurgence in pink/sparkly accessories (but perhaps slightly more subtle this time around). If there’s a way for designers to “tone down” the 2000’s, I could actually see this trend being sort of fun. Like Lizzie McGuire in her 30s.	episode_done:True

Tired of having collars that go limp after a few washes, completely losing their structure no matter how or what I do, they’re just cheap. Tired of buying black shirts that start to resemble a brown or purple more so than black. Tired of various “shades” of black but I guess this just depends on the materials used.   Anyway I want to buy shirts that will last and give me the professional look. I now want to dress like I could meet a future wife or new career opportunity when I’m out.

text:General Discussion - November 30, 2020	labels:<rant>  If I said "Wear cropped jackets so you look taller" I'd be laughed out of the room but somehow "Short people shouldn't wear long coats" is a valid thing?   Also what's defined as short? If someone is 5'7" do they get to wear long coats? What if they're 5'7.5"??  It also throws the idea out the window of the whole horizontal breaks thing that people complain about for cropped trousers or high-waisted pants. Suddenly you have a wonderful garment type that can give you long, **tall**, and elegant lines and it's impossible to wear.   People complain all the damn time about menswear being too "restrictive" and women's wear being more "exciting" but everyone is too much of a wimp to wear a ~ L O N G C O A T ~.  I fucking hate fashion "rules" and "guidelines" and literally everything having to do with the word "flattering". If you care so much about these gender norms, masculinity and being ~ flattering ~ then sack up and wear the clothes you like.   That whole thread is just people saying that someone else told them they couldn't *wear a coat* so what should they do? Oh idk. How about tell them to fuck off and wear the damn coat.  </rant>

text:General Discussion - January 19, 2021	labels:Well, I've been keeping strict quarantine ever since March 24. I only leave home for work and that's it. Every month or so I meet up with some friends while keeping the safety guidelines: we meet up in open spaces, always keep our masks on, keep safe distance, etc. But other than that I'm home stuck; I haven't set foot in a restaurant, café, mall, movie theater or whatever in almost a year. Some may think this a bit too extreme, and it may be, but I live with family members that may be more susceptible to COVID so we can't take any risks.  Before the pandemic one of my favorite things to do was grab a book, hop into my car and drive aimlessly to see where I ended up. I normally settled down in a café to read or I stopped by a bite someplace I hadn't been before.   I'm a homebody but even I have my limits, so as of late I've been wanting to leave the house and once again wonder around. Maybe I'll do it this weekend. This time around I'll avoid indoor places and just stick to open places, like parks. I'm planning to follow the safety guidelines and everything, but I still can't help but feel selfish. What if unknowingly I'll expose my family to COVID? One part of me feels like I'm overreacting, I mean, everybody I know is going on with their lives and they seem fine. But I can't seem to shake off this latent fear. Maybe the pandemic has affected me in ways that I'm just starting to notice.

text:(UPDATE) Ladies who miss fashion/makeup/getting dressed up... how are you doing?	labels:I get super depressed every time I go to Target because their Prologue line, along with a few others, are absolutely crushing it right now, and it would just be a waste of money for me to buy that gorgeous puff sleeved minidress I’ve been after all my life, because I have nowhere to wear it.   I still put on makeup because I do an insane amount of virtual meetings, but I just can’t find it in me to also put on my fabulous silver cowboy booties (my home is carpeted) or throw on a funky slip dress and blazer because it just feels weird to wear them around the house.   I’m trying. But fuck I miss fashion so much. Fashion and live music were my top 2 hobbies. I’ve had a ROUGH year.	episode_done:True
text:How do some people put outfits together so effortlessly. Fashionista's please help.	labels:I use google slides to play around with outfit combinations. I have been in the habit of collecting images of every piece of clothes I buy, and putting it into a presentation. Then it's just a matter of copying/pasting and playing around on "paper" to see what combos tickle my fancy, and map out what I'm going to wear/what I actually wore. I also take notes on how I felt in the outfit, and what I might change about it in the future.   I like to keep in mind-- "texture, pattern, color, shine." I prefer outfits that have at least 2 or 3 of those qualities. So if it's a monochromatic outfit, it better have differing textures and some shine somewhere.   Textures include - suede, fur, nubbly wool, cashmere, velvet, tweed, leather, silk, etc. Shine includes your silver and gold metals, but also satin, patent leather.   Don't be too shy of pattern. Even if you don't like bold patterns or busy patterned tops, you can add a small dose of pattern in your shoes or a scarf or a bag. But pattern mixing can be a ton of fun! Subtle microcheck pants are a safe place to start.   I also keep in mind "structure." Even the loosest, baggiest fashions have some sort of structure somewhere, it could be as simple as where the arm sleeve or hem ends (your bare arms/ankles are then the structure). Or higher armholes/tight long sleeves/turtleneck/exposed collar bones could be the structure. Or adding structure via a topper -- a structured blazer over a loose flowy top or dress. Or a belt, but that's too obvious, heh.  The "third piece" is also a good trick. I.e., layer for interest. That could be a topper, but even if you are in a tropical clime, you can add a third piece in the form of earrings or bracelets or necklace or head scarf.   Shoes can make all the difference. I know we are in the "white sneakers with everything" mode right now, but beyond that, branch out with your footwear and don't just limit yourself to boring black. Here is an easy opportunity to add color, shine, texture, pattern. I once challenged myself to ban all black footwear from my closet and I went several years -- it opened up my style quite a bit. I have red suede, leopard print, metallic, snake print, and so on.   Understanding what colors flatter you helps a lot. Whether you go full on into color theory or not, it helps to know at least whether you are cool, warm, neutral and high/low/medium contrast. That doesn't mean you have to ban unflattering colors completely -- it just means you need to put more thought into balancing them out in your outfits.   Contrast is interesting and often overlooked. I am medium contrast. If I wear an entirely low contrast or entirely high contrast outfit, something feels off. One way to fix this is to simply add a medium-wash denim jacket, or medium contrast scarf.   And of course fit is above all else. There's ample advice out there for what to wear depending on what shape you are (pear, apple, hourglass, rectangle, inverted triangle), which can be a good place to start. I think it also helps to take a look at your vertical proportions -- are you high or low waisted? Long torso/short torso? Proportionately short or long legs? Then play around with your hems -- roll up the sleeves of your tee / pin up the hem of your dress and figure out your sweet spot. Simple adjustments can make a big difference. It can also help to take out your most flattering and comfortable pants or jeans and measure the front and back rise to discern what "high waisted" vs "low waisted" means for you.	episode_done:True

text:Which higher end brands do you find to be "worth it" and for what?	labels:I love comfortable shoes. Aquazzura has comfortable, stylish heels. Eileen Fisher has less stylish, more comfortable shoes. I have not been impressed with Cole Haan lately. (I have loafers that are 5 years old that are comfortable, and shoes that are 2 years old that I regret buying.) I also like Lanvin shoes, but only have two pairs so not sure if my experience can be applied to all their shoes.  I hate Chanel espadrilles. They're insanely uncomfortable.  I don't like Commes des Garcons clothes are worth it. They feel like fast fashion quality with their brand slapped on.   Loro Piana cashmere is a fucking dream, but $$$$$$.   I have a Burberry leather jacket and the leather is nice. I can't speak to its durability because I've only worn it a handful of times.   Most of my every day clothes come from COS and Allsaints (on sale). Durable and drapes nicely at a reasonable price.
text:I never heard of Aquazzura before!! I looked through their selection and they have the prettiest heels but are so expensive 😱😭	labels:Yup! And it's a popular enough brand that there are superfakes out there, so I don't buy secondhand. Aquazzura is a once-every-few-years treat for me, but it's so worth it because their heels are comfortable. I rarely wear heeled shoes now, but I have no trouble going all day in Aquazzura block heels.	episode_done:True

text:What do you think about the Guernsey re: fit/quality? Considering picking one up	labels:Absolutely do pick one up! They're lovely.  It's a very tight weave so they're quite heavy and warm and fit rather snugly. But that's just how they're supposed to be. Also pretty water- and windproof.  They're a bit scratchy so maybe wear something long-sleeved under it.   I recommend getting one from Le Tricoteur. The're a lovely little company near Fort Grey and imo make the highest quality Guernseys you can get. Should you be able to go there in person I recommend it. You get a little in-store discount on the sweaters. Also they carry seconds there which are even cheaper.  When I went there in 2018 I had taken a fall from a close call with a madwoman in a camper, so we left our bicycles in Forest. My girlfriend and I the walked down there and both bought a sweater (seconds). Neil was so nice to take us back up to our bikes in his van. They're a lovely company that make the best guernseys around.  I recommend adhering to the measurements and recommendations on their website. That should be pretty accurate.	episode_done:True

text:Does anyone else feel that nothing is unfashionable nowadays?	labels:I distinctly remember in the late 90s my mum saying exactly the same thing. This was because she could remember growing up in the late 1970s and early 80s where silhouettes were much more restricted in terms of what was considered current. Like one year everybody would wear knee length skirts, the next year it was short skirts, then it was maxi skirts. I would probably argue that this was the case up until the 1990s when suddenly there was much more diversity in terms of women’s fashion and probably more overt referentiality to past styles than there had been previously. Fashion also became much more aesthetically fragmented. There’s like the mainstream, macro fashion trends but then also different communities and groups develop their own aesthetics and fashion language. Hence it feels like anything goes, but it doesn’t really... it’s all about signalling to the right group of people that you belong with them and the rules are constantly changing. Power and prestige exist in being able to transgress the codes enough to move aesthetics forward while still obeying the general sensibilities. As cities grow bigger there is more access to people who will have increasingly niche interests and lifestyles. Like I will not really understand subtle signifiers of status and power in the corporate sector, because this is not my domain. Similarly, a corporate person would be totally out of place in the world I work in. Unless, we lived in the same area and took our kids to the same playground, in which case there would be a particular parent-in-park set of fashion conventions we would both likely adhere to. If we went to a different area, these would likely change.  Edit: thank you for the awards kind humans of Reddit!

text:For the $16 difference, no. Uniqlo is better, but not buy it for life level. Either wait until you can order more, or grab the Target shirt.

text:FAQ: What is the environmental impact of different fabrics?	labels:I think a proper answer to this question would require a research team, a lot of money, and a lot of time. Here's some top-level things I know about various fabrics/materials:  * Cotton requires a lot of water to become a fabric. Especially anything that's "washed" like non-raw denim. (See Levi's Water-less line) * Any synthetic fabrics are made from fancy plastic and release micro plastics into the water every time you wash them. Even the tees and fleeces that are made from recycled plastics. There are [bags](https://www.patagonia.com/product/guppyfriend-washing-bag/GP001.html) and filters you can buy which supposedly cut down on the amount of micro plastics that actually make it into the water supply. I can't speak at all to how effective they actually are.  * Leathers of any kind require a lot of water and various "chemicals" to tan. Vegetable tanning is generally regarded as ~~better~~ less bad than chrome tanned leathers. * The excuse that "leather is a by-product of the meat industry" is basically a dumb trick of economics and the definition of "by-product". Meat is a larger industry and is more popular than leather so cows that are raise are more or less called "angus/beef" cows instead of "leather" cows because most of the money in them comes from the meat and not the hides. Farmers still make money off of selling the hides and such. If everyone stopped eating beef overnight then leather would no longer a by-product it'd be the main product. Don't get sucked into this excuse. * Fabric treatments, in general, are "bad". Waterproofing, non-iron, etc. * Washing clothes is "bad". Similar to how the majority of the environmental footprint of combustion engine cars comes from after they're sold, a large part of the environmental footprint of clothing comes from once it reaches your house. More specifically when you wash your clothes. Lots of washers aren't high-efficiency and use a lot of water, more energy if you don't wash on cold, dryers use a ton of energy, etc.   Hopefully someone else can talk about wool. I personally know nothing about it.  This is all really surface-level takes and there's more than enough nuance to go around that I've avoided in this comment. As always, if your primary goal is to have a small environmental footprint, there's a reason the order is reduce, reuse, recycle. Buy less.

text:What are your thoughts on outfit repeating multiple days in a row?	labels:During a conversation with coworkers at work (pre-Covid-19) I joked about doing this as an experiment, wearing a repeated outfit multiple days in a row at my work office, to see if anyone would notice and comment on it. A female coworker said straight up, "maybe the males would not notice". Based on her comment and the tone, I think I would be judged, especially by the women at the office, if I actually tried it. So yes, I believe there was pressure. I wonder, is it considered unprofessional to dress with repeated outfits or in a "uniform"? For women especially?
text:I feel like it would be more accepted to go full uniform, because people would assume you own multiple copies of the same pieces, and uniforms tend to be very neutral-based (from what I've read, not sure if this is broadly accurate). To me it doesn't make sense for a uniform to be acceptable but the "in-between" of outfit repeating to not be. Though TBH, I've never worked with anyone who was committed to a uniform, maybe they would be judged just as much as an outfit repeater.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:I want to eliminate the need for dry cleaning my work wardrobe. Sadly, anything nice seems incompatible with machine wash. What long lasting, work pieces have been easiest for you to maintain?	labels:When I was working, my business casual wardrobe consisted of Ponte pants from White House Black Market, several fine-gauge merino, cashmere, and yak wool sweaters and cardigans from MUJI, a couple drapey merino cardigans from Icebreaker, and a few Synthetic shells from Ann Taylor. Everything was machine washable, air dry. Accessories like scarves and statement jewelry made things more interesting. (I traveled a lot for work as well, so I also needed to pack this stuff and have it be non wrinkly at the destination.)

text:Who is your ultimate style icon?	labels:Brigitte Bardot, Audrey Hepburn, Grace Kelly, Rachel from Friends, Rosie Huntington Whitely.

text:Your 2021 trend predictions?	labels:The style of 2020 was so much more feminine and romantic than the trends of the previous couple decades, so it'll be interesting to see how this rediscovery of feminine softness will influence things going forwards. As others have said I think there will be more focus on beautiful and dainty ornamentation paired with simpler slightly more fitted garments of natural fibre. Pants and skirts sitting on the hips bones rather than being high waisted. Floral and nature inspired patterns and jewellery, I'm thinking the painting of Ophelia by Millais. But maybe at the same time there will be a swing away from this sweet, innocent look with more psychedelic, rave culture, lsd and 1960s art nouveau appropriation poster aesthetics emerging. I think this kind of psychedelic combination of delicate "nature goddess" looks with more vivid colours, trippy prints and interesting details will start to emerge.  Honestly I'm hoping some of the slow fashion, "timeless", ethical (and expensive) clothing that has been cool for the last 5 years will finally start to mean that people actually do buy less stuff and the fast fashion cycle will slow down with changes being more in the realm of accessories and hair than in buying tonnes of clothing itself.... But probably not right...   On another note: nike AF1s (and vejas) are surely done by now, and maybe this is wishful thinking but I feel the cool sneaker trend cycle might fizzle out a bit, with more trad leather and cute heels and basic canvas shoes coming in... Anyone here got speculation on what the new cool shoe will be?

text:What did people *actually* wear in 2000's?	labels:Well most cycles of fashion is a new take on an era, not an exact replica, so authentic 2000s wouldn’t be in style, but a 2020 take on it would.   I was in college and we wore low rise flares and tight fitting long tops. I mean, we wanted to look like we had the longest torso and lowest butt ever!!! It was a time to be alive. We wore shiny shit to the clubs and our moms told us not to look like we were wearing our jammies because it was all lingerie-looking.   We lived for a layered look but a fuckin stupid one, like a cami over a t shirt. Or a scarf with a tank top.  I even wore a skirt over JEANS and they were flared wtf.

text:DAE feel a disconnect between fashion you see in movies or TV and fashion you see in real life?	labels:I see stuff and think “that is so cute, I want it!” But I feel like it just wouldn’t look good on me. Very insecure when it comes to clothing and what looks good and what doesn’t.
text:That’s where I’m at, too. There is a lot of fashion I would like to try out but when you see it on a perfect body, it suddenly doesn’t look so great in your own mirror. Just a confidence issue, but it’s still a bit discouraging.	labels:Keep in mind many of those models still have their clothes pinned and tucked to them in all of the right places.

text:How do you think access and privilege affect your taste and sense of style?	labels:I grew up in a very large, poor family. I am only now (22ish) considering what my personal style is. Even in HS I didn't have the money or time to be able to make my own choices and ended up wearing whatever was gifted/thrifted/passed down to me.  I think I am drawn to really high-end long lasting pieces because those are the items I could never afford, but they also last so I don't have to repurchase clothing every year	episode_done:True

text:Are our ideas about what looks “dated” on either ourselves or others affected by or correlated with our age?	labels:Oh this is interesting! I've actually been thinking a lot about this. I'm 44, and interested in fashion as an historian, and also have been rewatching a bunch of movies from the early 2000s-2010 lately and wondering about how dated the clothes look to my eyes vs a younger person's.      Three thoughts (from the perspective of a person interested in, but not IN the fashion world and not super stylish):   1. I think there is a certain tendency, as you get older, to get less concerned about style trends because you start to see things come and go. When you're in your late teens, you wouldn't be caught DEAD in something unstylish. You're so caught up in the zeitgeist that you "get" perfectly what current style means, and things that are out of style are really ugly and uncomfortable for you. (Not everyone; there will always be people who like to be out of sync or quirky or oppositional. I'm talking about ppl interested in Fashion here.) As you get older, you witness the cycle where the Super Hot Thing is suddenly . . . gone, and the Horrible Unfashionable Thing is now HOT (ahem: SCRUNCHIES), and around again, and you can't help but take shit less seriously. "Dated" is not as serious an insult; you have a bit of a broader view. I'm not really defending wearing the same clothes for 30 years, just explaining why older women feel less frantic about wearing unstylish things.      2. Time also speeds up as you get older. I was watching the movies circa 2010 (which, incidentally, do NOT hold up; so much more casual sexism!!), and had a hard time telling much difference in the clothes. But 10 years ago doesn't seem that long ago to me. I've been reading the threads on skinny jeans and realizing that I still think of skinny jeans as a "recent" development. If you're 25, skinny jeans have been in style your whole adult life and 10 years was AGES ago. I saw a photo of myself wearing a certain top from 5 years ago and realized I still thought of it as a "new" top, lol. My point is, we have to work harder to think "current."     3. I also want to point out: our goal as women should not be to look "young" if we're not. Some of the criticisms of older women wearing "dated" clothes are about those women "showing their age." Well, what of it? I'm 44. I earned every year of my life. I don't need to look like a 25 year old. 25-year-olds look beautiful, fresh, amazing in this year's styles. I don't need to buy a whole new wardrobe to look brand new every year; I don't need to look like "mutton dressed as lamb," as the Victorians said. I'll keep an open mind to new shapes and silhouettes, as another commenter said, and update pieces, but I don't really care if people find my clothes "dated" overall.

text:The second one is a cotton/tencel blend, which will probably make it a bit cooler and lighter (tencel is a kind of viscose). Neither is more premium than the other.

text:What designer bags and eras do you think will come back in fashion 2021-2022?	labels:I don’t know if this trend is in or out, but I expect vivid patterns to be huge this coming year, in line with maximalist clothes being very popular.   Not so much logomania though which worked better IMO with more solid colors, “classic” clothes - jeans, moto jacket, camel coat, turtleneck etc rather than the riot of color, shape, pattern, frills and Victorian romance that is coming forth in clothes.  It won’t be like Betsy Johnson either. No “soft boho frumpy-stylishness” of cloth quilted backpacks or totes or vaguely ethnic casual hobo bags.   I predict it will be structured bags, hard leather, clean defined lines, to reflect our desire for structural things and order and shape in a soft, frumpy, floppy COVID-19 world but with eye catching and stunning prints to celebrate life  Like [this](https://www.fashionphile.com/images/product-images/large/fb59e222975f8f31ffdbdfd28f37f83e/4e070ac3a9eaa58c35cee6a5d68990eb.jpg); [this](https://www.theoutnet.com/en-kw/shop/product/oscar-de-la-renta/top-handle/top-handle-bags/floral-print-leather-shoulder-bag/17476499599661572); [this](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e4/40/05/e4400516af3cee1b37c9853e306aac53.jpg); [this](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/b8/2a/75/b82a75174ba6589eb43c4cb4f8f78fb6.jpg); [this](https://absolutely.london/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/fgh.jpg)

text:Tailoring for the People	labels:Hi folks -- one of my goals for 2021 is to engage more with my menswear hobby. I am engaging more in online communities (Reddit, Blamo slack), writing a blog, and putting together photo albums. I really love tailoring, but like most people, I don't have that many excuses to wear such clothes in my life. So I put together an album of tailoring worn in a very relatable way.   You will see that the photos are very biased towards a couple sources: the Armoury, Brycelands, and Permanent Style. Also, I have used the phrase "tailoring" relatively loosely. Most of the outfits included have at least one tailored item such as trousers, a sport coat, and/or a button down shirt.   Hope y'all like it!

text:How do you think access and privilege affect your taste and sense of style?	labels:I grew up lower middle class. We didn’t have a lot of money but I saved and bought clothes (and music) from the Gap etc (it’s 1994 guys...) at the mall. Not a fancy mall.   I went to college in NYC and started making money (I’m just a teacher but still, no dependents, no car). I meet friends with money who want to go to Bloomingdales and I pop into boutiques on my way to my job in the East Village. Fashion...drool  Ruined forever now. Love me some Uniqlo though  Edit: I didn’t by music at the gap. I bought that at The Wall, just to be clear.	episode_done:True

text:How does your makeup style and clothing style relate? - discussion	labels:Im Op I’ll share mine-  Personally I sort of plan my makeup look based of what I’m wearing   I do mostly dramatic Smokey eyes and cut crease looks with bright blush and lipstick everywhere in colors that either match my outfit or just compliment it well! I also do more eye liner dramatic looks at times as well! Usually if I’m wearing something a bit more cutesy I’ll do my makeup to reflect the look. If Im wearing my black velvet blazer set I’ll do thé likes of and orange and gold Smokey eye to make it more bold and less professional looking! I have a very dressy style with masculine, Victorian, and highly detailed elements so bold colorful makeup makes some of my more stuffy looks less boring. I’ve lately been after doing my foundation putting a bit of blush from the bottom front of my eye bags to the top of my brow bone. I love how it makes makeup a little more unique and makes me look a little less baby faced.  I used to wear very skater boyish/ art kid outfits and hair ( I still respect the style still though ) but wore heavy Instagram glam style makeup. I still do glam makeup but it looked quite odd at times! I didn’t really think much about makeup in relation to clothing then, not that it’s really necessary! I feel I’ve come far with my style!

text:Can we discuss how uncomfortable it can be to dress fashionably sometimes? Must beauty = pain? Looking for comfort tips!	labels:I can't do uncomfortable anymore. Just won't. I would try to figure out what you like in a look and then work on how to have the look in comfort. For example, I like the height of heels but don't want my foot at a steep angle all day. For me clog type shoes and shooties have been an answer. Brands that work with your shape help, too. Curvy pants for me work better even after significant weight loss because they better mirror my shape. Considering fabrics helps, too. Sometimes a knit can be more forgiving than a weave. Sleeves that aren't long enough and  cause tightness across the back of a blouse are one of my pet peeves. To be avoided at all cost.   Be prepared to return things if you order on line and they don't live up to your standards for comfort. Assume you can do it and you will do it. I am like 100 (60...) and I own my look finally. Sh$%canning uncomfortable things has been a significant part of that.
text:You know what....I may just need curvy pants!!!! Oh my god this may be it, because even if I have the “correct” size it just hits my waist and hips wrong....

text:Changing your mindset from fast fashion to one of investment pieces. What did you learn?	labels:Hey – so I am in a similar position. I'm 21, soon applying to law school, trying to mature myself as I become an adult and search for internships. I'm just in general going through the adult transition. And, well, as you said: it can be hard to justify those hefty purchases; I just spent well over $1000 on items that will upgrade my wardrobe. But it is just that – an *investment* – and you will have much more confidence wearing clothes that fit better, last longer, and please you more. You can price the clothes but not the sense of a new you that comes with it, and in that, to me, lies the value.   Furthermore, you can always search on Depop, eBay, Mercari, Poshmark, etc. for pre-loved pieces that are still in great condition and save quite a bit.	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 02, 2021	labels:Wedding Question, looking for some rules of thumb or other tips.   I'm currently picking out colors for myself and groomsmen which will affect what the bridesmaids can wear. I'm considering a green color no unlike [this](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/26/f7/ac/26f7ac2ea0467095b5fc7e1af783b33c.jpg) because I want to wear something a little different but I'm receiving some pushback. My suit would be MTO and my groomsmen would likely wear grey rentals.   * Is the above a bad idea in any way? How could I improve it? * Should bridesmaids wear complementary colors (next to green on color wheel) or contrasting colors (opposite on the color wheel)? Some suggested maroon bridesmaids.  * Should I attempt to match the groomsmen somewhat by wearing a grey vest with green? * Does palette matter as much as principal color? For example, if bridesmaids wear blue to complement my green, it that good enough or I should I be concerned with a forest green clashing with, say, pastel blues? * My partner and one bridesmaid has suggested my groomsmen not wearing jackets at all or just wearing vests. Please for all that is good confirm for me that this is a terrible idea. It goes against everything I've ever read on MFA, 'tie and no jacket looks like used-car salesman,' 'suspenders without jacket looks goofy,' 'vests without a jacket makes you look like a waiter'...
text:Green isn't a bad idea the issue is it'll be a one off suit that you won't wear as often as say a navy or grey suit. If your fine with that go for it  As far as brides maids colors I would work your wife and see what she thinks whether the color is complimentary or contrasting doesn't matter as much as making sure it looks good. Maroon age that green with the groomsmen in grey is a great color scheme for a wedding.  If you wanna match your groomsmen go for it that being said being completely different works just as well  it's personal preference. (I say go completely different it's yours and your partners day)  Edit : with palette once again different palletes like you mention sky blue would totally work with your dark green.  Also yes please push back on Vests only for groomsmen if they wanna take off their jackets at the reception totally fine but for the ceremony jackets are gonna be best (especially if your wearing a jacket)	labels:I absolutely agree with your first point. I already have a light-ish navy blue suit that I love and grey was too boring for me for a wedding suit so I am aware and absolutely okay with this. I will also as the company to send swatches if possible to make sure I choose the correct green.   Thanks for confirming the other ideas. I tend to agree the maroon should look pretty good but I'm feeling more comfortable about it now. I won't get too caught up in distinct palettes a long as the general color combinations are correct.	episode_done:True

text:How much was your most expensive fashion item and when or how often do you wear it?	labels:My Allsaints leather jacket for $380 because I’m an FFA cliche lmao. I don’t actually wear it that often because I live in a place that’s usually intensely cold or just, warm-ish in the fall/spring so most of my transitional jackets don’t get much use. I did wear it a lot this fall though since I discovered that combining with a giant cashmere scarf made it okay to wear down to 30 degrees for dog walks. Trying to keep it pristine-looking was a lost cause from the start because my dog has jumped all over it and I think I’ve managed to put some other scratches in it. I take care of it by hanging it up and using leather conditioner but I’m gonna wear the hell out of it.   I think having an expensive white blouse that can only be dry cleaned is much more nerve-wracking piece of clothing to wear than like, black designer jeans that are already distressed, you know? Especially if you don’t already have experience owning other white shirts or something like that. If you want the most bang for your buck, I’d get something that’s a more elevated version of something you already love to wear often, and bonus if you don’t have to wash it after every wear (because you’ll be able to wear it more AND it’ll last longer).	episode_done:True

text:What would you wear to elope during a pandemic?	labels:Hah, I actually DID elope during the pandemic a few months ago! I had a ceremony on my front porch with just my husband and the officiant.  I planned ahead and ordered this amazing dress from [Wish](https://www.wish.com/product/5d8ad46a761eea3e14f5d5a4?share=web), and even at the time I got it on sale for 15 bucks. It was supposed to take a few months to arrive, but Wish is pretty unpredictable, and it actually arrived in about one. It fit me almost perfectly, which really surprised me. If you aren't strict on having to get married in exactly in a month, then Wish is a fantastic option. There are so many different styles, colors, qualities, and price ranges to pick from. My aunt also got her wedding dress from Wish, and loved it.  I went to a craft store and got some fake flowers and made a flower crown to wear instead of a veil.  I mainly focused on vines and succulents on mine so I could match the vine theme on the dress. It was simple, quick, and cheap to do, but added a unique flair to the outfit. There are tutorials online, but you could always order a premade one from Amazon as well.  As for my shoes, I just wore my trusty pair of black flats. I actually have personal reasons for wanting to wear specifically those, but they were completely hidden by my dress. So eh.  My biggest advice is to just wear what makes you happy. The day of my wedding, my family (from an 8 hour distance), tried to pressure me into getting my hair and makeup professionally done, to wear high heels, to wear a more revealing dress. I didn't listen to them, and I'm really glad. I simply wore my hair down, did basic nude makeup, and wore what made me comfortable. In the end, my wedding pictures turned out beautiful and true to both me and my husbands character.  ALSO CONGRATS!!	episode_done:True

text:How many clothes do you have? (Really?)	labels:I'm in my early 30s, midwest of the US, single and childless. I have roughly been the same weight since high school (and when it does fluctuate, seems to gain evenly, because I can go up like 15 lbs before I start to notice with clothes and eveb more before I have trouble buttoning things) and the same height since 4th grade.   I probably have at least a thousand pieces of clothing, and that's with a pretty regular in/out system, and this number includes at least one pretty major (now regretted) purge like six or seven years ago. But still, I have stuff from the late 90s I still wear! I shop at second hand stores and boutiques and the mall. I am pretty equal opportunity when it comes to where my clothes come from!   I have trouble wearing the exact same outfit more than once. Even if I make the clothes the same, I'll mix up shoes or other accessories. It's not *why* I have so much stuff (I don't think) but it just feels weird to me to wear the same combination when there are probably billions of choices from my closet (trillions? Millions? I don't know math. But like, a lot, haha)

As someone  whose budget is not even close to that (I've always bought 40$ pants, 70-80$ shoes and max 100$ jackets) knowing this it's quite depressing
text:For many people on this sub fashion is a hobby, and so they don't mind spending a bit more on quality items. Some materials (e.g. wool/ leather) are just more expensive.  There's also the question of quality. A 500€ leather jacket may be usable for 20 years, while a 100€ one will deteriorate after 2.   The reality is though, people on this sub rarely pay full price for their items. Many buy during store discounts or second hand. Buying second hand is a great way to get quality clothing for little money! Find some brands that you like and then go look for them used.  Many people (me definitely included) are working with a small budget, it's definitely possible!	labels:	episode_done:True

text:How do you style your existing wardrobe in a way that doesn’t get boring?	labels:Your default look sounds super neutral. Figure out what or where you'd be happy to add visual interest to/with.   1. build a wardrobe of interesting belts 2. stop getting plain shoes and get statement shoes 3. switch up your tops with something with pattern or interesting texture 4. add a third piece: jacket, vest, scarf, necklace, statement earrings  I generally need to have a patten or a loud color in outfits to feel like myself. And sometimes both. I also like to make sure there is one interesting or attention grabbing thing. That be an element of the outfit or the jewelry.  For example, my go to look used to be plain bottoms, patterned top, cardigan or a patterned dress.  At some point I got sick of it. I still love my patterned dresses, but I am trying to mix in more solid ones so they will be a good showcase for an interesting necklace. I decided to look for more statement bottoms, and pair them with plain tops.   Cardigans got old for me, so I needed to find a new type of topper. I landed on blazers and bombers.   I do not really like super statement shoes - mine are generally neutral in pretty standard shapes. Occasionally I'll get a more colorful shoe or a teexture/print like snake. But I can't get one with a super wild heel shape, that is too much for me since I like other things to be loud in my outfit. I am also the same about my purses, they tend to be fairly basic - save a bit of texture or hardware.  I also tend to wear jewelry that is not colorful, since my clothes generally are. Mostly metal jewelry for me.   My current fashion goal is to feel more like myself in solids. Just because it can be hard to rewear all my patterned items all the time, so I need to mix in a few "blander" items more regularly. But I can't do an outfit of all plain solids. It is too much for me. For example, yesterday I put on a black jumpsuit with wide legs and a split hem, and a chunky cropped neon pink cardigan, and black and white snake lace-up booties. 2 solids - not too boring. Patterned shoes. In my box by incorporating pattern and bright color.   **TLDR: Figure out where in your outfit do you want to make a statement: accessories, jewelry, shoes, one piece of clothing can all be your statement item. And make sure every outfit has at least one. If you are more maximal, you might have 2+ statement items in every outfit.**
text:Great suggestions! I have a decent shoe collection, but while the styles vary, the colors are all the same—I buy tan/beige or black shoes almost exclusively because I know I can wear them with just about anything. But you’re totally right, a fun print or bold color would add interest to an otherwise “safe”  look—especially because I wear mostly earth tones and neutrals.	labels:	episode_done:True

I would like to downsize eventually but I actually prefer to hold on the clothes I don’t wear that often, because I’d rather have a box of clothes in my spare room closet that I can dig through to find something “new” to wear, rather than decluttering what I don’t really wear and then shopping for something similar down the line. I have decluttered clothes in the past that I know now I would have worn again if I had just had a break from it for a little while.

text:What do you carry in your handbag?	labels:Discussions about bags AND what's in them? Two of my favorite things mashed together.   My basic items include my phone, keys, card-holder, hand sanitizer, two pairs of reusable masks (in a zipped pouch), and those wired apple earbuds from 2016 before they got rid of the jack.  My big bag is the Bottega Veneta Arco in 56 cm. I use this primarily for work because I need to carry my own personal laptop, work laptop, my planner, my full makeup bag, a spare change of clothing, a water bottle, Bose noise-cancelling headphones, gloves, large hand sanitizer + wipes, my charging cables bag (all my laptop and phone chargers), and probably a spare change of shoes, too. It's a lot. Sometimes, I even use this as my "wine" bag when I go to the liquor store because it can fit 3 bottles lmao  My medium bag used to be my go-to bag before the pandemic. It was the Madewell Medium Leather Transport Tote (zip-closure). I used to carry a slim water-bottle (like those baby ones), my planner, all my basic items, and one of those foldable shopping bags in case I bought something while out. I hate collecting either paper or plastic shopping bags, so I tend to always carry one of those foldable totes inside an inner pocket.  Now, my old Fjallraven Kanken is my everyday bag. It used to be my old school bag, so I don't really care about scuffing it up or throwing it around, especially in covid-times, and the outer coating means I can spray it with Lysol when I come home and not have to worry about destroying the textiles. Depending on the day, it'll carry my basics, my personal laptop if I go to an outdoor park and write, a water bottle, a flask, and my vape.  Everybody has different needs, so if you're less high-maintenance like I am, then I would definitely recommend a tried-and-true tote like the Goyard Artois or the LV Neverfull. They're classics, but if you're looking for something bigger (or smaller), then I can't recommend my BV Arco enough. It also comes in 33 cm and 48 cm, I think. If you are into basics-only-with-some-wiggle-room bags, my friend loves her Balenciaga City Bag and her Proenza Schouler PS1.  This was longer than I anticipated. Hope this helps!

text:Does anyone else feel that nothing is unfashionable nowadays?	labels:The present always feels “neutral”. I think if you watch any reality show from the early 2010s, even as late as 2014-15, you’ll see a big difference from what was considered “no defining silhouette” then. things like just a tshirt change slightly in cut and shape over time.
text:Yeah, exactly. Like I would say the most fashionable t-shirt cut a few years ago was a v-neck with capped sleeves. Before that, a very long v-neck with longer fitted sleeves (think American Apparel). Now I would speculate that it's either a fitted cropped crew-neck or an over-sized unisex t-shirt. I'm not saying people only wear those types of ts at those times, but that's what is and was most current.     I do think that trends are changing more quickly and thus fewer people can (or bother to) keep up so wearing the exactly what's in vogue right this second is less important than it used to be.     I also think that younger people tend to prioritize being on trend more. Teens in particular are usually still growing so they need new clothes more often anyway. As you get older and spend more time around other older people, your definition of "current" changes. More formal clothing tends to be more timeless too, so once you're wearing work wear 5 days a week the definition of "current" seems to shift.	labels:Ughhh I hate that it’s becoming more and more difficult to find v-necks and scoop necks sometimes.

text:People with an over the top personal style, how do you incorporate it into your day to day?	labels:Some people have mentioned getting basic items and going from there but depending on the look, your basics actually can be mildly or very unusual pieces.

I'm also doing similar with blouses, seeking elements that appear in my style. My jeans are all flares or wide leg, occasionally patterned too. My basic jewellery items all have a little something extra (my basic silver hoops have moths on, my brass coin necklace is oval and has interesting symbols on).  I do wear my fair share of graphic tees (a number are from etsy with interesting illustrations on or fan made band tees) and they slide into the wardrobe well with some flares and a patterned or leather blazer.

text:General Discussion - November 29, 2020	labels:Just finished Legend of Korra and it was really good. The first season was good, the second was meh, but seasons 3 and 4 were fantastic. I went into it super skeptical but I think it was a worthy successor to Avatar, although I don't think anything can top that show (it was the only TV series I followed as a kid and I've rewatched it a ton since).
text:I liked it and I think the art style and music match the pace well, however, my only two problems were:  * not nearly as relaxing and soothing as Avatar. Avatar has really nice nature connections that are kinda lost in the city setting The filler episodes in Avatar are relaxing and nice looks into either the nature of bending/human-nature relationships or the friendships/personalities of the characters.   * Korra never learns anything. Aang learned how to solve problems without using his powers and Korra just hits stuff until it’s fixed. Aang had to grapple with his moral code constantly. Korra just gets the major issue of the end of the first season solved for her with out doing anything. It seemed like an interesting dilemma for her character and she gets out of it with out changing at all or even a hint of self reflection. Plus her villains are all way more interesting and actually have some nuance and personality.	labels:Yeah, I do think that they really missed out on developing most of the characters. Very few of them had an arc similar to Zuko, Sokka, or Katara. They went with more characters with less development, which is just a different approach IMO. I do think she really doesn't show much growth in S1 and S2, which is one of my main complaints. She consistently loses in fights and never really seems to change anything. I also could have used like 100X more meetings with Aang, I think Aang had more time with Roku than Korra had with Aang.	episode_done:True

text:What are a few items that you feel are essential when planning a wardrobe?	labels:I really think a palette is essential. Even if you are someone that isn’t into neutrals, a basic understanding of color theory will really make all your outfits “work.”   Examples of palettes [1](https://blog.colettehq.com/wardrobe-architect/week-10-the-capsule-palette) and [2](http://www.katberries.com/2014/09/step-4-colour-palette-capsule-wardrobe.html?m=1)  A basic example of a [paletted set of clothes](https://pin.it/33ISMWb)  I’m not saying you should limit yourself - but if you’re just starting out, I would go to your current closet and figure out which colors you like best on you, and figure out a palette that incorporates those colors and suggests a few more.  When I started this process, I knew I liked ivory, black and a rich golden color (what one of the palettes calls “Whiskey.” By looking at palettes, I added more clothes in navy, grey, blush pink and forest green.  What if you’re a colorful, nonboring person? Color theory works well here too. This is a great guide from building your color comfort from [100% neutral all the way to fantastical 70s bold](https://www.nicolesalgado.com/guide-how-to-match-colors-and-clothes/) by working with complimentary colors, secondary, triadic, analogous colors etc.  (Note that color is only one element of your wardrobe but the easiest, most apparent one - people also add interest and variety by mixing and matching patterns; textures and materials (silk, denim, leather, lace, linen, beading etc.); and silhouettes and shapes, but that’s all a bit more complicated to explain but may also come more naturally with experience.)  As for specific items, a basic girl like me would say I consider following to be essential to my wardrobe:  - Three tops: white tee, black tank, a simple patterned blouse (french stripes, cream and black polkadots etc.)  - Three bottoms: medium blue jeans; sand/tan colored chino pants; black tights  - Three types of shoes: Black heels; white sneakers; brown booties  - One neutral coat in some base color like Navy, Camel, Charcoal  - One brown bag, one black bag  - A gold pendant necklace  - A “bold bright red lipstick” and a more natural muted lip taint/gloss in rose, berry etc.

text:Changing your mindset from fast fashion to one of investment pieces. What did you learn?	labels:I've learned that when it comes to pants, I have an easier time finding skinny jeans/trousers/etc. if I'm buying fast fashion rather than designer or luxury.   As a fairly short guy, if I want something very tight/sleek (I'm talking about that spray-on level of tightness lol) that looks good with heeled boots, I have no choice to but to get fast fashion if I want something that I can actually fit into. This is because fast-fashion stuff tends to have more synthetics that are stretchy, and also have a wider range of sizing options. If I'm getting something more designer, I've found that it's hard to find something that isn't 95% cotton with almost no stretch.  If I'm not looking for something that looks like it's been sprayed-on, I've found that Rosen/Yohji/anything similar scratches a certain itch. I have pants from Rosen that fit me well at my pre-covid bodyweight. These look good with almost anything ranging from Chucks, to Tabis. I've since lost over 25 pounds, but these pants still fit comfortably.  Rosen also produces garments with technical fabrics that solve a lot of fit problems by virtue of being super-stretchy.  Buying fast fashion isn't a waste of time or money though, it's a great way to zero in on exactly the look you want for relatively cheap. Then you can figure out an equivalent higher-end option for the one or two pieces that you wear the most.	episode_done:True
text:Top of WAYWT - November 2020	labels:I don’t understand the whole thing with pants that are way too short.
text:I half get it - some of these work and some of these look straight goofy. In my opinion the goofiness comes from short guys trying to pull off crop pants that are also wide legged. The proportions are just way too jarring. With a tall guy it’s like “I’m wearing normal clothes but I’m so tall that these pants are short.”  But with short guy proportions it’s like “I’m wearing long baggy shorts.”  In my opinion you can still do cropped and baggy pants if you’re short, just choose a tapered leg.

text:If you had $5,000 to What-Not-To-Wear style re-do your whole wardrobe, how would you do it? What would be your process?

I don't really need a winter coat or any other big thing where I live so I think putting another $1,000 into shoes (1 pair of nice shoes + a few cheaper ones for other occasions) and $1,500 into clothing (basics and work-appropriate clothing) would work out for me. You can get a good number of clothes at a decent quality at that amount IMO.  I work in finance and I feel like having a good bag and pair of shoes really ties in your outfit even if the rest of it is relatively cheap.	episode_done:True

For example, this [3sixteen tee](https://www.3sixteen.com/collections/tees/products/heavyweight-plain-t-shirt-white-2-pack) is 225gsm which is very substantial.

text:Underwear review: Soma vs. Parade after 6 months	labels:If anyone is looking for cotton underwear, I recently purchased a few pairs from [Knickey](https://knickey.com) and [ARQ](https://shoparq.com). I’m officially an old (in my early 30s) and was looking for comfortable cotton underwear to wear bed or under dresses. I prefer high rise underwear because I have a long torso and wear mostly high waisted pants. I still wear thongs (mostly Hanky Panky retro thong) with tight fitting bottoms.   Knickey is more “affordable” at $13 a pair. I purchased the mid rise and high rise briefs. I was surprised that the mid rise was about as high as other brands high rise (Aerie for example). High rise hits right below my belly button. Thinner cotton compared to ARQ, but very comfortable for me. I have a larger butt but I haven’t has issues with wedgies (an issue I’ve had with other brands). Putting them through the dryer did shrink them a little (I tested one pair first because I know I’m lazy and will eventually throw them in the dryer). Overall they feel way better than the mall brands I’ve tried the past few years.   ARQ is definitely more expensive at $28 a pair. They also only offer one style (high rise brief). The style is more “retro” and definitely high rise. They actually go above my belly button. The fabric is thick and the stitching is really impressive. Very comfortable, no wedgies. I have been machine drying them with no issues.  I love the single pair I purchased.   I am actually really happy with both purchases. ARQ is too expensive for me to fill my underwear drawer with, but I may get a second pair soon.  Oh, I did buy [The Reformation](https://www.thereformation.com) mid rise thong to test out. It’s not cotton, but I was curious. It’s ok. Not high enough rise for my taste, but comfortable. I wouldn’t repurchase though.

Cheaper sweaters are noticeably thinner (both the threads and the sweater itself), which don't keep you as warm and don't last as long.   The good news is that there are some great options for getting high quality sweaters at low prices if you're willing to shop secondhand. For $150 you can find a gently used sweaters from Ines Meain and IMO that's a much better purchase than most of the cotton and fine merino wool sweaters listed in this article.

Gloves are a must for me, I can't leave the house without them in the winter. Unfortunately I've lost a few gloves here and there so i have a few singles. Hats feel more decorative. I've had times when my ears got so cold with the wind that they hurt so a coat with a hood is great. I also second the comment saying the jacket should be long.

text:What's your fashion tragedy?	labels:Not mine, but my boyfriend’s that I caused. I ride horses and compete, so I have a couple of show jackets that look basically like blazers. Fortunately in the last few years, basically every company makes show jackets in a stretchy, washable material that is way cooler and more comfortable. If I’m sweating for two hours on a horse I want to wash what I’m wearing as soon as I can and not wait to take it to a dry cleaner, right? So I got home from riding and threw all my stuff in the basket and started getting a load of laundry ready. I saw my jacket on the back of a chair and grabbed it, threw everything in the wash on a heavy cycle so it’s really clean and fresh. Some time later my boyfriend asked where his blazer was. I was like blazer? What blazer? He said “you know, my navy blazer. My favorite one. I left it out.” Oh no. Sure enough, I had washed his nice suit blazer, his favorite, that looked great on him and fit perfectly. He still gives me shit about it and I still have the blazer in my closet, hoping there’s some way to save it.

text:General Discussion - January 19, 2021	labels:Well, I've been keeping strict quarantine ever since March 24. I only leave home for work and that's it. Every month or so I meet up with some friends while keeping the safety guidelines: we meet up in open spaces, always keep our masks on, keep safe distance, etc. But other than that I'm home stuck; I haven't set foot in a restaurant, café, mall, movie theater or whatever in almost a year. Some may think this a bit too extreme, and it may be, but I live with family members that may be more susceptible to COVID so we can't take any risks.  Before the pandemic one of my favorite things to do was grab a book, hop into my car and drive aimlessly to see where I ended up. I normally settled down in a café to read or I stopped by a bite someplace I hadn't been before.   I'm a homebody but even I have my limits, so as of late I've been wanting to leave the house and once again wonder around. Maybe I'll do it this weekend. This time around I'll avoid indoor places and just stick to open places, like parks. I'm planning to follow the safety guidelines and everything, but I still can't help but feel selfish. What if unknowingly I'll expose my family to COVID? One part of me feels like I'm overreacting, I mean, everybody I know is going on with their lives and they seem fine. But I can't seem to shake off this latent fear. Maybe the pandemic has affected me in ways that I'm just starting to notice.
text:I’ve been living a similar life. If you are outside with space it’s probably fine, especially with masks. Don’t know your area but in mine, people have been respectful of mask etiquette even in really open parks and trails. If there are any state parks or forests near you, I highly recommend trying to get there on a weekday, preferably with slightly crumby weather, to avoid the crowds  The best thing about the woods is you don’t need to stay on the path if you see someone coming and want to give them a wide berth	labels:Where I live it's currently dark outside of working hours. Fortunately I work from home and there's very little oversight outside of meetings, so every other day I've been running in the park near my place. At first I felt bad about taking time out of work but I feel much more productive now than I was when I was stuck inside 24/7 with no reason to go out. I'd probably have spent that hour at home goofing off on Reddit anyway.	episode_done:True

I dress on the more casual side, if that matters.

I usually wear slim fit XL t-shirts which aren't snug but not loose, I *feel* these are a tad bit too loose? The arms look so baggy, there isn't a taper, hem is too long; the shoulder fit is just perfect and how I like it which is what I go by for finding my size. I'm new to this lol.   Thanks!
text:You could certainly size down and that would also look good, but also find this more rumpled baggie look solid as well, different fits for different approaches.  The hem on a lot of those wrangler shirts is longer because it’s meant to be tucked in while working/riding. And the fit will be a boxy classic American fit.	labels:Gotcha, thanks! I'd be okay with keeping this I like the ruffled look a bit but I just wanted to make sure I didn't look like I was wearing my older brother's clothing or what not haha. I wear slimmer jeans in general so maybe it's harmonious.	episode_done:True

text:Post-Baby Problems I Wish Someone Had Warned Me About	labels:To add in:   - One of my arches fell - goodbye cute flats, hello orthotics.   - Pregnancy and nursing sometimes causes carpal tunnel. Nothing says “fashion” like wrist braces.  - Changed shape in unexpected ways, like my shoulders got broader. Which means things pulled in new weird ways, which...   - Made existing back issues worse, and limited even more of the pre-baby clothes i was able to tolerate. Anything that buttoned at the wrist? Nope! Anything that was tight around the rib cage? Niet! I’d be laid up for days and also dear god could i not afford to be laid up for days, because working mom.   - Not all moms lose weight while nursing, some of us continue to pack it on like dairy cows. By the time i had a baby, finished nursing, my hormones evened out and I was back to my pre-pregnancy weight, fashion had moved on without me. So even wearing my pre-baby clothes sometimes made me look a bit dated. I ended up overhauling my closet both times no matter being the same size in the end.
text:Adding on to the carpal tunnel point, repetitively picking up your newborn can lead to De Quervains tendinitis (which is like carpal tunnel but in your thumb instead of the middle of the wrist). Look after your tendons ladies!	labels:5 months preg and I’ve already started to develop De Quervains in my left hand from knitting.

text:"freeing the titty" when you don't have "fashion boobs"?	labels:During pride in San Francisco you can see plenty of topless women and full frontal penis. People of all shapes and sizes are on display. I imagine if public nudity was allowed and became a fashion trend, it’d be a risky personal choice given the prevalence of cell phones and social media. You would either be praised for being super hot or ridiculed for daring to show us your bits. Also I imagine a lot of people in political positions, celebrities, etc. would really create a show out of it. Kim Kardashian would probably be naked all the time
text:Public toplessness is legal in more places than you might realize. But the stigma and the presence of camera phones makes it discouraging to Americans, at least. When I went to Europe for field school I saw a lot of women go to the beach topless, and I wanted to do that too. But I overheard some of the other students acting all surprised about the toplessness (which like, guys, you're in Europe! Did you really not know about this beforehand?!) and I was afraid that one of the students would come to the beach the same time as me and make a big deal about it. So I only did a topless swim for a few minutes.  If it was just me on a trip by myself I wouldn't have cared because, hey, it's mostly locals (or at least other European tourists) here. But with all of those non-Europeans that I personally met in the area, I was too nervous to go more than a few minutes.	labels:Yeah I can’t imagine locking eyes with a coworker or my boss if I was topless. I can see younger people indulging in it, but younger people are even crueler when it comes to judging bodies. I imagine you’d only see the popular kids posing it up on Instagram	episode_done:True
text:Dress Sneakers Are Alarmingly Popular	labels:Idc if you guys downvote me, but in a business casual environment, dress sneakers are amazing.  Granted I would never wear this with a suit, but I do not think there is anything wrong with rocking these with chinos and a button down.  You can even add a blazer if you need to be a bit more formal.
text:I snagged some Italian made pair a few years ago for a significant amount off the actual retail (lol per this thread I guess because they're "dress sneakers"), I don't recall the brand name off hand and since I haven't gone into the office ever again I don't really wear them anymore, but the leather feels so super comfortable and nice. They're tan with the per this thread, hated white sole. But it's a normal sneaker sole not that chunky one people keep posting.  \*shrug* I like them and they pair well with some outfits. Not as versatile as a regular sneaker, but nice to have a different flavor when you want something different.	labels:IMO for casual scenarios they are fine, it is that damn white sole with a suit which give them casual vibes	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 16, 2020	labels:Anyone have any recent experience with Allen Edmonds?

I've been thinking of picking up one more pair of dress shoes in chilli ( I have walnut and black) with the hopes I never need to buy dress shoes again.   Which reminds me of a thought i've been having, do you think suits and professional wear are gonna be dead post pandemic? Cuz I have good charcoal suit and one crappy navy suit that I'm looking to replace with something a bit better to last me for at least several years but I wonder if there is even a point post pandemic if we never really wear suits again.
text:Regardless of the howling of shoe nerds decrying the downhill slide of AE, they are still a fine choice especially with the significant sales they now seemingly constantly run.  I would hold off on a suit purchase for now and reassess the landscape post-COVID.	labels:Oh ok that’s great to hear. Yeah I’ve been seeing a lot of posts attack AE and I noticed my second pair of shoes is not the same quality as the first one. Was curious how steep the decline has been since then.  And ah fair enough. My shoe choice was going to slightly depend on a new suit as the chili colored shoes go best with navy and Id want a nice navy suit to go with it. But you make a good point. I’ll probably hold off. Thanks.	episode_done:True

text:Naked and Famous Raw Denim Review/Fit/Experience	labels:I’m a personal stylist who focuses JUST on women’s jeans and in all my years of experience I’ve only put raw denim on 2 of my clients for this exact reason. It’s too difficult to really nail the fit.... and if you do, there’s a good chance it’ll change as the jeans settle out or if your body changes. Plus, cutting around curves is super tough.   Raw denim is awesome in theory. It ages with you and confirms to your body. And the look of it over time is so cool. But I’ve almost never seen it work with women, especially in skinnier cuts. There’s just no give.   I would otherwise recommend vintage Levi’s or 100% cotton premium denim in a heartier weight for a more structured jean. The difference it that it’s been rinsed/washed so the fit is more predictable and longer lasting than raw denim.

text:Alterations don't have any influence on the price of a garment on the used market (except if the result is that the alteration makes it harder to fit for most people, which will depress the value). Nobody buying cares what you paid for alterations; they just want value for their purchase.  I would look at sold listings on eBay and other resale sites and price around there/maybe a little higher (to account for offers). If you can't find any sold listings then try pricing it at or near the retail price and lowering the price until you get interest.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:(UPDATE) Ladies who miss fashion/makeup/getting dressed up... how are you doing?	labels:I’m about 50/50 on whether I dress for the day but I usually feel better and am more productive when I do because staying in pajamas doesn’t put me in a working mindset. I’m busy right now so I have felt pressured not to take time for makeup when I’ll just be washing it off in a couple hours but I miss the fun of it.  I cleaned the bottoms of my shoes and wear them at my desk because they’re my favorite part of most outfits but I still miss going places.	episode_done:True
text:How has the quality changed over the years at some of your fav brands?	labels:Brandy Melville.  I used to STAN brandy but somewhere in the past couple of years the quality just DIPPED. The materials aren’t soft and lush. Everything feels uncomfortable and looks cheap. Maybe it’s because the price hasn’t changed much?
text:> Everything feels uncomfortable and looks cheap. Maybe it’s because the price hasn’t changed much?  I think this is the root cause of the quality issue for many, many brands.  They find that their core consumer expects certain pricing (and sales online, etc.) so they've just cut quality to keep the price.  I see people complaining(!) about the price of $35 jeans. Jeans were $35 when I was in high school in 1988 and made $3.35 an hour.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:How would you describe the quality of self-knit/self-made clothes vs. store bought?	labels:Yes, for sewing. I have no idea about knitting. I'm not sure why people are saying not for knits - I use a serger and a coverstitch machine to get a professional finish.   As someone else said, wearing clothing custom made to your measurements feels amazing.   I also like that I know exactly the conditions in which my clothes were made, since I'm the person who made them.   One thing I struggle with is finding top quality fabric, especially knits. I think it's due to 1) price exceeds my budget 2) I'm ordering online and don't have access to a fabric district 3) maybe nice knits just aren't available to home sewists? I'm not sure, I'm still looking. I think I finally found a source for rayon/spandex tee shirt fabric.

I've been trying to figure out a wardrobe for these issues for YEARS. especially since I'm nonbinary and leggings aren't usually appropriate for my work place anyway.   I buy a lot of 'guys' clothes, honestly. The fabric is thicker so I dont have claustraphobic layers. I usually go for crew neck sweaters since hoodies tend to make me feel like something is pressing on my throat, due to the weight of the hood. Soft cargo pants are MY BEST FRIEND. if they aren't too baggy, they can honestly go with anything. My uniform is cargo pants, sneakers/work boots, soft sports bra, and a soft t-shirt. Sometimes I wear converse but they tend to give me blisters so I usually stick to sneakers.   The things I avoid like the plague are: skinny jeans, sheer fabric, layers, windbreakers, zip up hoodies, cheekster underwear, and bras with wires.   Flannels are good if you need something over a t shirt but might need to remove it later if it gets warm, the fabric is usually thick but soft. I shop 90% thrift and don't usually pay attention to brands, or id be able to recommend some! The only things I buy new would be sports bras and Stafford brand, classic fit heavyweight t shirts. They're soft, stretchy, and can be form fitting but not claustraphobic if you go down a size. I love them, have like 5 by now. Also pretty inexpensive as far as shirts go!	episode_done:True

text:Article: Why Is Fashion So Beige This Season?	labels:The last time I remember noticing beige getting popular was around 2009 (the great recession). I was going to fashion school at the time and one of my profs noted that neutrals tend to come in style when the economy tanks because the pieces are more versatile. Like, there's only so many ways you can wear a bright pink top, but you can generally wear neutrals with everything.  Anyhow, I've noticed color palettes are trending more neutral again and I took it as a sign that fashion folks are taking into account that during the pandemic customers are trying to stretch their buys as far as possible.  Tbh, I don't feel strongly about it except that what I think it signifies makes me sad. I think it's triggering some minor trauma from my early adulthood and the recession 🤣
text:> beige getting popular was around 2009 (the great recession)  I would also add that life just...isn't fun right now. Just like in 2009, people are anxious and unhappy. People have lost their jobs even their homes. On top of that, we have an insanely fractured political environment and have been deprived of our basic need to be social & around other humans. This just isn't yellow sundress with sandals vibes. I hope, hope, hope summer 2021 is different.	labels:Ugh... I'm super, super lucky to be in an okay place financially during these times, but I haven't done any shopping at all since the pandemic hit because I never leave the house. I now wear sweatpants 90% of the time. I bought a super cute summer dress just before everything shut down, and I still haven't had a chance to wear it 😭 (First world problems, I know...)	episode_done:True
text:Women with ADHD & Sensory Processing Disorder: I need Clothing recs!	labels:Ok so I don’t think I have sensory processing disorder but I HATE the feeling of denim. I never wore jeans even when I was a kid bc it’s so freaking uncomfortable and dense feeling. I usually wear skirts that fall between mid thigh and just below the knee, but I also wear cigarette pants, which look semi formal but are actually really comfy and don’t feel like jeans at all. I don’t have the brand names of any but I ordered some from Calvin Klein for about $30 (they were on sale) and they’re getting here on Sunday. I can update then, if it helps, and let you know if they’re comfy to me.   I also rip the back tags off of every clothing item because they’re so itchy, so idk the brands that I usually buy, sorry. I usually wear mock necks instead of turtlenecks, bc they look pretty similar. When I do get turtlenecks I usually buy a size up and then stretch out the neck if I really need to.   Also I am so sorry about the body dysmorphia. So many women deal with that shit, and it is fucking terrible.
text:Do you have a rec for cigarette pants? I generally feel the same way as you about denim (despite wearing jeans 99% of the time pre-covid), but I prefer pants to skirts because I like putting forth a slightly more masculine energy.  (edit: derp I saw you say you didn't have brand names. If you can update later though as you offered that would be swell!)	labels:Hi! Just got the Calvin Klein cigarette pants (they cost less than $30 when I ordered them, still might bc of Black Friday) They are *very* comfy. Slightly less cozy than pajamas, but way better than denim in texture. They’re pretty stretchy, and fit true to size. Im also pretty tall, and they stop at just above the ankle, which is where I wanted them to, so that’s great as well!

text:How do you shop at TJ Maxx/Marshall’s?	labels:Find out when the deliveries are. Then try to go that evening or the next morning
text:I'd recommend the following day.  They staff in a morning and evening shift, usually.  The evening shift spends their time ringing customers and cleaning/straightening the store sections.  The morning staff come in to a clean area and usually the shift that deals with moving out new inventory putting old items on clearance.    I worked at one for about a year.	labels:I also worked at one of these stores, and we actually had a dedicated overnight stocking team. I was a customer service rep and just worked the register/fitting rooms with bouts of recovery (that's retail-speak for "picking up" for those who haven't had the absolute hellacious experience of working retail). Never stocked anything. So I think it probably depends on the location. My store was pretty high-volume, a "flagship" store in an area where we got huge influxes of tourists looking for "nice things" cheap.	episode_done:True

text:Surfing Boden is my passion 😍	labels:They have the best brochures and ads! I still look through new arrivals all the time even though I’m committed to not buying non-necessities this year	episode_done:True
text:Jeans: Recommendations and Reviews	labels:After trying several premium brands, I have settled on AGOLDE as my favorite ($168). It is about $50-70 cheaper than Citizens of Humanity, AG Jeans, ParkerSmith, Mother (all ~$200-220) and their 98% cotton is both comfortably stretchy and thick enough to feel substantial. The AGOLDE Nico is also the only high waisted jean with high cotton content (98%) that I can wear without feeling like I have an external bowl obstruction whenever I sit down. I like it so much I own three pairs.  I also really like Mother and ParkerSmith. Mother's sizing is all over the place and as a result, are harder to shop for online (and more expensive than AGOLDE). ParkerSmith has more full length jeans than any other brand (I am so fucking tired of everything cropped) but definitely are more focused on basics and have less interesting colors, trendy silhouettes, hems, etc. Both these brands have nice material - substantial, high cotton content and yet forgiving.   For stretchy jeans, Frame or Yoga Jeans are super comfortable but honestly feel much more thin. They are not quite as "jegging" as other stretchy denim, but noticeably thin.   My least favorites are Lucky Brand and Rollas (~$100). Lucky Brand works amazing for my husband, but I've never tried a pair of their women's jeans that fit me well or made me feel like they were worth paying more for than standard Levis. Rollas are high quality denim, but they really go full on on the vintage denim thing and as a result, are just so stiff on me with boyishly unflattering cuts. I refuse to torture myself breaking in anything anymore. Mostly because I have in the past already tortured myself for several weeks on a pair of Rollas that did not in fact, "break in" as much as I needed it to to be comfortable.
text:For all recommending AGOLDE, how do you work out the sizing?  I’ve seen multiple reviews saying that you have to size down like 1-2 sizes or more. Still not sure what more AGOLDE offers for the price point, compared to Weekday or Levi’s (besides sustainability which is definitely a thing worth considering), but I’ve been interested in trying them for awhile.	labels:I have tried two pairs of AGOLDE jeans, the 100% cotton vintage flare and the Nico. The flare ran a full size big IMO, while the Nico ran big in the waist but TTS in the hip.	episode_done:True
text:When is a garment worth it to you?	labels:For most reasonably priced items, my rule is (unless there an urgent sale) to wait ~3-4 weeks. If I still want the item just as bad, I get it (or wait for a sale to get it). If I’m excited about something else, then so be lol  For expensive items, I do the same but also find an excuse (holiday, birthday, publish a paper, etc.)
text:This is good advice in general, the more expensive the item, the longer you should wait. I’ve been contemplating a need Audi for about a year, might pull the trigger next winter!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Do you follow the conventional rules around "flattering your figure?"	labels:In some ways yes and in other ways no.  I do try to appear conventionally thin with a visible waist. I try to show off my best features.   But I’m short and I don’t always follow the rules of things you should or shouldn’t wear because they make you look short. I am short, it’s noticeable. I will not suddenly look 5 inches taller because of the cut of my pants. No matter what you will see me and know I’m short. But I will wear skirts that highlight the best part of my legs, I’ll just still be short but with attractive (to me anyway) legs.	episode_done:True
text:What are your go-to, everyday shoes?	labels:Blundstones in the winter, white keds in the summer. I'm a simple gal. 🤷‍♀️  Side note, I wear orthodics so my shoe choices are based on whether I can rip out the insole and fit my orthodics. Unfortunately this means no sandals during the summer unless I really think it's worth it to sacrifice cuteness for knee pain!
text:Are Keds good as walking shoes?  I have a couple Supergas, but find they aren't best for super long walks/all day with lots of steps.	labels:I think generally you want something with a bit more of a curve to it. Keds are flat so they don't minic the natural shape of your foot. I just like them because my orthodics fit in them. 😊	episode_done:True
text:How do I feel more comfortable "dressing up"?	labels:I relate to this very much. I like really feminine blouses, dresses, skirts, etc. but rarely dress like that. If I wore a skirt and blouse I would get people commenting on how I'm dressed "fancy" and although they're compliments it made me feel sort of awkward and overdressed. One woman asked me if I was a foreign visitor and if there was any special culture or history behind my outfit when it was just something I thought was cute lol. Weird question for sure but she was genuinely curious and just trying to be nice.   Maybe it's since I usually wear t-shirt + jeans but I think it's mostly because athleisure/streetwear is the norm around here, especially in my age group, so it probably sticks out to be wearing a blouse when a lot of people don't seem to even own one. Even stuff like office clothing is uncommon here. We aren't in the city so fewer people are subject to business dress codes and there's a limited selection of shops, so you often see the same few popular items on a whole bunch of people. Plus, a lot of young people just can't be bothered to put more effort than just having clothes on at all; many people wear actual slippers outside and nobody bats an eye. Usually people aren't trying to be judgmental when I dress up but since it's simply not common, you can sort of see that they have a big question mark over their head.  That sort of environment sort of discouraged me from branching more into styles I'm into, but as I'm finding more pieces that I love, I want to work on gradually moving towards it. I think it's definitely something that gets better over time as "dressing up" just becomes dressing.   I remember seeing a post by a young woman who was into lolita fashion, and she said that as eye-catching and extravagant as her everyday outfits were, people around her sort of got used to it since she was always confident and stood by her preference for that kind of style as everyday clothes. She said that most people don't really know how or want to argue against "because I like this" when there isn't an enforced dress code.	episode_done:True

text:[Inspiration] Jewelry	labels:i got into jewlery for a bit at and might when pandemic ends and i go out again. i think the principle for it for people starting out is "more is more"--you need 3-4 pieces for it to look coordinated and not affected. I got a few pieces from [vitaly](https://www.vitalydesign.com/) for slightly cyberpunky stuff
text:IMO if you don't normally wear jewelry then the sweet spot is 3-5 items depending on whether you're wearing one type of piece (e.g. rings only) or mixing it up (rings/bracelets/chains/pendants etc.).  One item alone will draw too much attention to it. Two items says you're trying to do something but you're unsure of yourself. 3-5 is the sweet spot where the jewelry looks co-ordinated and blends into your outfit. 6+ is back to drawing too much attention to the jewelry and away from the outfit.  Of course if you have the confidence and have a rough idea of what you're doing you can pull anything off - there are no rules, really - but if you're just starting to introduce jewelry into your wardrobe and give off the vibe that you're not sure about your outfit people will pick up on it and their reactions will only make you feel less confident.	labels:As someone with no jewelry who’s trying to get into it this sounds good. Also, all the albums in the picture reflect this, which worries me.  I recently ordered a sterling silver ofuda necklace from ambush. I like the piece, but now I’m worried by itself it’ll call too much attention, even though it’s fairly simple. Considering the op said stainless is visually inferior next to silver, I guess I need to buy 2-3 more silver pieces before I can wear the ambush necklace? This philosophy would potentially make going into silver a somewhat serious investment.   I wonder if there’s some ability to mix stainless and silver in certain cases rather than going all in on or the other. Not sure how bad this would be, as I don’t have any experience with either material.	episode_done:True

It's like fine...they're nice, but they don't get me very excited. I'm also a bit of a forgetful person so switching a bag means trouble.  Also, I place a lot of value on my feet being comfortable. I walk a lot and and really hard on my shoes, so it's nice to look down and see that my shoes are nice.	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - November 11, 2020	labels:You can find some gems on Poshmark, but wow are the sellers inept compared to Grailed and eBay.  I don't get the logic of posting a shirt in the men's market, but then writing a description as to how it would fit a woman.  I've had a question about a vintage shirt's measurements go unanswered for two weeks now. The seller is a business.  I've seen seersucker listed as corduroy.
text:Poshmark trends towards lower price stuff so sellers can't spend much time on any listing if they want to make a decent wage. Also a lot of sellers are stay at home moms and this is their side gig along with parenting.  The organization stuff is frustrating, but the worst part is that plenty of things I reported for being in the wrong category would stay there for weeks or forever. The company also makes silly choices like putting sweatshirts under the shirt category, which means most sweatshirts go mistakenly in the sweater section somewhere instead because that's where people are looking for it. I've tried to contact them with suggestions but they just dead-end at customer service.	labels:I just checked. The seller has 13,685 active listings right now.

text:A discussion about “knockoff culture”	labels:I can say something about this from a EU design law (very very basic) point: In the EU, if you make your design public in any way, you have 3 years automatic protection. However, to prove that the other party is infringing, your design still has to meet the minimum requirements of design law, which means that it needs to be distinctive enough. To do this, you need to consider what else was around at the time the design came out.   For the low back body suit, I imagine theres plenty of low back body suits around, and it would be really difficult to prove that Sezane had something distinctive here.   With respect to the jumper, I think that the jumper itself is distinctive, but that VICI’s jumper is different enough (only single balls, balloon sleeves) that it would not infringe either.	episode_done:True

Ideally I like to return in store, but I have found a lot of the stores near me have closed this year so that is a more annoying option.  I also hate that so few brands include shipping labels, I do not have printer so that means I need to go to Fedex to print, and then drop off at UPS or postoffice. It is annoying (printing at UPS is too expensive).
text:Omg that would be unbearable to me (having to go to 2 different stores just to return something). Ugh.	labels:Yup so annoying!!!! Especially if I am trying something that has no brick and mortar.  I have two things to deal with now. And j.crew is lame and has a return fee - I don’t want to pay $8. They store that was super close closed, so now it means go to the one further out.  The other day I went to j.crew and assumed I could return to the gap near there, but it was closed. And I needed to go to banana republic, and they closed the women’s store and the gap was no longer there. So I needed to go to a different neighborhood for gap. SMH.

text:clothes that you've made or altered significantly by hand that you're particularly proud of?	labels:I've been knitting for a couple of years now and I've definitely gone into overdrive because of COVID. I've made a couple cropped sweaters for this fall already. I'm currently working on a thick burgundy wool coat WITH POCKETS(!), a turtleneck in pumpkin tweed, a variegated purple/white/green crop top with gold stellina to catch the light (this color way:https://dragonhoardyarnco.com/collections/the-chilling-adventures-of-sabrina-collection/products/forest-of-torment), and a pair of socks. I have some black mohair that I can't decide if I want to turn into a drapey top by itself or buy some thicker yarn to pair it with and make an extra soft sweater.  I'm about to head to bed, but I'll add photos in the morning. I'm extremely excited for the turtleneck because I should be finished knitting the last sleeve tomorrow and then I just need to block it and seam everything together! The pattern I used is this: http://veganmetalvamp.blogspot.com/2018/02/the-essentials-lumberjackie-cropped.html?m=1, but I added around 5 inches to the neck to make it a turtleneck. I also made this sweater in a forest green tweed two months ago and loved the fit enough to want a second.  The coat I'm making is this: https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/polar-coat  Edit: just woke up! Took some photos of my projects  https://imgur.com/a/7B4qe90

text:Anyone else feeling incredibly disconnected from the 'fashion world'?	labels:I live in France and there is definitely a big push on instagram via influencers for 'nouvelle vague' 60s-70 styles to be promoted as 'french/parisienne girl style' even though that is not actually what most French women wear,  but it is a style category that exists here. I like certain elements of this style but there are intellectual experts in recent years that have shown that the marketing push of this image nationally and internationally had lead to a lot of erasure of the diversity of French population. Luckily more and more media outlets are trying to show the diversity of French style. I love 'Dress Like A Parisian' blog that really instills how stylish french women create their style no matter what kind style 'identity' they gravitate to.  As for sources on instagram/pinterest etc. I have several: In terms of RTW,  I'm not the biggest fan of Hedi Slimane but his Celine collections since 2019 are very wearable and what I could see certain French demographics wearing. And I mine older Isabel Marant (pre 2015-2016) for inspiration to satisfy my bohemian itch. Other RTW I like is Dries Van Noten, Chloé, Old Céline, Virginie Viard's Chanel. On instagram, I follow certain hashtags of certain brands (typically high mid-end/independent designers many of them French)  to see how smaller influencers style certain brands.  Concept stores/Large mulit-brand boutiques also do a great job on insta with styling which helps me hone in my style. I still use Pinterest but it's easy to keep seeing the same pins to repin and it ruins the search for inspiration so I like mine instagram more and more often.	episode_done:True

The production and intended use/purpose of fast fashion is still the same regardless of what/how you end up using it. I get that fast fashion has a negative connotation so people want to talk themselves around being an active consumer or participant, but it doesn't change the larger picture of things. Being complicit in an oppressive and unjust system isn't actually a choice - it's not your individual fault. So yes it's fast fashion, yes you are "supporting" that industry, and yes you can feel badly about it while fully recognizing you have no meaningful control over the situation. It's difficult, but I think it's a better habit to try to learn to live with that instead of trying to convince yourself you're not a part of it.	episode_done:True

I'll wear leggings around the house that I stretched out the back of the calves so they look ridiculous, but I only wear boot cut or flair jeans. Lee jeans are my go to these days. I like black denim and they stay black as long as you don't put them in the dryer.    My bra HAS to have an under wire. Without one, I feel like my boobs are going to swing around and smack someone. But the second that under wire gets a bend or kink in it, it's ruined and I have to put a new under wire in it. I usually go to lane bryant with one of the sales.    Socks. Omg I have issues. They cannot have to thick of a toe stitch, they cannot slide down my heel in the least. I tense my feet when I'm anxious, so they really will hurt by the end of the day. I spend a good chunk of change on shoes and the right kind of socks but it's worth every penny, and they hold up really well so that's a bonus.    Most shirts are from Target. Plain stretch knits or t-shirts. I have some " special occasion" tops but one evening is about all I can handle in them. If they are bulky under the arms it's a total no go.

text:How to combine colors	labels:To be honest, a lot of these resources read like the kind of infographics MFA used to upvote; there's the trifecta of pseudo-objective diagrams (e.g. color wheels), dubious pop-psychology (e.g. colors' subconscious associations), and simple but misleading theory (e.g. "seasonal" color schemes) for lurkers looking for 'rules' to bind them.  And like those infographics, I feel that most of these are, at best, an attempt to transform the act of "looking at things and using your brain" into tractable but useless theory (compare: any time someone tries to create a head-shape matrix for glasses), and at worst pretty much junk (particularly the psychology bits). They're also usually based on the fucky assumption that a conventional white American beauty standard is objectively "correct."  Prevailing trends and cultural/subcultural context are way more meaningful determinants of how to use color than a set of temporally/culturally specific rules, and frankly I think the only way to understand those is experience: looking, doing, and thinking. "Caucasians shouldn't wear all black because it offsets their undertone and makes their skin look less vibrant," for instance, sounds reasonable up till you look at actual people who look perfectly fine in it.	episode_done:True

text:What are some habits that keep clothes/shoes new vs that habits that ruin them?	labels:When washing, zip, button, and tie absolutely everything; turn each piece inside out (and while you're doing that, clip any loose threads); put shirts, sweaters, underwear, and anything else you care about in their own lingerie bags (the ones branded Tide are great); separate by color *and* weight; never use hot water; use minimal soap and/or run an extra rinse cycle with a cup of white vinegar in it to get rid of soap residue; only use the dryer for linens and towels and then only on low; avoid dryer sheets. Oh, and dab a bit of clear nail polish on the thread of each button when you first take the tags off a garment -- your buttons will stay on much longer.

text:Having a Tough Time Finding Retailers for My Style	labels:So, look, I don't want to tell you _not_ to do this, but if I've understood correctly you're looking at creating a bloodborne-inspired victorian/traditional wardrobe. There are elements of that style that have mainstream appeal today, high-waisted wool trousers being one example. However, when you take them in context with the more "interesting" elements you picked out it gives off serious cosplay vibes. Perhaps you should take the fact that the only places offering this sort of clothing are Etsy/cosplay stores as a hint that you should reconsider this idea.  You might be thinking, _what about the cyber goth vampire Rick Owens fits I see on this sub?_ It's a valid question. The key difference is that the style you're going for here has _such_ a strong association with cosplay and videogames and so little mainstream appeal that the number one association people are going to make is that you are cosplaying. Doubly-so if you're wearing cosplay-quality clothes from cosplay vendors. While the Rick Owens aesthetic may not have mainstream appeal it _is_ very accepted within fashion circles and _doesn't_ have that strong cosplay association.  So with that said my advice is to take what you've got and tone it down. Treat it like a high-fashion runway show and take inspiration from it instead of trying to recreate it 1:1. High-waisted trousers, great. Gaiters? Maybe just get some actual boots. Bloodborne-style woolen collars/scarves/hooded shawls? Wear a regular scarf that has an interesting shape or texture, or a shirt with a more exaggerated collar. Maybe the fact that you can't find retailers selling this kind of stuff is the limitation you need to make it work in the real world.  Or maybe I'm just talking complete shite and someone smarter than me can help you more. I hope that I've at least broken the ice and said what needed to be said so that people can try to constructively help you.
text:I agree with you 100%. The sleeve thing, gaiters, and video game style collar things are a recipe for disaster. Maybe the aesthetic is possible to pull off, but it would require very high quality pieces and someone who is really good at this kind of thing. It's one of those, if you need to ask for advice, there is no way you could pull it off scenarios. As terrible as it is, I'd probably chuckle if I saw someone wearing any of those accessories at a bar or something. I'm just picturing someone alone at a dive drinking some shitty (or very oddly expensive for the bar) single malt whisky alone approaching random people and trying to talk about outdated philosophers. Even just the high rise pants look seems very intimidating to me. I'm always very impressed by the people on MFA who pull it off. It seems like one of those things where if you pull it off you look incredibly fashionable, but if you fuck it up just a little you end up looking  wholly ridiculous.	labels:And I won't know until I try it :) Have faith that I know what I'm doing	episode_done:True

text:It looks like the sleeves are the actual only parts of the jacket made from leather, and it’s going to be poor quality leather. I’d recommend against buying a leather jacket from a fast fashion retailer when you dollar could go much farther buying used from Grailed or the like.   The suede on the sleeves will likely be very thin and show lighter crease marks in the elbow. The body isn’t even leather, the detailed information says it’s wool and synthetic fibres. Regardless, for $200 you will never get the high quality leather that a jacket should be crafted from.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 15, 2020	labels:I'm always afraid that there are good brands out there that I am just not aware of.  I am thinking of getting a pair of black shoes to go with slacks / jeans.  I really like Meermin.  I'm also aware of Cole Hahn, Allen Edmonds, Johnston.  Are there any go-to brands that I have not mentioned?  Recommendations?  Also, what is your opinion of wearing boots, say Frye boots, with black slacks?
text:ac106 had some great suggestions. I’ll come about it from another perspective — there will always be good brands out there that even the most seasoned veterans aren’t aware of. And that’s fine. What matters is that you’ve found *some* brands out there that are better than the vast majority of others, and you just got recommendations to a lot of them.   Since you mentioned you’d wear them with chinos, I’d also suggest dressier brands closer to Meermin pricing such as Velasca Milano, Morjas, Löf and Tung, Berwick, TLB Mallorca, Yanko, and Cheaney.	labels:Thank you for this.  Sometimes fashion gives me such anxiety.  For example, the reason I asked about boots with slacks is because I had just read an article on here that said never wear Oxfords with anything other than a suit.  I wear Oxfords with a lot of things, i. e. slacks.  So I felt shamed, lol.  I know that bluchers are an option, but to me, they remind me of nurse's clogs a lot of the time.	episode_done:True

text:How have you changed your style and/or shopping habits after your body has changed?	labels:Hmm, not sure I have a lot to contribute but I have had to change my style quite a bit on a few occasions in my life in the last 5ish years, and it's left my closet in shambles. First was when I moved from a trendy college town to a trailer on a ranch (lol, I f***ing hated it). So all my cute shit went bye bye and I basically only had clothes I could feed pigs and cows in. Then I moved to kind of a trendier metropolitan suburb and got to wear nice things again, then moved to a very casual city and had a baby, so all my cute stuff became ugly casual stuff again. Still trying to sort things out so I can look good and feel good while balancing my new lifestyle, new body, and the local culture.	episode_done:True

text:Spend $250 on a good replica bag or Tory Burch?	labels:I would go with a real Coach or Tory Burch (although I think $250 for a Tory Burch bag will be difficult to pull off unless you hit a good sale or you like a small bag).  Another thought is to look at a reputable reseller like What Goes Around, Comes Around or Bag Borrow Steal if you want a high end bag for less money. Carrying a fake (and I do have some) just doesn’t have the same feel. I’m always paranoid that someone will know that my bag is fake. If you do Coach, check the outlet if possible. I got a beautiful cream colored pebble leather hobo, matching wallet, and lipstick holder (which I bought because it’s just adorable) for $180 total—this was 1/3 of the regular outlet price.	episode_done:True
text:If you had $5,000 to What-Not-To-Wear style re-do your whole wardrobe, how would you do it? What would be your process?

Good shoes also!!!	episode_done:True
text:What did your mom teach you about fashion/style - and what did she not teach you?	labels:This is a really interesting question. I do not really remember my mom teaching me anything specific about style and fashion.  My mom is anti-makeup. She was one of those people who used the same tube of lipstick for 20 years. I feel like both of my grandmas did the same. My maternal grandma only wore lipstick to church. My paternal grandma put on lipstick when she left the house. Neither wore more makeup. I think part of this is related to their not really being a lot of foundation choices for Black women. I mean even now I only have a handful of options, it is getting better but it isn't easy. So I have never really been one for a lot of makeup. I go in waves of putting on mascara. And some lip product when going out. Day to day it is basically nothing, ocassionally highlighter. I focus on trying to take care of my skin. Probably because makeup wasn't really an option.  My mom has/had 7 sisters. Some of my aunts wore makeup and my mom was always like "that is so weird!" She in particular complained about one of her older sisters who over plucked as a teen young adult and had to draw in her eyebrows for the rest of her life. That totally made me scared to wax/thread/pluck. I did for a bit, but my brows never came back after that, so now it is like never. I have sparse brows (I am 42).  My mom and her siblings were all very stylish and fashion oriented. My mom was known as the best dressed PTA mom. She always had super cool big earrings too. My mom had a style point of view, while she cared about fashion. But she also had some weird body hangups. (She is a slim pear shape - hated her legs, and was opposed to bathing suits).  One of my fave stories about my mom is how she always told us that when she was in her 20s and living in DC/Chicago she said she was always checking out the prostitutes for style tips. She tells us they were super stylish. LOL.  As a kid, I think my mom had fun helping us be "stylish" but she was also very old school in some ways, and we had to wear dresses/skirts/tights/hose/slips for any dress up occasion. It was scandalous to go bare legged! I had to beg to do it when I got to high school in the spring and summer. It was not allowed at church. (She wasn't anti-pants - just for dress up occasions).  I think her way to instill "fashion" into me was to subscribe to all the fashion magazines! I had all those teen ones growing up: Sassy, YM, Seventeen, and later Vogue. But before I had my own magazines to read, I was always looking a Jet and Soap Opera Digest to see their outfits (mom's magazines).  Things were always a bit tricky for me, because once I hit puberty, I was basically at the top of the size range and had a curvy figure that was hard to fit. I was also way bustier than my mom. She was in the small band B cup range and I was more like an medium band H (though I didn't find that out later).  When my mom turned 40ish, she decided she was an old lady, and needed to dress like one. So she started wearing those shapeless elastic waist pants, baggy shirts, and those "nurses" shoes as they were called. She has been dressing that way in the last 30 years - plus random remnants of my and my sisters high school wardrobes.  I do not really feel like my mom really said much in particular about fashion - beyond setting up the rules like - no cleavage! Don't show off your butt! And this conservative southern mom rules she had. She was always concerned about us being perceived as "fast" so she wanted to keep us covered up. Other than that it was dressing appropriate for the occasion. I was able to experiment how ever I wanted.  My mom always had a large wardrobe, and she loved to bargain hunt. She was opposed to spending money on clothing (my dad was always willing to invest). So when clothing shopping in the pre-autonomy days, we always went to Kmart/Ross/TJ Maxx. We'd try to get dad to take us to the mall to go to Esprit and Nordstrom - because mom wouldn't pay for that stuff, but dad would! When we got older (middle school-ish), the shopping process changed. Mom would take us to get the basics, and then we would have a discretionary budget to use for whatever clothing we wanted, and we'd get dropped off at the mall to choose whatever.  But to be honest, I do not remember limits on what I could choose - other than using those rules.  I feel like my mom was good about directly teaching us how things should fit. And while I haven't really gotten my own tailoring down, she was a passable sewist, and she made some of her own alterations on clothing. So I learned that things could be adjusted. She always needed to hem her pants (she is tall with short legs) and take in the waist.  My mom had no clue about dressing for a busty figure. I guess or a larger one. But while my sister and I are a good big larger than mom, we are lucky in the sense that we have hourglass-y shapes which still have some of the same issues she had as a pear shape so it was transferable.  I guess the most important rules from mom were really about understanding what to wear for a particular occasion.  I have no plans to have kids, but I love helping other people shop - and my number one lesson is to try all sorts of stuff on, you never know if it'll work! And experiment, experiment. And of course about proper fit as much as possible.

text:Best and Worst Purchase of 2020	labels:Best purchase by far was an actual wool sweater from Aran Sweater market. Completely opened my eyes to how high quality materials matter and made me rethink how I view budgeting for clothes and my day to day outfit.   (Side note, because I had never had anything wool before I was *sure* people were lying when they said wool wouldn't have to be washed to get rid of smells. I'm still baffled 8 moths later about how this damn sweater stays fresh when everything else gets stinky after like one day)  My worst one was another scarf when I don't and have never worn scarves. I *think* I want to be a scarf person but I'm really not, and it's a waste of money every time.

I don't worry much about the price of the clothes on the website, but I do worry that they could be making a humongous 90% profit by just reselling

We actually don’t re-sell any clothing that is made by the artisans or in Mexico.

If anyone has experience with them would a size up possibly work? I'm very broad shouldered but the non slim version is too bulky.	episode_done:True
text:What are the pros and cons of dressing the way that you do?	labels:I'd describe my style as high glam. Almost Kim Kardashian-esque (but significantly less naked because my body doesn't look like that lmao). Love a good body con dress, plunging neckline, silks and shimmers, cutouts, high slits, and stilettos.   Pro: compliments. I can't even lie, I love the compliments lol. I really enjoy the moment of walking into a room and everyone turning to look at me and saying how good I look. Also love that I have a lot of friends who consider me some kind of fashion authority. Not just for going-out looks, either -- for weddings and job interviews and first dates.   Con: high glam often reads sexy, which I don't inherently mind, but it has gotten me unwanted, sexually-aggressive attention. The whole "she looks like she wants it" thing for showing cleavage. People also tend to think I'm ditzy because I like to show skin, when in reality I'm a federal attorney with a background in neuroscience.... maybe this is a pro, because I actually kinda love the moment of shock and embarrassment when they realize I'm extremely smart, likely much smarter than they are 🤣
text:tbh this sounds so fun. like yes, the aggressive sexualization is no bueno. generally tho, i love the elle mills-esque attitude you can carry here, and it's your prerogative how you want to portray your body and style, ya know?	labels:It definitely is a fun dichotomy!! A lil risky sometimes but hey... here for a good time, not a long time 🤷‍♀️😂	episode_done:True
text:How many clothes do you have? (Really?)	labels:I’m not a minimalist at all and love to buy things second hand on depop when I want to try a new trend out.  With recently off loading a decent chunk of clothes, I have  -strappy/blousey tops: 32,  -t-shirts/sweatshirts: 20,  -sweaters: 23,  -jackets/blazers/coats: 14,  -rompers/dresses/overalls: 16,  -skirts: 4,  -slacks/jeans: 15,  -shorts: 4, and  -shoes: 17. Personally, I’m 22 and like to dress fun and cute most of the time but also I am in a medical program and have to have a business casual wardrobe that is nice and clean but also has pieces I can layer in for practicality and they just don’t translate to pieces I wear daily! So I have a decent amount of clothes I don’t wear often but are very practical for me. I’ve also lost a fair amount of weight recently and am still working on that front so I have had to buy more pants that actually fit me. Hoping to get the ones that don’t fit as well taken in later as they’re still in great shape just loose.	episode_done:True

text:What clothing items have you reverted back to since WFH/quarantine?	labels:I've really been embracing dressing more youthful. I'm in my early/mid 20s, and now that I've worked a couple years at the same place, I'm wearing more what I want than boring professional. I also started caring about what I wear and planning my outfits. Velvet shoes, corduroy overalls, rainbow prints, sequins, bold colors. Who cares? I've been called out for dressing "fancy" before, but I've stopped giving a shit in correlation with my confidence in my abilities. I'm a teacher...if anything, I'm showing the students it's okay to be yourself and take risks.
text:This is me, but in my early thirties!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Style rut: Pinterest vs reality	labels:I think 'fashionable' and skinny/ white/ young etc. get confused a lot. A young, thin, white conventionally attractive woman wears and oversized tee and some leggings and its a 'look', and if I do that I've given up on myself.   I also think the overall styling of a look plays into whether its fashionable or not. A lot of the people you see on pinterest/ insta are wearing tailored clothes or have the photos edited or the clothes pinned at the back to make it look perfect. Hair and make up are also a part of how 'done up' you look.   Also, its not okay for people to be making comments that are hurtful even if they're not intending to hurt you. Its okay to say you're not okay with that.

text:Everything I have from them has been such good quality for a "mainstream/mall" brand. Like, really really nice. And they have amazing sales. Sometimes they seem a little "mature," but if you do your own mixing and matching, their stuff works with a lot of different styles.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What’s your opinion on (modern) 90s-inspired fashion?	labels:As a baby of the 80s/90s, I'm here for it! This is my first cycle of fashion "coming back," and it's pretty fun to see a new generation reinterpret the style I saved my allowance to buy from Limited Too. That being said, as a 30-something, I'm not diving in too deep, as this aesthetic feels a bit young and maximalist for my style.  The trend seems to be permeating home decor too... I'm mentoring a high schooler through a women in STEM program, and we had a Zoom date the other night. Her bedroom looked like the set of Clarissa Explains It All and it was strangely comforting.
text:I would love to see a modern reboot of that show. I wanted to be her as a girl, and I am now her mother as an adult. I watched the show the other day and nothing the mom said seemed wierd or over the top.... So yeah.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What to do when nothing fits you properly?	labels:You could be me, only I am about 4 kg heavier. But I was also never comfortable and tried to hide my hips and nothing fit right and all the pants were too short on me. I now mostly wear sweater dresses and skirts to work, since it's more comfy and not too tight. Plus you can't really tell I have knock knees if skirt ends right at the knees.  But my best tip for pants is S'Oliver. Not the cheapest, but they have decent sales and their 36" length jeans were the only ones that were long enough. I would stay away from high waisted dresses and skirts, as they make me look completely disproportionate, but that depends, maybe your torso isn't that short.  Sorry for the ramble, I am just excited to find someone with the same problems I had.

text:Rick Owens Wearing Rick Owens	labels:I don't own a single piece of his clothing, and I probably never will, but one of the quotes attributed to him that really stuck with me when I first started browsing mfa was "No outfit is going to make you look or feel as good as having a fit body. Buy less clothing and go to the gym instead." He was right.
text:That's probably the single most recognizable quote of his outside diehard avant-garde fashion circles. It needs some contextualizing though. Like everything else, you have to consider where the speaker is coming from. Rick is addicted to working out. He's on steroids. His addiction is understandable because before he got into working out he was doing drugs and was, by his own admission, on a very unhealthy path. His wife got him into working out instead. But he's effectively swapped one addiction for another. Working out is generally one of the best things you can do for your health, but not when you're pushing 60 and regularly taking steroids. When it comes to that Rick quote, it's worth knowing that he's not speaking from a well-balanced position.  All that is to say, the general spirit of the quote is solid advice. But Rick Owens is probably not a good authority on moderation, which as with all activities, should be a part of your workout routine.	labels:[removed]	episode_done:True

text:What did people *actually* wear in 2000's?	labels:Is anyone going to talk about scene kid fashion or do I have to do it?? My uniform in like 2004/5 was low rise hollister skinny jeans, PUFFY ETNIES skater sneakers (+1 if they were the black sneakers with hot pink laces with stars) or crazy colored converse and a white studded belt, some terrible local bands t shirt and side bangs. Not just regular side bangs but side bangs that hid one eye completely   Then later we all discovered hairspray so we all got super choppy long mullets and teased the shit out of them. And still had side bangs but even swoopier and more comb-overy   Makeup was full bottom(!) waterline black eyeliner and the NUDE Mac lipstick that looked like foundation  * edit: I do remember my first pair of high waisted black skinny jeans in maybe 2007/8 and boy howdy did those BDGs change my life. Also this memory makes me feel very old because I can distinctly pinpoint the periods in my life when I aged into and then aged out of urban outfitters. D:  * edit edit : wow wow ok so I do remember in the very early 2000s (maybe 2001?) a friend of mine being extremely excited to wear a sleeveless collared tank with a tie(??) to the first day of middle school a la Avril Lavigne and that was THE COOLEST

Opt for a more rugged material than your airy summer whites like [white denim](https://imgur.com/rtB5Fog) or [a hearty twill](https://imgur.com/Fq3uR2a) or white cords.  Try something more rugged like [cargo pants](https://imgur.com/zMlB15d) or [double knee pants](https://imgur.com/PugqTgk) or my favorite [carpenter pants](https://imgur.com/QjnQSPJ).  Pair them with [fall boots](https://imgur.com/NqnmKiK), [textured suede](https://imgur.com/Hq8GAVh), [chukkas](https://imgur.com/DPznaUD), [retro white sneakers](https://imgur.com/mJlVXAl) or [a pop of color](https://imgur.com/cS3lrSs)
text:> I think the "no white after labor day" is a dumb rule  I love how vague the rule is. Like, when is it considered no longer "after Labor Day?" It's like Gremlins, any time you feed them after their first night being alive is "after midnight."   It really is a dumb rule, the right white during the right time is so versatile, you really nailed it with this post!	labels:Also it's such an *American* rule.

About $1500 gone.

French brands with a modern, slightly bohemian style.  If you like French style and also Scandinavian Style, you might like A.P.C.

text:How do you handle budget increases when it comes to clothes? (ex. going from student to working professional)	labels:I've been in the process of a style overhaul. I've spent way more money than I care to admit on new clothes over the past few months, but I've also changed my approach to clothes from "this is cute and I can wear it a few times before I get tired of it" to "this is expensive, but it's high quality and versatile".   Going from a fast fashion mindset that worked for me as a teen and college student to one that's geared more for law school and overall investment pieces has been pricey. But what works for me is to look at what I already have and find what I'm lacking. I can then target my search for clothes to that specific item instead doing impulse buys for clothes that I only kind of like. So I can purposely search for a top,a sweater, or pair of jeans that fits with what I already have in my wardrobe instead, when I used to just buy something that I thought was cute and worry about how to style it later.  It's a pricey investment upfront, but it will save me money long term because I'm not replacing all of my cheap clothes from the mall every few months. Instead, I'm consciously buying more expensive pieces that will last. The bonus is that the more expensive pieces are making people take me more seriously, which is what I need when I start law school. Instead of buying 4 cheap, polyester shirts from the mall that also make me look cheap, I can instead get an investment piece that's special and fits perfectly.	episode_done:True

Those are my “everyday” earnings. I have two sterling silver bangles from Greece that I wear almost everyday as well. I wear a lot of simple clothing in black or neutrals so I tend to buy chunky silver pieces that stand out against the clothing. I love rings and earrings and big cuff bracelets so I have a nice collection of those pieces that I switch up depending on seasons and mood.	episode_done:True
text:What to do when nothing fits you properly?	labels:I think you might be a bit too tall for size M or 38. Buy a bigger size and take it to the tailor to sinch the clothes (which is not expensive in Balkan tbh). My sister is 175 cm and she has to buy size 40 because in smaller size something is always too short. She also regularly takes the clothes to the tailor. You can also try ASOS, they have a tall section.	episode_done:True
text:What will be obsolete by summer 2021?	labels:Puffy sleeves will be out by next summer I think. Even before coronavirus they were starting to trend (I know I got mine late last year) and I think people leaned into them hard this year with the whole whimsical cottage core trend that was the result of lockdown and the rise of baking & home arts, not to mention the only safe outings this year being outdoor nature things. But next year people will be so into going out that I think the romantic & idyllic nature of the puffy sleeves will be not favored. Or if they do continue it will be in a more dramatic, stylized 80s way and not the romantic snow white vibes way. Many of the major fashion labels had a huge trend of historical silhouettes and detailing for fall/ winter 2020, so I don’t think it’ll go away this winter, but I think the “fresh look” next spring & summer won’t include them
text:I hope this trend dies! It’s almost hard to find a blouse right now that doesn’t have puffed shoulders and a puffy cuff. Drives me nuts bc I have broad shoulders already and the puffiness of the whole sleeve just looks so bulky and un-chic to me.	labels:Drives me nuts too because I’m a big fan of cardigans and layering, they don’t fit under other things!	episode_done:True

She constantly tells me that I dress like a lesbian and am an "honorary lesbian." I'm flattered tbh! I just wear pants, button up shirts, and have a maximum 4-5 pairs of shoes for all seasons. I clip my keys to my belt loop too... It's just functional!   It sounds boring and minimalist, but I actually feel more "stylish" like this, more than when I had tons of dresses and more girly, "fashionable" clothes in the past. It was all disjointed and random. Now I have a really consistent look that feels true to myself. It's also pretty easy to rock an androgynous look. My typical outfit is a loose, black, long sleeved button up, black jeans, and docs. I don't have any purses. I have 3 necklaces and I wear them often for a feminine touch. I wear one tiny hoop earring.   The funniest part is that she says my husband dresses like a lesbian too, and she's not wrong.
text:Straight woman here as well. I also clip my keys to my pants . Haha I had no idea it was a “tell” until I read this thread. I drove a Subaru for a while too ......	labels:Bi here, but I also had no idea it meant anything. People have been side-eyeing me for clipping my keys to my belt loops and now I know why 😳	episode_done:True
text:General Discussion - December 07, 2020	labels:There seems to be more guys wearing earrings, especially mismatched or double pierced ears. Those of you who wear earrings, when, where, and why did you get them pierced? What types do you like to wear? Guys who want earrings, what's stopping you?
text:I have 2 in each ear and got them done around 1987 or 88.  I don't really wear earrings anymore but I do put some in a couple times a year to see if they've closed.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 20, 2020	labels:What do y'all think of [this GAP shirt](https://imgur.com/a/zotxfAq) for someone who's practically married to the plain T-shirt and jeans look? I loved the color, but I usually wear black or navy T-shirts. It is linen, do you think I'll survive the usual hot weather?
text:Linen is specifically made for hot weather. Looks like a good shirt.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:[Inspiration] Sculptural Jewelry	labels:Awesome stuff. I’d totally wear 10, 11, 12, 15, 17 and if I’d time to think of a concept, 20 (idk, for a fancy dinner or something). 15 in particular seems fairly easy to work with.  On the tamer side, I fell in love with [this Ann D bangle](https://wear.net/item/19503669/) a while ago, but then ended up with [Parts of 4](https://partsof4.com/collections/bracelets/products/crescent-rift-bracelet-30mm-as). Po4 is great for a more minimalist take on this stuff, but gotten a bit pricy recently.
text:10 is a combo of leather cuff and wooden bangle. I really wanted it until I realized the bangle would be too small for me. 11 is Rick Owens and I've seen it look great in streetwear. I think there's a regular poster on FFA who has a variant of those bracelets. 12 is almost the same thing. I agree on 15. 17 is more challenging, but I love the craftsmanship. It's silver and I'd have never guessed that. For 20 I love body jewelry. It's hard to find good pieces because there's a lot of crap out there, but the good stuff is really striking.  I love the Parts of 4 bangle you got. The acid silver is a great effect that mutes the sheen really well.	labels:Yeah, shiny silver is just too stark against all black, so the acid finish really works for me. I think 11 and 12 stuck out for me because I see a similar use case (chunky, but a bit ethereal and muted -- at least I'm assuming that 12 is a matte white).  The issue with 17 is that it is very 3 dimensional (though that is the point of course). I think I'd balance it with some weird shoulders or something like this.  Body jewelry is great, but I think I'll never have the means for the good stuff.	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - November 13, 2020	labels:There is exactly one store I don't mind going to during the pandemic, and that store is Trader Joe's.
text:you have any recommendations? love hearing what people swear by there because you always learn something   also shout out to /r/traderjoes	labels:Oh man.  -	Dark chocolate covered espresso beans -	Dark chocolate peanut butter cups -	Dark chocolate mint creams -	Cookie butter -	Cookie butter ice cream -	Ghost pepper waffle cut potato chips -	Frozen beef and broccoli -	Frozen wood fired pepperoni pizza -	Frozen pork bao buns -	Everything bagel flavored cashews and almonds -	Buffalo chicken dip (I put this on some sourdough toast for a quick lunch)  Their soy chorizo and cheeses are also amazing as well.	episode_done:True
text:Formula for a put together outfit that works for most aesthetics	labels:"If your hair has a lot of personality" comes off uhm. Quite interestingly. You might want to specify what you mean - does curly hair have "a lot of personality"? Bright ginger hair? Natural afro? Just a suggestion to think about the assumptions you're making when you picture a put together look.
text:This isn't about visualizing a "put together look". I'm not really sure how assumptions would come into it. I saw the same videos OP did (they're by @elizabethfortmeyer on tiktok) and it's just a check for yourself as you're getting ready and learning how to put together an outfit. It's really just a way of summarizing different visual interest (like the idea that you should vary textures in an all black outfit).	labels:ty for remembering the person!! I will edit the post to credit her.	episode_done:True

text:Those are /u/fluxknot's jeans from Siki Im	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What did people *actually* wear in 2000's?	labels:Well most cycles of fashion is a new take on an era, not an exact replica, so authentic 2000s wouldn’t be in style, but a 2020 take on it would.   I was in college and we wore low rise flares and tight fitting long tops. I mean, we wanted to look like we had the longest torso and lowest butt ever!!! It was a time to be alive. We wore shiny shit to the clubs and our moms told us not to look like we were wearing our jammies because it was all lingerie-looking.   We lived for a layered look but a fuckin stupid one, like a cami over a t shirt. Or a scarf with a tank top.  I even wore a skirt over JEANS and they were flared wtf.
text:Jean shorts over leggings is making a comeback and honestly I’m here for it.	labels:I’m kind of hoping the later/2010s? look of tweedy or black workwear-material shorts over tights will come back because i never got to wear it the first time around- my mum said it looked ridic but EVERYONE else was wearing it.	episode_done:True

text:Pantone Color(s) of the year for 2021: Illuminating and Ultimate Gray	labels:I love yellow & I love gray, in most shades, but these in particular just feel so... textbook Crayola starter pack to me? Like, in a vacuum they could be the platonic ideal of yellow and gray, so I can kind of appreciate how they are both true mid-tones, but I don't like them together (for some reason it's giving me flashbacks to the chevrons and turquoise of 2010 decor) and I don't find them particularly inspiring right off the bat.  Or it could be that as a warm-toned olive I know they will both look terrible on me, lol.
text:It kind of reminds me of Target in the summer?	labels:Its the color of their clearance signs	episode_done:True
text:People with an over the top personal style, how do you incorporate it into your day to day?	labels:As someone who dresses like an absolute nut job I have learned that generally speaking as long as your outfit is overall appropriate for the situation, you can get away with murder. Like I wouldn't wear a sequined micro mini or ballgown to my office job, but I would absolutely wear a velvet suit and a bunch of brooches. I have also noticed that when I wear pieces that I love, my confidence increases throughout the day. Sometimes I have moments in the day where I look down and think "dang, this outfit is cool and I feel cool!" Those moments just give me a boost of confidence all on their own. The last thing is that people are generally too busy with their own lives to notice what you're wearing. They're doing them, so do you and have fun with it!   edit-words

text:What are your coziest winter finds/essentials?	labels:My lululemon wunder puff jacket long! I’m almost 5’10 and live in Ohio. It goes way past my knees. It’s a walking cozy sleeping bag! I got it on sale in January of this year and it’s my favorite!   Also northface mule traction booties! So cozy for dog walks and running errands.	episode_done:True
text:How do I improve my fashion sense beyond just tshirt and jeans?	labels:Your question reminded me of [this blog post](https://www.extrapetite.com/2010/05/reader-request-how-to-look-older-in.html) by Extra Petite. I suggest you take a look at it! It's about upgrading from a "teenager" look but remaining casual.

text:I am seeing TikToks that are calling skinny jeans “outdated” now lol. Tbh tho, idk what pants are in style anymore cuz I haven’t left my house in a few months due to COVID so I don’t see anyone wear anything that isn’t...pajamas.	labels:>I am seeing TikToks that are calling skinny jeans “outdated” now lol.  This thread makes me realize I'm somehow light years behind and out of the loop. It seems like it was only a few months to a year ago that this sub was talking about how skinny jeans will never go out of style at this point.   /_-  I'm dying. This is the thread I didn't know I needed.	episode_done:True
text:Hedi Slimane’s CELINE- an idealized look at 1960s rock & roll (large inspiration album)	labels:My friend, I have to ask you what you thought of Hedi’s Fall 2021 collection. Parts of it felt distinctly Hedi, there were many elements that surprised me.
text:I actually really enjoyed it- I think the production and the whole setting and artistic focus of the video is way more interesting than a traditional runway show so that’s for the benefit of us at home I think it’s a great way to show.  The clothes themselves felt very dancing kid for winter, and while a lot of people got really upset about that collection I’m not mad about it, nor am I about this one. Like you said some cool pieces, not a ton that I would wear but I liked seeing some of the more experimental pieces like the huge boots.	labels:We are of the same mind then! It is an interesting point you made. People have complained about him being predictable and now that he is switching it up, people still complain. 🤷🏼‍♂️ Thank you for weighing in!	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 14, 2020	labels:Hey guys, looking to flesh-out my wardrobe soon and need some help listing online retailers/stores.  Uk based and into workwear pieces/relaxed fits.  Anyone have any websites to throw at me?
text:Dries did nothing wrong	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What rules do you break for your body type?	labels:I've lost 85 pounds. My boobs are by no means as perky as they "should be" for my age. They sat low on my chest even before weight loss. They never gave me any cleavage, even when I was a 38F. That's just how I've always been built.   Now I refuse to wear bras. I'm willing to wear bralettes to formal occasions (like if I'm a bridesmaid) and job interviews, but I'm never wearing a bra again.   Now I only buy clothes that look good on my body exactly how it naturally is, instead of buying underwear to force my body to look good in the clothes. My body looks fine, it's the clothes that are designed wrong (for my body).   Lots of low cut things, despite having no cleavage and not attempts at cleavage. It just balances out my hips and the lower cut makes things seem perkier, haha. I don't care if I "don't have the tits" for it.	episode_done:True
text:Inspo Album: Small Asian-Owned Brands, Featuring Pockets & Architectural Details	labels:This is an awesome album! Thanks for putting it together. I'm especially into the work wear from Shirt Number White.  I'd like to mention a couple of Indian brands that fall into this category (and ship to the US):  [No Nasties](https://www.nonasties.in/collections/women) They have a lot of casual wear, but there are some pieces that have interesting drapes and silhouettes.  [Style Mati](https://www.stylemati.in/) A lot of oversized silhouettes in casual and work wear  If people have more recommendations of brands/designers from countries that haven't been mentioned, that would be great to see too!
text:I adore No Nasties.  The name kinda threw me when I first heard but when I saw the designs I was hooked.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- October 30	labels:Anyone have any idea about the quality of Billy Ruffian or Sanders Chelsea boots?

Any input would be appreciated, thanks!
text:At that price Meermin is a solid option with many positive reviews to back it up.	labels:But just to confirm, you have no opinions on the two brands or indeed boots posted?	episode_done:True
text:Can we discuss how uncomfortable it can be to dress fashionably sometimes? Must beauty = pain? Looking for comfort tips!	labels:I can't do uncomfortable anymore. Just won't. I would try to figure out what you like in a look and then work on how to have the look in comfort. For example, I like the height of heels but don't want my foot at a steep angle all day. For me clog type shoes and shooties have been an answer. Brands that work with your shape help, too. Curvy pants for me work better even after significant weight loss because they better mirror my shape. Considering fabrics helps, too. Sometimes a knit can be more forgiving than a weave. Sleeves that aren't long enough and  cause tightness across the back of a blouse are one of my pet peeves. To be avoided at all cost.   Be prepared to return things if you order on line and they don't live up to your standards for comfort. Assume you can do it and you will do it. I am like 100 (60...) and I own my look finally. Sh$%canning uncomfortable things has been a significant part of that.
text:If anyone has good recs for curvy pants pls help! I have a 26” waist and 40” hips and heck... i can never fit my buns into pants	labels:I have the opposite issue. I am very rectangular (im a bit chubby and I dont have hips) I am seconding this statement and asking - does anyone have pants ideas for a 36ish hip/33 waist girl?	episode_done:True
text:If you had $5,000 to What-Not-To-Wear style re-do your whole wardrobe, how would you do it? What would be your process? What would you prioritize?	labels:I’m an athletic trainer. They had one on the show one time and they tried to upgrade her clinic wardrobe, which I totally get, but upgrading our work wardrobe is not practical. On a standard day, I come home from a football game covered in sweat, blood, and a whole bunch of other stuff. If I’m lucky, it’s all mine. I’m not going to spend $150 on a pair of pants when that’s my work environment.   Now my personal wardrobe, I would go to town. Granted, most of it would be upgraded versions of my standard jeans, etc., to be better material. And I would most definitely upgrade my accessories and outerwear. But overall I like my personal wardrobe (assortment of nerdy shirts) and my occasional nice pieces.	episode_done:True

text:As someone who has a wishlist of very specific shoes and is sad when no one ever buys them for me, get her the shoes if possible (unless you know someone else is getting them for her). Idk if it seems like the boring gift since you’re just getting her what she asked for, but guaranteed it’s 100% a better present than something that’s a complete surprise that she doesn’t actually want, or worse, the “here are some shoes that are pretty much the same right?!” Idk I might just be projecting too much here 😂	labels:	episode_done:True
text:General Discussion - January 20, 2021	labels:should i be feeling guilty about moving something on for more than double the price of what I got it for?  I picked up something from the women's section on ebay that was mens, and for dirt cheap. I intended to wear it myself but the fit didn't work out and I managed to move it on for more than double the price. (But still less than half retail).  I kinda wanna pat myself on the back for finding such a deal, but at the same time I wonder if I did a fellow dude dirty.
text:That's perfectly fine imo. You purchased something with the intention of wearing it and it didn't work out. I think it's worse when people buy clothes for 70-80% off and then try to flip them for higher without even attempting to try it on/return it.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 26, 2020	labels:Do [these](https://postimg.cc/T5gR0xfm) two colors fit? Kinda navy and blackish. I heard that's a big no no but I think it looks quite well when I'm wearing it.
text:They certainly don't clash but I guess you can describe it as uninspiring.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Is fast fashion really fast fashion if you get years of use out of the garments?	labels:I've thought about this a lot too. I have tops that I bought at Primark for $3 seven years ago that are still in perfect condition. I think the emphasis should be on reducing consumption. There's a level of classism that comes with environmental movements as well because low income, immigrant households may not use as many "sustainable" products but they buy fewer products overall and reuse/fix everything because they have to save money.
text:Agreed! I think that is the biggest issue in the industry, the waste and the rate things are produced. It creates so much waste.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:General Discussion - December 09, 2020	labels:God the shade towards fashion students in that thread was annoying.   I don’t mind if people didn’t like what Burberry did, but why shade fashion students **in a fashion sub**??   Do they not realize these people are working to be the same people that designed clothes that ultimately trickled to the blandness they wear?   Not only does it reek of typical tech-bro toxicity, but so reminiscent of Andy in that Devil Wears Prada scene about the cerulean blue sweater.

Granted, I'm 5'11" 180#, so the size of an average dude. I wear a size 12 in women's pants.   "Unisex" in t-shirts really means men's, so you can start there on sizes. With your build, you might have to fix sleeves and pants lengths to be shorter. For pants, I think it depends on how your hips are shaped and the cut of the pants. If you have wide hips and/or a bigger butt compared to your waist, go with that measurement. If you're more straight through the waist and hips, you have some leeway.	episode_done:True

I can fit all of it now, and I'm two weeks from completing my weight loss. Thank god. A crop top turned out to not have a gap when wearing high-waisted stuff, a regular pair of jeans turned out fo be high-waisted, and so on. I didn't know I'd get so much smaller from losing weight (I sometimes think progress pics of people online are lying? Idk, I'm skeptical after estimating what I'd look like from other's pics, and turning out to be completely wrong).  I already have next month's purchases planned out haha! I'm gonna focus on buying red, yellow, green, leather shorts and some pretty jewelry.  Covid has been a time of deep depression and deeply positive lifestyle changes. Lots of good, lots of bad. I learned to style myself in a more bold way, cured a lifelong binge eating disorder, worked out daily, transitioned into vegetarianism, and I look so much better for so many reasons, I got into interior design and remade my living space completely - and I sank into a deep depression during July and missed an important exam, that I'll have to take next year, and I feel so, so lonely at times.   I want this to be over, but never have I ever improved so much within a year. I found out so many things about me that made me uncomfortable, when I was alone by myself, that I had just pushed away by being overtly active or distracted in other ways. And fashion and design-wise, I just feel like I'm surrounded by so much beauty that I marvel at every day, because everything used to look like crap. Materialism can be great is the lesson haha!

An aesthetic representation of today’s qualities. Which I think will be very simple and somber in style. Likely practical, and high quality.  I can’t and in 5 years the Pluto in Aquarius generation will pop up and they will likely be now/cyber hippies styles and maybe some funky business casual stuff.  🔮🔮🔮	episode_done:True

Doc Martens are one of my winter staples too, very boring 😆. If it's particularly cold I wear leggings under my jeans or pants, but I don't need to do that often, rain is more of a problem than cold even in winter.

text:How do you shop at TJ Maxx/Marshall’s?	labels:This is my time to shine!  Background info: I currently work for Marshalls as a front end coordinator, and I have a resale side hustle through Poshmark.  Basically 95% of finding high quality designer pieces is being there before someone else finds them. There's typically three types of merchandise: made-for-outlet, buyouts, and assorted lots.   I wanna say roughly 75% of what we stock in apparel is made-for-outlet, as in, stuff that's made specifically to be sold at Marshalls, TJ Maxx, etc. It's brands that aren't exactly household names, for example Rose + Olive, or Jack & Delancey. These typically make up the fluff of the racks, and are priced to be similar to, but juuust slightly lower than, other brands' prices. A gray Tommy Hilfiger sweatshirt might cost $24.99, while a Jack & Delancey one might be $16.99. Generally these are okay, decent quality, but tend to last maybe a year. (one of my managers bought a sweater that she only wore like 3 times and it had snagged, gotten a hold and pilled up really badly)  The next one is the buyouts. There's a little bit of overlap here with the made-for-outlet pieces, because some big-name brands have licensing agreements with our parent company (if you look at certain Anne Klein or Tahari care tags, you'll see a "TJX Europe" tag). When you see a bunch of the same item on a rack, in a bunch of different sizes, and it's a household name, for example a Calvin Klein dress, that's most likely overstock that a company like Macy's stopped selling for any number of reasons (wasn't selling well, got too low on clearance, only certain sizes sold well). Generally these are priced according to their MSRP, as they were sold in bulk according to style numbers. These can sometimes be a good deal, especially if they go on clearance. If you have Google Lens or a similar scanner app, scan the brand's barcode (not the TJ/Marshalls tag). It might pop up with a place to buy a size you need at a different retailer at a similar, sometimes cheaper but most often more expensive price.  The last section of merchandise is the assorted lots. It's technically a subset of the buyouts, but deserves its own section. This is where I personally find the best deals. I don't know for sure how the magic happens behind the scenes, but anytime you see an item with the brand crossed out, generally it was part of a massive buyout that was grouped into similar items (for example, American Eagle jackets/coats for $24.99). There are other forms of assorted lots like Irregulars (Levi's comes to mind), but my favorite thing to see is when any of my local stores get in a shipment of one-off shoes, belts, bags, etc. If they're putting merchandise out, I look for those unique pieces in the rack. Sometimes I sneak to my own store's stock room to check the new merchandise racks before they go out to the floor so I know what to look for the next day.  My most favorite recent finds have been a bunch of different Zara bags that TJ Maxx locations in my area have gotten in for $9.99. One major score was a Peter Millar men's lamb leather jacket for $39.99 that retailed for $845.   If you're looking for steals of deals, try to look at other brands some sites sell. I've found certain Free People collaboration pieces and other items sold through Free People's site as part of those assorted lot buyouts - the biggest one was a $535 dress for $29.99. I've seen Anthropologie brands, J. Crew in-house brands like Point Sur, and Urban Outfitters collab pieces like with Fila. They generally won't have their original tags on them, but you might get lucky and find a little info or brand tag.  If you hear of a brand declaring bankruptcy, there's a good chance some of it will show up at our stores. J. Crew's bankruptcy over the summer definitely was noticeable with the $5.99 blouses, jeans, even blazers, all with J. Crew tags and marked out labels. Some Madewell pieces ended up in the mix too.  One more thing to note, Marshalls/TJ tend to get types of merchandise based on the location's demographic. If you're in a really wealthy, suburban area, you'll likely find pieces that are targeted towards the people who take vacations, go on cruises, etc. If you're in a metropolitan area like NYC, you'll get the luxury bags, the Runway styles, and higher end overstock with some made-for-outlet stuff mixed in. If you're in basically the middle of nowhere, you might still get a surprise here and there, but you'll most likely get the basics and a higher proportion of fluff pieces.  My final little notice: we can't order anything ourselves, and we never know what we will get on our shipments ahead of time. Right now for the holidays, my store is getting trucks in every day. Thankfully we have a crew that works diligently and gets merchandise out to the sales floor quickly; other stores in my area aren't as fast, and get backed up.   Tips and TL;DR: Know what brands are worth their name. Crossed off brands are likely the best deals. Look for the one-offs, the oddballs and the unique pieces. Go early and go often. If you notice one TJ getting in a bunch of shoe brands you like, check the other TJs in your area. Also check out the online stores, there can be treasure on there.
text:Oh my god thank you. This is everything I was looking for.	labels:Another tip that comes in handy when you're actually in the store: look at the textures and fabrics of the made-for-outlet pieces, and then kinda quickly skim through the racks. You'll start to notice things that stick out. Jeans are an easy one to start practicing with: notice certain distressing, washes, and how often they appear on the rack. Kinda look in between too: right now we have a TON of regular blue denim in, but we've gotten in a couple pairs of gray and black ZARA jeans that definitely stand out against the sea of blue. We don't have a skirt section for the season, so I also look for those mixed in with pants/jeans.   I have a tonnnnn more little info tidbits, like if you see a tag with a highlighted top number, it's an online return. Feel free to message me if you have any specific questions, I'll do my best to answer!  One last little thing I find funny because I do shop Burlington too, there's a bunch of parallel brands between stores (Burlington gets Mango, TJ/Marshalls get Zara; Burlington gets Sorel, TJ gets North Face; Burlington gets Express, TJ gets GAP).	episode_done:True

Just be aware that, as your image illustrates, one that's tighter around the neck will accentuate the size of your neck - which you can use to make a thin neck look bigger, or a big neck look bigger.

It was made of a tiny, all over print on beige chiffon of Japanese women doing tea ceremonies. It was either made in the 70s or 80s. I’ve searched everywhere online using every kind of semi-related keyword I could come up with for the past five years. I can’t even find the fabric, or a similar one to make my own. It’s not a spill, but it’s my biggest fashion tragedy that the dress is gone forever.

text:Dress Sneakers Are Alarmingly Popular	labels:My take is we are well over a decade into the Boom of sneaker culture and the dominance of the maximal sneaker sole as the casual status symbol. At first a lot of people hated all of the large sneaker soles. In ten years those same naysayers who now walk around in the newest Jordans because they are totally normalised will be wearing dress sneakers for the same reason.   Anyone who doesn't see how thick sneaker soles would trickle up into more formal wear despite how ostensibly high end their marketing is kind of missing the fashion process in action. The suit and sneaker has been walking down the runway and the red carpet for long enough now that seeing it trickle into real wear is expected and part of the positive trend of generally more flexible and expressive clothing norms.  Edit: I will say that there is a very big divide between the white contrast sole and the black rubber sole. The white sole is more in line with the sneaker as a design element creeping in as I said, whereas the black sole dress sneaker is more in the line of the casual sneaker.	episode_done:True

text:To be a little more serious - decide what you're going to wear and ask specific questions here. And look at the FAQs in the sidebar.

From the interviews I've been in as interviewee or assistant to the interviewer, the decision depends 95% on how the person fits into the company culture (young and driving or conservative, family or very flexible, outgoing or more silent, woman or man - even if it's not the official reason, etc...); people lacking any skills or certificates or anything else needed will not be invited anyway.	labels:The main things that I want to are:  If I do happen to go with the suit, what are the best colours to go with?

text:Discussion: LGBTQIA+ Signaling, Presentation, and Commodification in Fashion	labels:I think the question of what role the media has in stereotypes of LGBTQIA fashion is interesting. From the lesbian/WLW perspective, I feel like the majority of WLW depicted in contemporary media skew far more feminine than the majority of WLW I know in real life. And for what it's worth, I don't think that's 100% about the fashion, exactly? I think there's a #vibe that many WLW have in person that doesn't translate to our on-screen depictions, particularly when the actor is presumably straight. A *lot* of bi and lesbian women I know who do dress in a very feminine way kind of offset that in some other way - a style of walking (there's a lesbian walk, I *swear*), interacting with the world, idk.  I was going to say that I don't feel pressure to dress a certain way, but I think I do sometimes and I just ignore it. The style of dress doesn't come from media or a desire to signal, it comes from my city's stereotypical "queer fashion" that has just blended into broader alternative fashion (not emo etc., just... not normie). Part of the reason I don't dress like that is that I literally do not think it would look good on my body. The other part, I think, is that I do gain a lot of benefits from moving through the world dressed in a way that has plausible deniability regarding my sexuality. Other WLW are more likely to pick up on other signals (aforementioned ways of existing in the world), but I *like* being able to choose who I do and do not tell. I think I feel more pressure to be the "blatantly gay, take it or leave it" type of WLW, and the fashion folds into that. (And I want to make it clear that in this context I'm not talking about dressing in a masc or butch way, because I have butch friends who dress entirely differently than the local subculture/community I was talking about.)  Edit: Editing to say that one signal I don't personally use but will always love is the carabiner of keys hooked to the belt loop. Chef's kiss.
text:I’m totally oblivious to the non-feminine queer “vibe,” but I know it exists because apparently it oozes out my pores. I (hourglass shaped cis gal) have unironically been called sir... while wearing a form-fitting dress with long hair. More than one person has told me I “walk like a man.”  Unfortunately I’m not actually gay/bi. I’m asexual. And while I don’t exactly mind being the butchest lesbian that ever wasn’t, it’d be nice if I could find a way to signal “ace” instead of “gay” because erasure is a shitty feeling. Mostly I just dress in a way that’s practical and comfortable and don’t worry about how I present to people, but I also realize that’s a luxury many people don’t have.	labels:I am the same, the only real ace fashion I know of is the agender aro/ace stereotype, who dress mostly androgenous and is not the best rep.  As a woman with a curvy body that androgenous look just doesn't fit me, besides, I'm not non-binary so I dont have an interest in signalling that.   However my fashion does look queer I hope, I try with following bi/lesbian trends. But I find that dressing feminine always has people assume you are sexual because feminine is sexy (or it is on a curvy body at least).   Idk where this was going anymore, I really wish there was a more ace kind of signifyer in fashion besides the ace ring. But for now Ill just stick with bi trends and whatever I find comfy :)	episode_done:True
text:How do I feel sexy at home in winter?	labels:Robes! I have about 10-12 robes of every persuasion and they always make me feel luxurious and sexy for every temperature. For example, I've got a [men's flannel plaid robe](https://www.amazon.com/Alexander-Del-Rossa-Lightweight-A0707P23MD/dp/B01N7WHY6E) that always makes me feel like I had to throw my lover's dressing gown on to grab room service. Or a [cream silk robe](https://cdn.naploungewear.com/product/cool-silk-robe-ivory/) that, paired with a velvet hairwrap and a martini, make me feel like a 40's film star about to murder her rival. Or a giant [plush cheetah print robe](https://www.nordstrom.com/s/natori-plush-cheetah-robe/5731933) that screams mid 2000's divorcee about to have a breakdown at her chalet.  As others have said, nothing is hotter than matching underwear or matching PJs. Pair it with a robe you are on your way to Sexy Time, Population: You.
text:Thanks for sharing! I'm really digging the shape, sheen, and drape of the silky cream robe! Question, how well has it worn for you ? Ie how is it with general day to day wear and tear?   And the cheetah print is fun as hell.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Is fast fashion really fast fashion if you get years of use out of the garments?	labels:I've thought about this a lot too. I have tops that I bought at Primark for $3 seven years ago that are still in perfect condition. I think the emphasis should be on reducing consumption. There's a level of classism that comes with environmental movements as well because low income, immigrant households may not use as many "sustainable" products but they buy fewer products overall and reuse/fix everything because they have to save money.
text:The classism raises such a good point and also works for low-income consumption. I remember seeing a post on Reddit about buying a good pair of shoes in relation to spending. For wealthier people, they can spend £40 on a pair of quality shoes that will last them for years. But those without much disposable income won’t be able to save up that amount of money, and will have to spend £10 for a poor quality pair of shoes that they have to replace far more often. In the end, the wealthier folks would’ve spent less money because their shoes - whilst pricier - would’ve lasted for much longer.	labels:This is from a book!  It's from "Men At Arms" by Terry Prachett.   “The reason that the rich were so rich, Vimes reasoned, was because they managed to spend less money.  Take boots, for example. He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles.  But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that'd still be keeping his feet dry in ten years' time, while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.  This was the Captain Samuel Vimes 'Boots' theory of socioeconomic unfairness.”	episode_done:True
text:Jeans: Recommendations and Reviews	labels:Honestly I think you have to give way more detail on your old pair and what you’re looking for.  In my mind the biggest hurdle to perfect jeans is the fit, and since every body is different this is highly individual. Some people might prefer stretchier denim for a more forgiving fit, while others look for stiffer fabric, and have less leeway.   Personally I still struggle to find a high rise, non cropped, fits my thighs and waist, plain dark wash, straight/skinny, 90% or more cotton, pair of jeans. But hopefully I’ll find it eventually!
text:My jeans criteria are similar. I wear men's APCs.	labels:If you don't mind sharing, how do you wash the APCs? I just got a women's standard 100% cotton which I think is the same material as men's. They are still in the break in stage (wore them 3-4 times), so I'm not sure when to start washing them, and the reviews from women are on the more stretchy ones.	episode_done:True

Also, I would say crew neck blouses and graphic t shirts. Generally a good flannel with a crew neck is a nice casual go to. :)	episode_done:True
text:Better With Age: 10 Things Better Bought Used – Put This On	labels:My mom once found a classic old bottega veneta bag in a thrift store in santa barbara.  Sold it for a thousand dollars.  I think thrift stores are not equal.  If you are lazy and just go where it is nearest to you then you will find clothes similar to your income bracket.  If you want to score big, you need to go to wealthy neighborhoods thirft shops.    Having said this,the time/ cost ratio of thrifting is not worth it in my opinion unless you have a lot of time to spare.  It is very random and if you are not in the size that is frequent then it is hoghly unlikely

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 25, 2020	labels:People I need SERIOUS help! I’m walking around in diesel zanity bootcut jeans. But I really want to drop the bootcut.   I’m trying to find a few pairs of new jeans but I’m having no luck at all.   I’m looking for slim but not skinny. I like a bit of room.  I popped into my local shop and tried on a pair of EDWIN ED 85s. They fitted really nice but the waist was a bit big. I’m waist 33 the pair I tired on was waist 34. So I popped into the EDWIN web site and ordered the very pair I tried on in the shop then another 2 pairs of the same but slightly different colours all in the same range in waist 33. I was horrified when they arrived! Honesty they were nothing like the pictures of the model wearing them! They were almost like skinny jeans?!?? I sent them back.   I then looked at the Levi’s 511. The pictures looked amazing, nice slim fit but plenty of room. I looked at loads of pictures of google and they looked great. I ordered a pair. Same as before they were almost like skinny jeans?? I’m not a big lad, I’ve got a waist 33 and normal legs. It’s like the Jean I look at look nothing like the pictures! I sent them back to.   I’ve now ordered a pair of rag and bone jean in fit 2. Hopefully they will be as described or look like the photos.  Can anyone suggest a decent brand of jeans that our slim but plenty of room?  This is the look in trying to get.

text:Who else has sensory issues that has figured out ways to not dress boring?	labels:ADHD pal here. I have also fallen prey to the "it was fine when I tried it on, but now I'm at the office and it is torture" paradigm. I have had to force myself not to compromise and to trust my gut, first off. If it doesn't feel good between my fingers, it doesn't even make it to the fitting room.   When I find something that works for me, I buy up as many as I can in different patterns and colors. This goes for jeans, trousers, tops, etc. - I own like 7 St. John's Bay long-sleeved mock necks because I KNOW I can always depend on them in the fall and winter. I also really like a specific cut of Banana Republic pants. Poshmark is great for this, but I also just keep an eye out whenever I stop into a thrift store. I know that I prefer soft, drapey fabrics, tops with looser midsections (none of those wide-banded bubble top things), and high-waisted pants (just as a few examples). It has taken a while to be able to consciously name and identify those qualities, but now that I have, shopping is getting easier and more successful.   Learning a few quick hand-sewing alteration skills is also helpful. I can choose a top a size too large and then take it in where needed so that it still fits and flatters but doesn't restrict where it would cause discomfort, or I can do the same with a pair of pants (I often size up and then take in the waistband).  I think it's just a lot of trial and error plus not being afraid to develop a uniform of key foundational pieces that you know you can depend on building an outfit/wardrobe around. Accessories can also go a long way toward breaking up the superhero/cartoon character monotony - belts, scarves, earrings, necklaces, headbands, hats, etc. can all really change up a look (depending on which of those do or don't work for you and your sensitivities).
text:You are describing it perfectly. It feels fine at the clothing store probably because I'm so excited about how it looks and the atmosphere of the store. I avoid malls like the plague for this reason. Then I go to sit down for a long period in the office and I'm realizing how weird and sweaty the fabric makes me in certain parts on my body or the seams are rubbing me weird at random times in the office.   I have one pair of Aritzia pants that I love that have a stretchy band on the back. There's a sale right now, I think I'll just get a few more pairs. I used to like some stuff from Banana Republic too but the last time I went into the store, I found a lot of their shirts had poorly made seams, it made me really sad. I also used to love the JCrew that was not at the outlet but that closed down because their outlet business killed their regular retail.  My whole journey with this is the realization that ADHD can make me appear not serious because of my tendency to talk like my head is on shuffle and talk too much. Works great for my specific job, it's like a superpower. However, I do think I have a tendency to come off as a slob or not serious on occasion. I realized I need a bit of contrast in how I present myself to the world instead of just resorting to hiding. With my medications, I can actually get up and get ready without feeling overwhelmed thinking about all the steps of putting on makeup because there's no direct consequence to me not wearing makeup even though I love it.	labels:	episode_done:True

I present as cis femme, but feel as if I'm split down masc/femme internally. She/her pronouns. Gender identity has always been ??? so I don't pay much attention to it.   Conformity is definitely a huge part of my style, but I find that it happens naturally as I tend to use fashion to my advantage and fit the moment I'm in. I enjoy experimenting and being a chameleon as a part of my identity and lived experience. There was a time where I could not come out, and the ultra femme style was my power. Regardless, it seems like my style always has a sort of "edge" to it. I enjoy a bit of androgyny alongside high femme elements, this proportion is what changes. I wore mostly office clothes and streetwear in precovid times so this was very easy to achieve.  Edit for some more details because I love this thread: someone below mentioned an "offset". I especially feel this in my body language/personality/attitude, and I think that's the edge I mentioned above. Feminine BUT with an identifying detail. Feminine BUT with a more straight/sleek masculine cut. Modern office wear BUT with some grungy air to it.	episode_done:True

text:How has the quality changed over the years at some of your fav brands?	labels:I feel like Abercrombie and Fitch has turned around! I love all the dresses I've bought from them - almost all have been lined and a lot of them have pockets! I'm so pleased.
text:Interesting! I recently bought some stuff from them this summer. I think their clothes are definitely a lot cuter than they were in the past. However, the quality hasn’t been there for me. Snags on the linen jumpsuit I’ve worn once and the bodysuit snaps don’t stay snapped.	labels:Oh man, that sucks to hear! I haven't tried any of their body suits or jumpsuits (mostly stuck to dresses) but that's good to know! I'll have to keep that in mind if I make another order with them!	episode_done:True

text:Women with ADHD & Sensory Processing Disorder: I need Clothing recs!	labels:Yesss I FEEL you. I'm ADHD-PI. I've made it a rule that if I am not 100% sure it's comfortable, or the fabric is "iffy", I won't buy it/it gets purged. I won't wear it anyway.    For me, form-fitting clothing is definitely preferred but *tight* clothing is not. Eg, compression leggings/socks (holla to that sesamoid fracture) are comforting and cozy but too-tight waistbands are not.    I try to look at it as just an easy way to save money, time, and keep clutter at bay. Don't immediately love it? Don't get it. If I'm buying something brand-new, I try to go for cotton or rayon. I can't stand polyester--not in an "ew, tacky" way, but because touching it makes my skin crawl. Unfortunately, what I've found is that the soft man-made materials do that permanent pilling thing which is an issue unto itself lol     I second Uniqlo for the great textures/durability/styles, I just wish they didn't use slave labor like many other brands do (in addition to the other costs of fast fashion). Also BP. and Halogen, but I don't have many of those pieces. On the other hand, thrift stores and even resale sites like Poshmark can just be too overwhelming unless I have a specific item in mind already.  **Edit: Leggings, I recommend Zella or Girlfriend Collective. Jeans, Old Navy/Gap. Undies: Maidenform and DKNY for bras, Tomboy are my new holy grail for undies/bralette. I am also 100% on board with joggers but I just buy random ones haha, I have a pair of no-name ones from Amazon that are super comfy and a pair from Shein that are cute, sufficiently long, and a pleasant texture (don't shame me, I already feel enough guilt for buying from them lol).    I have to wear custom orthotic inserts for an indeterminate amount of time, and I already have a hard-to-find shoe size, so finding vegan options that work has kind of been a nightmare! My Asics "running" shoes have been basically the only thing I can comfortably wear all day. Hokas were too inflexible and actually ended up causing my entire body to hurt when I tried them. I have a pair of canvas Cariuma low tops that are okay for short periods of time. I'm considering getting a pair of black velvet Birdies but I have doubts about them--mainly, will my orthotics fit and will they be durable enough for everyday wear? If anyone has any vegan shoe recommendations that are quite deep but also flexible in the soles I'm all ears!

text:Learning to dress better	labels:Seems like the info in the guides would have been useful. Do you have specific questions beyond that?  As far as the hair questions, I think it matters a little bit. Hair color affects which clothing colors will be most flattering on you. Outlandish hair styles may clash with conservative attire, while conservative hair styles may clash with edgy alternative attire. But it's possible to toy with the contrast deliberately. For example, Hardcore, Teddy Boy, Lo Head and early Skinhead styles incorporated elements of "smart" (sort of business casual) attire, but recontextualized with bold hairstyles and subversive styling. Best preppy-styled guy I knew shaved his head. It's not what you expect from the clothing, but I thought that it helped him make the look his own rather than a class costume.  So I'm mostly saying don't overthink the hair thing. Hairstyle is probably more personal than clothing, so just choose a style that you like and that suits you. If it's not harmonious with your clothing then tweak something or enjoy the contrast.	episode_done:True
text:The best sweatpants — 11 pairs tested (full post in comments)	labels:Yeahhh.  I used to like Uniqlo sweatpants for years (no, I've never been interested in luxury sweatpants. Just make them comfortable.). Until I discovered Abercrombie & Fitch's "soft AF" sweatpants. Vastly softer than Uniqlo, comparably priced on sale, and just all-around more comfortable. A serious oversight to not consider those, IMO. I know some of us might find it weird to praise A&F, especially if we remember what they used to be. But current A&F is pretty different, and in a good way.

text:This comment is surprisingly based:  >While I agree that the patches on the bomber jacket, or the Naval rank insignia are extremely bad taste, I don't see an issue with military inspired clothing. Bomber jackets, peacoats, cap toe Lace-up boots all used to be strictly military items and are now pretty normal to see people wearing around. You'd be hard pressed to find a store that doesn't sell at least one of these items. Even the most basic of basics like chino pants, t shirts, and suits have military roots. These RL designs suck, but there's plenty of tasteful military clothing out there that civilians wear because it's functional, or stylish, or is no longer strictly military clothing, and there's nothing wrong with that.  And then Mr. Silva comes in with his take on it (unsurprisingly he's a literal boomer):  >It actually wouldn't be an issue if the people pushing this weren't the same people who despise the military and all who are connected with it. In the late 60s and early 70s, I put up with these people and only hit one of them (the only one who came close enough) and don't want them profiting off our gear.

text:AHHH I almost bought one of those at the beginning of the year, but faux. But I was trying it on and when I took it off, it left bits of pink "shearling" ALLLLL over my black clothes.

I still look at pictures of it sometimes, it was so pretty.	labels:Oh on mine the shearling is white/cream and the suede itself is dyed pink! Yeah that would be annoying, I wouldn't buy that either! Mine somehow manages not to shed.  I probably wouldn't have bought mine either but it was from a designer local to me who gave it to me for like 25$ after I spent an hour shooting the shit with him about his branding and social media.

text:Casual Fridays - What do you like to wear?	labels:My workplace is business casual, but we have a no jeans and no open toed shoes rule because it’s a hospital setting.

I also wear a lot of high waisted pants (my favorites are from madewell and anthropology) with a blouse tucked in and a chunky cardigan with flats. Occasionally I will wear my more business professional pants with a blouse tucked in and a waist length cardigan. I really struggled at first with incorporating my personality into my work outfits, but I feel like I’ve nailed it now.
text:Midi skirts have become my absolute favoriteee thing in the last couple of years!!! I've never tried wearing them with a sweater tucked in though - I will have to try that.

text:FAQ: What is the environmental impact of different fabrics?	labels:I think a proper answer to this question would require a research team, a lot of money, and a lot of time. Here's some top-level things I know about various fabrics/materials:  * Cotton requires a lot of water to become a fabric. Especially anything that's "washed" like non-raw denim. (See Levi's Water-less line) * Any synthetic fabrics are made from fancy plastic and release micro plastics into the water every time you wash them. Even the tees and fleeces that are made from recycled plastics. There are [bags](https://www.patagonia.com/product/guppyfriend-washing-bag/GP001.html) and filters you can buy which supposedly cut down on the amount of micro plastics that actually make it into the water supply. I can't speak at all to how effective they actually are.  * Leathers of any kind require a lot of water and various "chemicals" to tan. Vegetable tanning is generally regarded as ~~better~~ less bad than chrome tanned leathers. * The excuse that "leather is a by-product of the meat industry" is basically a dumb trick of economics and the definition of "by-product". Meat is a larger industry and is more popular than leather so cows that are raise are more or less called "angus/beef" cows instead of "leather" cows because most of the money in them comes from the meat and not the hides. Farmers still make money off of selling the hides and such. If everyone stopped eating beef overnight then leather would no longer a by-product it'd be the main product. Don't get sucked into this excuse. * Fabric treatments, in general, are "bad". Waterproofing, non-iron, etc. * Washing clothes is "bad". Similar to how the majority of the environmental footprint of combustion engine cars comes from after they're sold, a large part of the environmental footprint of clothing comes from once it reaches your house. More specifically when you wash your clothes. Lots of washers aren't high-efficiency and use a lot of water, more energy if you don't wash on cold, dryers use a ton of energy, etc.   Hopefully someone else can talk about wool. I personally know nothing about it.  This is all really surface-level takes and there's more than enough nuance to go around that I've avoided in this comment. As always, if your primary goal is to have a small environmental footprint, there's a reason the order is reduce, reuse, recycle. Buy less.
text:Wool is great in that it doesn't need to be washed often and fibres biodegrade when they are shed or at the end of the garment's life, but there are downsides.   Overgrazing by sheep can lead to loss of biodiversity and erosion as sheep will eat plants down to the root.  Goats (for cashmere) are worse than sheep as they eat roots and flowers, preventing new growth from coming back. [Exploding demand for cashmere wool is ruining Mongolia’s grasslands | Science | AAAS (sciencemag.org)](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/01/exploding-demand-cashmere-wool-ruining-mongolia-s-grasslands) Not really on the topic of environmental impact, but it is worth noting the concerns about animal welfare, especially in regards to the practice of [mulesing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mulesing) (cutting tails).   I'm from Australia, and the erosion from overgrazing is a pretty big issue. The scale which grazing happens and the low rainfall means that plant life can't recover fully between grazing periods, even when pastures are rotated. I'm not sure if the same issues exist in other areas like Europe, since the environment is quite different, and land management (and traditional practices) might be more sustainable.	labels:[Here’s an article](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2006-dec-24-adfg-cashmere24-story.html) that describes the effect of cashmere goats on CA air quality.

text:Dae get overwhelmed by fashion?	labels:What made a HUGE difference for me was slowly starting to separate what I thought was cute and trendy, and what was actually realistic for me. Like a lot of others I started with lots of pinterest browsing. I made two separate boards, one for a "capsule" wardrobe and one for a "wow thats cute". The capsule is in a color pallet that I like and fits my lifestyle (darks,neutrals, a few colors that look good on me and I'm comfortable wearing), where as the other cute board is just things I enjoy on others. There's TONS of styles out there that I adore, and might one day adopt parts of, but just because I aesthetically love and appreciate it doesn't mean it'll work for me and my lifestyle. For example, I love the super feminine, flowy light vibe. Its beautiful, looks amazing on other people, but on me it feels out of place and isn't a very good fit for me specifically. This goes on the cute board! I know I love it and can identify that now, while still realizing that its just not for me right now.   Visually splitting up /why/ I liked a look or outfit really helped me better understand what I was looking for in my own wardrobe. Maybe that could be a good starting place for you too!	episode_done:True

I did a google shopping search for a pair of Mizunos and found the ones I wanted for $30 cheaper than most retailers. I ordered it from a place called runners inn. Well it took 2 months to get here and there customer service was terrible. And when I tracked it, it was coming from the Netherlands. I kept contacting them in chat and I would always be like 70th in queue!  It was awful. When I looked them up there BBB rating was something awful. I guess I should’ve researched the company first and just stick to reputable sites. I had another order in the same time frame coming from Lithuania and it got to me in 3 days. Another site though.
text:Yeah, I've ran into them a couple of times - they consistently have the best prices for a wide range of products, and also appear to have the largest stock available - sizes you can't find anywhere else are listed as "in stock".

text:How do some people put outfits together so effortlessly. Fashionista's please help.	labels:Hi! Former stylist.  1) Pay attention to the fit of things and figure out what cuts and shapes look good on you. Paper bag pants and some joggers have similar fits. Some mini skirts and shorts hit the same place on your legs and can have the same waist height. Find your sweet spot and don’t be afraid to buy multiple things in silhouettes that work for you.   2) Get some statement pieces that you would die for. If you are wearing a pair of jeans that fit well and a t-shit purchased within the past 3 years with some awesome earrings you going to look and feel great. If you are wearing an amazing dress and simple white sneakers you are going to look and feel great. Don’t overthink things but try and wear at LEAST one piece you are excited about at a time.   3) Don’t buy things just cause they are on sale, you saw your friend wearing it, or you feel like you “need” something in your wardrobe. You should love everything in your closet in its own special way unless it’s workwear and you hate your dress code for work. Something as simple as a T-shirt has so many different factors like cut, material, neckline, sleeve length. Purchase what feels good and don’t bother with the rest.
text:For 1. What pants do you recommend for people who are thin but carry a bit more weight in the core (stomach and butt) instead of their legs and thighs.	labels:It’s hard to say. Even for people who put on weight in the core does it go “out” or “sideways”? Everybody’s body is so different. It’s hard to tell what looks good without trying on different things but usually people are a pretty good judge of what “works” once they find it! Just keep an open mind and be willing to take stuff into a dressing room. A big butt or rounded stomach/hips can be sexy! If you are looking to “hide” something however a good trick is to split it up -ie. layering or accessorizing with a belt, jacket, longer necklace etc.	episode_done:True

Who has boobs that size that naturally look like the shape formed by an underwire bra? Literally basically no one. I’m a human person. I have boobs. They don’t have to defy gravity. And I don’t have to wear some uncomfortable CONTRAPTION to fool the world into thinking they do. I fully support women who feel their best in an underwire bra. I just don’t think we have some societal obligation to optimize our boob shapes.

text:What ultimate-splurge fashion item would you buy to reward yourself for achieving a big milestone?	labels:A real leather motorcycle jacket. I plan to slurge on it when I get my first paralegal job.
text:Some notes on motorcycle jackets from someone who has put...way too much thought into them:  There's a stark difference on something that's cut *like* a motorcycle jacket and an actual motorcycle jacket.  I've got both, and they come with pros/cons in terms of styling.   For a fashion jacket that is cut to look like a motorcycle jacket, it's less bulky, integrates with a broader variety of shoes and clothing, and you have far more options for color and cut.  They can be styled much more feminine/soft.  They're also thinner leather and wear through fast, and the lighter colors are a pain to clean.    A jacket meant for riding is going to be bulkier, much heavier, and have stiffer hardware on it.  There can be reinforcement (drag panels) in the elbows, back, and shoulders, and the sleeves will be tight at the wrists so gauntlets can be pulled into place, then zipped over.  A lot of women's jackets are tight at the waist and don't look particularly pleasing when left open.  It's much more dramatic, though, and the type of coat can signify your riding style.  Both coats create different vibes.  I'll use the first type for fair weather or if paired with scarves/cowls because the coat can be left open without completely wrecking the silhouette, and I'm a fan of a longer layers underneath.  Classic moto or cafe style cuts with minimal hardware seem to work best, and it's easy to pick up multiples for the different colors, because there are oh so many colors.  The jacket is part of an integrated outfit in this case, and it's so easy to style them according to mood.    My real riding coats cannot be styled with skirts...or anything other than boots, but I feel a lot more kick ass in them, whether or not I showed up on my motorcycle.  If you're looking to create a more dramatic silhouette (tight at the waist, broader at the shoulder, bulk at the arm from the reinforcement), these can look pretty cool and make you look tougher.  If you want to be splashy, look into track jackets from the 80s and 90s (they'll be leather versus textile) or the heavier classic cut styles with a good belt at the waist.  Boots are a must, and fitted pants recommended.  In this instance, the jacket is the piece you're showing off, so everything else you're wearing is muted in contrast.  Got a jacket in mind yet?!	labels:I've been looking at biker jackets lately and had a little bit of difficulty, as it seemed there were so many different types that I got a little overwhelmed. This explains it!  I'd likely prefer something in category 1, as I don't actually ride a bike, and I'm always into more versatile items (although I wear nothing but Dr. Martens so the boots part isn't a problem for me hah). Thanks for this - now I know what to look for - any recommendations for specific styles?  Edit: a word.	episode_done:True

I own a leather satchel from the Cambridge Satchel Company that I take on all of my job interviews.   Kind of expensive everyday items are my simple Dooney and Burke tote bag and my Manitoba Mukluk moccasins. I also have a pair of Doc Marten Chelsea boots that I adore. I have a lot of foot issues so I will splurge on sneakers by Brooks and use them almost everyday.

text:Athleisure has become very popular in the past few years and I’m all for it. You don’t need to be all dressed up every time you step outside, but that doesn’t mean you can’t still look good in sweats, hoodies, etc.   Especially with working from home becoming a bigger thing, why not invest more in loungewear that’s going to be more comfortable, (hopefully) last longer, or be willing to pay more for ethically-made garments? Uniqlo doesn’t have a good track record, but there are for sure companies that are ethically/environmentally conscious that make awesome pieces, sometimes they’re much more expensive but that’s up to the buyer to consider.	labels:I guess I look at it as something for other people.  Personally, I am generally not more comfortable in loungewear for every day wear. It's floppy and all over the place. It slides down and doesn't stay on right, or rides up, because it's rarely fitted properly. My normal pants always fit right and never ride up. Hoods on hoodies never sit right under  a jacket, and having that bulk at the back of your neck in a desk chair isn't very nice. I do have a few zip up sweatshirts without hoods though.  The one comprise I have made for WFH is shoes. I hate to admit it, but I go barefoot in the summer and wear some foam shoes (OK, fine, they are crocs...) in the winter. Mostly as a means to save wear on my more expensive shoes.  I do have a ton of homemade clothes for sleeping in, I suppose I could wear that during the day, but I don't find them particularly comfortable for walking around the house in.	episode_done:True

text:MFA Brand MegaReview: Drake's | January 16, 2021	labels:I should preface this review by saying that, while I've followed the brand for some time, and handled a few pieces, I only own one piece from Drake's -- a [watermelon pocket square](https://i.imgur.com/RCePbSK.jpg).  Overall, I enjoy Drake's. I like their casual, modern take on tailoring. I like the way they style their inspo albums. I like their models (Usually -- there are definitely a few corny ones). They use a lot of unique patterns. Kitschy watermelons, archers, leaves, mythical beasts... Unique patterns are cooler than paisleys and florals, especially if they're *good* unique patterns, and theirs are.  They also make straight up quality silk accessories -- ties, bowties, cummerbunds, scarves, pocket squares. I've heard somebody here arguing that they're not quite as special as they used to be, but that's less a factor of them getting worse, and more a factor of the market getting more competitive. They still make beautiful ancient madder designs, quality grenadines, and all that... And they use really high-quality silk. Their ties seem expensive, but think of them in comparison to those from Hermes and other luxury brands. They're at least as well made, and generally better-looking.  You're certainly paying a premium for their styling and curation. There's nothing inherently wrong with that if you want to do it, but you can also sometimes get the "same thing for less," if you're looking at the makers section I included elswewhere.
text:> You're certainly paying a premium for their styling and curation. >There's nothing inherently wrong with that if you want to do it, but you can also sometimes get the "same thing for less," if you're looking at the makers section I included elswewhere.  With that being said, if you like the brand, I think it's worth considering buying from Drake's rather than going straight to their suppliers.   You likely would not have heard of many of these makers or considered buying from them if Drake's didn't carry them and put them into stylistic context with their lookbooks.    Although I understand the desire to save money, I think it's a bit lame when people heap praise upon Drake's and get inspiration from their lookbooks, but then try to figure out who makes their products so they can get them for cheaper.  Support the brands you like, people!	labels:This is also why I highlighted the differences in my comment, which to me make them that bit more valuable.	episode_done:True
text:What rules do you break for your body type?	labels:This is weird, because I’m skinny and runway models wear all types of clothes while being even skinnier than me and look good in it. I’m small, but I guess not like runway model beautiful skinny small, especially since I’m barely over 5 feet. Im petite and have very little curve to me (24 in waist, 36 in hips type shit). I’ve been told I look like a little boy when I wear tight clothes and that really stuck with me. I always felt undeserving of wearing tight/sexy clothes and sometimes I still do because I don’t look like a fashion nova model. On Instagram if I see a girl like me wearing tight clothes it’s usually filled with men saying “she has no ass.” “She looks like a kid.” As ive gotten older I’ve gotten a more fuck it attitude and wear a lot of tight dresses that I like and think I look good in regardless of what other people might think.   I understand that I’m skinny and I def don’t have the same experiences as other people who are bigger than me but even those small offhand comments really altered how I viewed my body. I hate that people feel like it’s okay to comment on other people’s bodies and try to dictate what they can wear!
text:I'm (likely) a lot older than you are and I recently saw someone commenting on how to pose to make your butt look bigger, and I'm like...WHY. That would have been an appalling idea when I was 20.  Just to say, I've seen many body types go in and out of fashion, which is pretty weird in itself, so don't let comments like that, or whatever model body type is hyped up at the moment, get you down.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Has anyone else ever tried on a designer item just to see what the hype is about?	labels:Not an answer to your question but another one of my infamous vaguely related anecdotes.   I was born and raised in the really shitty outskirts of Paris, and when I was in high school, my friends and I would dress up our very best and fanciest all-Primark outfits, take the métro to Paris and try on all of the high end stuff in the Gallerie Lafayette. We’d make a whole day out of it and make up a new story for every store. A classic was "I’m looking for a dress for my sister’s wedding. It will be in the château de Vallery". When we were tired of trying on all of the beautiful and outrageous stuff, we’d leave pretending we didn’t buy anything because something was wrong with the things we tried on rather than the fact that we were piss poor rats from the hood.
text:That sounds like my kind of fun! I wish I had friends to go with, most of my friends aren't as into clothes or fashion as I am.	labels:It is very fun! Still offer the idea, sometimes pretending to be rich is just as fun as the clothes. Some store would offer food and drinks.	episode_done:True

text:Yeah for me personally bombers like the one in your link are perfect for 10-16c weather, which is pretty much what they mean by intermediate.

text:Women who have revamped your entire wardrobe — how did that go? What is your advice for the rest of us?	labels:I looked for influencers who had a similar body shape and coloring to me and whose style I liked. If something looks good on them, I know it’ll probably look good on me! I also had saved up looks on Pinterest over a few years and tried to find similarities between the looks. Using a recommended items for a capsule wardrobe list, I added and subtracted things based on what I needed to fill out my wardrobe to a basic level and what was extra.  From there, I tried to keep track of brands that I knew I liked and I look out for their annual sales or look for their items on second hand sites like the RealReal. It’s taken me awhile (~2 years ish and still working on it), and at the beginning I bought cheaper pieces to hold me over. I do regret that a bit, the fit was never right and the fabric didn’t do me any favors. I used a lot of spreadsheets and inspiration boards (mainly a tool called Coda which combines docs and sheets) to keep track of exactly the type of pieces I was looking for.	episode_done:True
text:PSA: Revive by Rent the Runway via Thredup	labels:I've had luck on ThredUP, but I also don't purchase anything over $20/30, only buy during a sale or with a solid % off code, or I look for the truly funky vintage goodies that wind up there for cheap.   I've never used RTR, but when I saw the ad for Revive on my thredup app I was curious. I was honestly shocked when I saw a sweater (which I'm sure was a nice enough when it was new) with a MASSIVE stain on the front of it for more than $60! It absolutely was not a part of the design on this otherwise solid colored sweater. Goodwill wouldn't even sell something with a big, dark, nasty stain like that. Really made me worry about what the other Revive items could be hiding in less obvious places... Ick.
text:How do you find funky vintage goodies? That's what I want more of but I didn't have much luck on ThredUp.	labels:I've had luck by looking at the "unbranded" or "assorted brands" tags, that's what they seem to sort old, unknown brands into - there's also a lot of low quality junk, but if you know what you're looking for you can usually visually scan pretty quickly. I also always check the boxes for natural fibers (cotton/linen/silk/wool) and check the fabric content on the actual items. As an example, I love funky vintage holiday vests, and I can usually find some fun ones using those filters.  ETA: And just as an example of what I think of as a fun find, I used the unbranded/assorted/natural fiber search method and found this super funky 100% silk teal/gold embroidered jacket, item #82827451.	episode_done:True

Inside: I have my small wallet. Essentials punch with neosporin, bandaid, hand sanitizers, extra gloves, extra masks, some meds. Tiger balm, salonpas, hair ties, pads, wipes. A diaper. A beanie with a puff. Tea bags, instant coffee packets, sugar packets, mayo and mustard packets. Soy sauce. Chopsticks, spoons, and forks. Various random snacks. Electrolytes drink mix packets. My makeup bag. A note pad, random pens. Phone charger cord and battery charger. Glasses case...  That's what I see so far. I carry alot.  If I am carrying light. I have a Coach Cassie Crossbody bag that I carry for going out.	episode_done:True
text:What are your favorite bags at the moment?	labels:I've been into Tom Bihn bags lately. The Café Bags are my go-to most of the time. For backpacks, I have two Daylite Backpacks which are surprisingly roomy while looking pretty sleek. I also have a Sidekick and an Everyday Cubelet for if I just need a smaller purse to carry my wallet and phone around.  They aren't super elegant but they can hold a surprising number of stuff, and they have a good system going with o-rings you can attach stuff to. :) It's just a shame shipping is so much when you live in Europe!	episode_done:True
text:Handbag conundrum: lesser know (and lesser seen all over the place) or standard luxury designer bags (think the usual Gucci, YSL, LV, etc.)	labels:Echoing what a lot of people have been saying, I feel like sometimes with luxury brands you really are just paying for the name. Yes, some do last but on many occasions they don’t. I don’t believe it’s necessarily worth it. I know many people who spend thousands of dollars on Hermes bags, which is something they love and makes them happy and that makes me happy! However, I myself could never justify it, even though I can afford it. I have found myself trying really hard to find some smaller brands, and I think their designs are to die for and the quality is just amazing. I would highly suggest Polene if you haven’t seen it already! I just bought a purse from them, and it is by far my favorite bag.   It’s just important to approach fashion as what it means to you. Everyone here has their own personal relationship with fashion, and by all means, if you absolutely love a piece, go for it :) at the end of the day, you’ll be the one wearing it!	episode_done:True
text:How to Dress for Life at Home	labels:So... I agree with the premise that I don't want to baby my clothes. Especially with the stuff I wear around the house... I want to wear it until it stinks, maybe a few days more, then dump it into the washer and dryer on the same settings I'm using for everything else.  And I like the idea that soft clothing is overrated... Buuuut the idea that "hard clothing" is better for your soul... That isn't any better. I'm not asking for chemically softened sweatpants and fleece, but I'm also not wearing denim and workwear around the house.  The perfect around-the-house pant would be cheap, soft, easy to care for... but also not sweatpants, if you want to avoid feeling like you just rolled out of bed, right?  Maybe cheap machine washable drawstring cotton cords. I have a used hawick cashmere sweate... it's got holes, but it still makes me feel presentable.  I'd totally wear those informale/chadprom linen trousers *everywhere* in the summer if they weren't so crazy expensive. Linen and rayon embody great sleep vibes, they're the right kind of comfortable for the summer.
text:Linen is the way to go  Soft, comfy, hardwearing, washed on a 'normal' cycle	labels:Yeah, but not really right for winter, and usually not cheap.	episode_done:True
text:How do you actually incorporate colour in your wardrobe?	labels:My rule of thumb when adding any interesting/statement elements to an outfit is to just add on piece of each statement type to an otherwise neutral outfit.  This isn't just for color, but also jewlery and theme pieces.   For example I love western wear because I grew up in the midwest, but if I were to wear boots, a big belt buckle, a chambray shirt, and a jean jacket all together it would look a little costume-y. But maybe I just wear boots with a midi-length skirt and blouse or a big belt buckle with jeans and a t-shirt, now they look more like elements of a whole look rather than being a look themselves.  So for color I'd start small, find a couple of colors you like and start adding ONE element of color to an outfit. Something like an electric blue top, some chunky red earrings, or maybe a bright green skirt, and then make everything else your normal neutral look.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 11, 2020	labels:Hey MFA! Female here. I'm beginning my Christmas shopping for my boyfriend and this year I'm looking to find him a nice woolen sweater, quarterzip, turtleneck, something of the like. So 2 questions:  1) Where do you guys do your shopping? Most of my favorite brands are for women. Are there any holy grail knit brands for men that I should be aware of? [This](https://www.johnstonsofelgin.com/us/chocolate-brown-marl-mens-cashmere-jumper-lars.html) is kind of an ideal turtleneck for him, but yikes that price. I'd be willing to spend a bit on this sweater (for 100% wool) but not quite that much...   2) Sizing! He is tall (6' 5") but skinny as a stick and I am completely oblivious to male sizing. I would ask him for measurements but a) I don't want to reveal my christmas scheming and b) this man is clueless haha. Any insight on whether he would be a large or extra large? His height leads me to think he would be an extra large but would that make these clothes extremely baggy?   Thank you!!
text:Definitely look into tall size if you end up going with a brand that has it. I'm three inches shorter but also very skinny and if he's similar to me in that regard I don't know that he'd be an XL unless he has a large torso. I wear a small in some brands! The tall sizes are a few inches longer but would be cut thinner in the chest. With that said, knitwear can also look good a bit larger, and I love a cozy sweater.  Your best bet is to measure his existing clothes if that's possible, or to just ask what size he usually wears.	labels:	episode_done:True

Fixate your mindset on doing what’s best for you & what will make you feel confident. If you want to try something new, do it! If you’re uncomfortable because you’re picking wedgies the whole time, adjusting things, then you’ll know it wasn’t for you. Honor yourself & your body. You know what’s best for you! There’s very few things that would fall under “right” or “wrong” fashion. It’s always evolving!	episode_done:True

text:When/why did you get your first really fancy purse/bag?	labels:It wasn't even that fancy - just a black Kate Spade bag with a light pink bow.  However, it was the first time I had been allowed in a KS store without getting shooed out in less than ten minutes. It was the first time I had been allowed to make a purchase that placed how much I liked it over its practicality.  It was the first time I had ever gotten to buy a bag for myself.  It was the first time in five years that I had been able to make a purchase without a negative comment.  I was so so excited. I couldn't shut up about how excited I was to the poor cashier in that cramped, overcrowded store. It was my first "for me" purchase of being freed from that toxic, harmful "relationship" and spreading my wings was so so glorious.  Edit because I left out that very important piece of info lol: I had just managed to escape a mentally and emotionally abusive relationship.  This was my first unshackled trip to the mall in 5 years. It was so freeing and amazing to simply go to the stores I wanted to go to, to take the time to browse as I wanted to. It's taken me a few years to work on the gaslighting, but I'm very proud to say that I've got a system that works for me.
text:I didn't realise people got shoo'd out of kate spade! I've heard of it happening at louis vuitton and maaaaybe chanel, kate spade is a new one though.

text:Messy eaters? Tell your stories and hacks / fixes.	labels:Why do extra work when you can just git gud at putting food in your mouth hole? Changing your wardrobe, carrying a bib, or changing clothes to eat is a bit silly of a solution to a problem that can be remedied by becoming less messy, no?    I'm sure that's not what anyone wants to hear, but I don't see this as markedly different than a child who has to learn to put away their toys. Messy eating isn't some genetic anomaly, you can simply exercise more control over how you eat. It may even be as simple as slowing down or leaning forward more over a table/desk.
text:I don’t think this is fair. There are a lot of people out there that have real struggles you’re not considering.   I have ADHD and I have difficulties with executive functioning. My ADHD brain sees there is food in front of me so my singular focus becomes shoveling that food down my gullet. When you start adding “distractions” like talking to my partner or unconscious distractions like filtering out restaurant noise, it’s difficult to focus on staying neat. Like many others with ADHD, I’m also clumsy without a clear cause.  Consider physical handicaps. Someone with tremors will have difficulty with spills. Same with someone in a wheelchair when a restaurant isn’t properly ADA accessible. They can dress they way they, but they might need some accommodations or they might need to employee some extra life-hacks.   I’m not trying to be dramatic or suggest you’re a bad person or anything.  Well-meaning people forget about the everyday struggles of others all the time. OP asked for practical advice for a problem they’re having. Many others, including me, reading this thread have real anxieties from the same issue.

text:Does the way you dress really have to have a label for it??	labels:No, no, no and no. I hate the aesthetic thing. Buying things bc 'they fit in with my aesthetic' and not bc you like them is weird to me. You can be all of those styles all at once.

text:That last one. Any tips on dresses for that? I love it.	labels:Oh god THE PRESSURE. Personally, I go for dresses from Zara, Pull & Bear and Topahop for that one bc they're just really cute. I'm broad in the shoulder and have a large bust so whilst I love the tiered midi dress style, I only own 2 and tend to go for more v neck dresses or rounder necklines.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 16, 2020	labels:I'm trying to find a nice warm jacket/coat to wear that will keep me comfortable below freezing and the wind doesn't cut through. It gets below 32F here (US South East) often, even down into the 20s & teens.  My clothing currently consists of blue jeans, chinos, and some high top black & white converses. Would love something I could wear with both. I've looked into bomber jackets and pea coats. Not sure what all else I should look into. I know I like fitted clothing rather than bulky. My family keeps suggesting the big canvas carhartt jackets, but they are a bit big and bulky to be wearing with chinos on my way to work.  As far as price goes, I'm not sure what decent jackets/coats (or any clothing for that matter) go for. I'd like to stay under $100 though, but would go a little more for the perfect jacket that would last me a long time.  Any advice would be very appreciated!

text:Style rut: Pinterest vs reality	labels:Boy oh boy, if the pandemic has taught me anything (it's taught me a lot of things, lol), it's that my interest in fashion goes so far beyond actually dressing myself. I still fantasize about outfits for imaginary future events and spend hours looking for the perfect items online that I (usually) don't end up buying, even though I have spent 90% of this year working from home in 8 year-old sweatpants from Dick's Sporting Goods.   Totally hear your point that you might actually want to revamp your wardrobe, and that's valid for sure. I just wanted to chime in and say that fashion can absolutely be a hobby outside of your own self presentation, which also overlaps a lot with access to what's perceived as fashionable/if your body and person is perceived as such, etc.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 23, 2020	labels:Good day lads! I own a pair of common projects achilles and I haven’t worn them for about 8 months and i haven’t worn them for more than 10 times. This is because I never really had the need to wear them since i’m mostly in the house due to the lockdown protocols. Just wanted to ask how long until the soles crumble and should i try to wear them again even if I’m just in the house?
text:The soles won't crumble unless they are being exposed to high and low temps repeatedly (think like 100+ to Below zero switches multiple times a day) there fine you don't have to wear them around the house	labels:Thanks for the input bro. Merry christmas!	episode_done:True
text:People who built your wardrobe consciously from scratch - what were your strategies?	labels:I switched jobs and the dress "code" went from frilly/preppy to casual (but no jeans). It really threw me for a loop when I started to realize that I hated everything I owned. I had accumulated things that helped me fit into my previous role but I didn't like the clothes at all. So I not only had to fit into a new work environment, but I also had to figure out what I actually liked and what made me.. feel like me (mild existential crisis anyone?)  I utilized the book "The Curated Closet" as well as the author's blog to help. It took a couple of years to honestly figure out what I liked and didn't like but I'm glad I went through the process. I donated much of what I owned and it helped me process the fact that I was trying to fit in instead of trying to be myself for a very, very long time.	episode_done:True
text:4SDesigns FW21	labels:Just FYI that a lot of the pieces fit large, for FW20 at least. I wanted to buy the navy Melton frock coat (coat in look 2 and 17) and my TTS felt like 3 sizes too big. I get it’s meant to fit oversized but I probably could’ve sized down two sizes and still have it be oversized.  I still want the look 17 fabric so hoping retailers pick up smaller sizes or the sizing gets more normalized.	episode_done:True
text:What I Like is Not What I choose to wear	labels:What I like to look at and what I like to wear are not the same thing. I actually think a lot of fashion struggles come from people not understanding how to separate what they find aesthetically interesting from what meets the specific needs in their life.  When you look at a photo of an outfit, you're not *just* reacting to the outfit itself. You're also reacting to the body of the model, the styling choices (makeup and hair), and the photography decisions (the pose, the location, the lighting).   I might look at a photo and think "that person looks so cool in that outfit," but that person isn't me. I would not look that cool in that outfit because I'm a completely different person.  When I choose clothing for myself it needs to satisfy my aesthetic tastes when paired with my body and the amount of effort I'm willing to put into styling (i.e. zero), as well as suit the needs for my daily life. That's actually a limited number of options for me.   But when I am admiring an outfit or a photo, I'm not constrained by my hang ups about my body or the needs of my daily life. I can just like the outfit without having to contextualize it around myself, which is actually quite nice.  So, personally speaking, my interest in fashion isn't limited to clothing I would choose to wear. I find it's much more freeing to allow myself to enjoy fashion and outfits without always questioning whether I would like the outfit on my own body.
text:Totally agreed, and this is why it makes me a bit squirmy when people say "wear what makes you happy!" in this sub, in the sense that it should be the last word in clothing. Yes, of course you should wear what makes you happy, but what makes us happy to wear is not so simple for a lot of people.  There are tons of things I don't particularly love in isolation but make me happy on my body, and conversely things I love in isolation but *don't* love on my body, and that can come from many angles: pure aesthetics but also fit, comfort, personal goals, how I'm treated when I'm wearing it, etc etc. What exact elements contribute to any of these is really the crux of personal fashion, and it's a far more complex conversation than just "wear it if you like it".	labels:Yeah, "wear what you like!" is an unhelpful platitude. It's the "just be happy!" of fashion advice, it doesn't tell you HOW to get where you want.	episode_done:True

text:Shitpost Saturday: You Are What You Wear	labels:I like to believe that my year round crop tops hide the fact that I’ve noticed that I’ve gained 30 pounds in the last year, while also shining a shockingly large spot light on that exact fact. It really screams “of course I love my body! Look how much I don’t care that I have to hike my jeans up every 30 seconds!”.  My insane purse collection that consists of clear plastic, Fanny packs worn across the chest and beat up designer bags from thrift stores really emphasizes that even though 30 is right around the corner I refuse to let go of my early 20s, it has a real “fellow kids” feel that tricks me into sleeping sound at night knowing at least I’m not “one of those boring 30 year olds who has accepted that death is coming for us all”.

text:What's an "outdated" item you still love and wear although the style has fallen out of fashion?	labels:I wear what I like and I’m not aware of when things go out of fashion. I fell in love with peasant blouses as a child in the ‘90s and have loved them since.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else feel that nothing is unfashionable nowadays?	labels:I distinctly remember in the late 90s my mum saying exactly the same thing. This was because she could remember growing up in the late 1970s and early 80s where silhouettes were much more restricted in terms of what was considered current. Like one year everybody would wear knee length skirts, the next year it was short skirts, then it was maxi skirts. I would probably argue that this was the case up until the 1990s when suddenly there was much more diversity in terms of women’s fashion and probably more overt referentiality to past styles than there had been previously. Fashion also became much more aesthetically fragmented. There’s like the mainstream, macro fashion trends but then also different communities and groups develop their own aesthetics and fashion language. Hence it feels like anything goes, but it doesn’t really... it’s all about signalling to the right group of people that you belong with them and the rules are constantly changing. Power and prestige exist in being able to transgress the codes enough to move aesthetics forward while still obeying the general sensibilities. As cities grow bigger there is more access to people who will have increasingly niche interests and lifestyles. Like I will not really understand subtle signifiers of status and power in the corporate sector, because this is not my domain. Similarly, a corporate person would be totally out of place in the world I work in. Unless, we lived in the same area and took our kids to the same playground, in which case there would be a particular parent-in-park set of fashion conventions we would both likely adhere to. If we went to a different area, these would likely change.  Edit: thank you for the awards kind humans of Reddit!
text:Your comment is interesting.  I definitely think the internet has allowed fashion to become more diverse, would you say that's the main reason there was a shift in the 90s?	labels:This is complex and there’s many things to say about this cultural shift. I can’t possibly give a satisfying answer in a post... One way to think about it is the fact that fashion trends have historically trickled down (unlike the accumulation of capital). The people with the most cultural and economic capital have dictated trends. Globally, France decided it would be the empire of fashion. Vogue was founded to dictate fashion trends set in France to the USA. Through the 20tg century these trends then filtered through the different strata of markets. Of course, there were always niche groups that did their own thing, however, general populations just wanted to keep up with the basic principles of fashion. In the 1990s, more young people in the west became increasingly apathetic towards the social climbing that had been such a preoccupation previously. The recession helped this along. As did the increasing popularity of magazines that catered towards ‘alternative’ cultures. Suddenly, you could be a young kid in the suburbs but have access to what the most interesting/ challenging fashions/ music/ art was being produced. The interesting thing that happened was that suddenly irony, humour, irreverence and sarcasm began to enter into popular fashion choices. You can thing of the iconic 90s look here of 40s style floral dresses paired with combat boots. This idea didn’t come from those with economic capital, but those with cultural capital. I should put a disclaimer here that this is a generalisation. While it is true that non-conformity became popularised, those most able to stylishly non-conform were those with inherited economic capital. In short, in the 1990s, non-conformity and performances of individuality became increasingly popularised, paving the way for the complexities of how we dress today.	episode_done:True

My favorite types of features are the "what's in my closet" types, [Coveteur has a great one](https://coveteur.com/closet/)! I also scan Who What Wear and the Zoe Report to see what's new and happening on the trend side.   I have a few bloggers/influencers I follow on instagram, but honestly my feed does a terrible job displaying it with the algorithm.   I like to see stuff in real life, so I do a lot of people watching (though not now), particularly at places where I think there may be interesting style. I am a member of a couple of museums, and the exhibit opening parties are great for this. I also like to walk around the fancy department stores and check out their displays - in the windows, in the sections that are way out of my budget. I like to see how these things are merchandised for more ideas.   And lastly, I follow or get on the email list for any brand I remeotely like the aesthetic for. I love that more and more brands are featuring their customers in their materials, whether it is a blog post, on their instagram, or even in the email newsletter. Most have a "women we like feature" that talks about their life and style. These also help to give me ideas that are baked in real life. So there you have it, that is most of my inspiration.  I am in my early 40s, I like to scope out my younger cousins and other relative's instagrams to see what the kids are up to and what they are wearing. Just for FYI!  It may not be my style, but it gives me a window into life outside of mine!	labels:Thank you for those suggestions! I’ll definitely try the ones I’m able to. I don’t live in the most fashion forward city.. there a lot of rhinestones and crosses here.	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 19, 2021	labels:I'm trying to upgrade my wardrobe with slightly higher quality pieces that don't pill or shirts that crack as much over time, with nice and soft material- what materials should I be looking at or staying away? Trying to stay under $100 generally- $150 max. I live in a generally hot climate all year round, although at work I do wear hoodies because the office is consistently \~65F. I guess the style I'm looking for is more towards streetwear? I very much like minimalist looks too.  I've been looking into some quality jewelry- is Etsy stainless steel worth it or should I go ahead and just get better quality jewelry? Stuff that doesn't get green or look very worn over time. Found some stuff on [https://www.vitalydesign.com/](https://www.vitalydesign.com/) that I really like, but don't really know anything about jewelry or any cool sites to look at.

text:My Gucci Addiction: Vanity Fair editor Buzz Bissinger's essay about spending $638k on clothes	labels:It's crazy to me how he was willing to spend so much money on quality pieces that weren't really ultimately that flattering on him (aside from the anarchy studded leather jacket and the shirt he was wearing with it).    That blue leather jacket was particularly boxy and dated looking IMHO.  A lot of the boots were nice but not for his age/body type.  I dunno. Maybe I'm just an asshole but it all came off as very attention hungry and mid life crisis-y. I feel like he looks like if Dave Navarro from The Red Hot Chili Peppers aged 20 years and became bloated? I do like the maroon lip but not on him.
text:You're entitled to your opinion, but I do think it's more mean-spirited than perhaps you wish it was. This guy is a joke to me too, but that has to do with unsavoury aspects of his *personality* which shone through the essay, not the way he looked in the clothes. I came away from this article with a resounding "this dude sucks", but I actually think he looked fierce; a sci-fi figure in a less judgmental, less binary future. I am not saying he justified the 600k at all(!)—but I do wish more avant-garde style choices were accessible to more people. Seeing the fact that he's an older guy who isn't sample size being a reason it was an ESPECIALLY bad move (not just your comment, either) makes me feel a bit sad.  My personal sartorial heroes are the older folks captured on the Advanced Style blog, where the relationship to fashion and age/body is challenged and the "models" all come from very different economic backgrounds.  Anyway, this wasn't meant as some kind of counterattack, just expressing another view of things.	labels:Seconded! I like it when people get a little (or a lot) outrageous with their clothes.

Thank you so much, you’re doing an amazing job in making the internet a better place.  Other than that, do you know mechanisms that actively counter those impulse shopping sessions?
text:Thank you for taking the time to read! Generally, start training your self-control (e.g. exercises like stroop task, keeping a diary, doing physical exercise). Also try to stay rested as much as possible as fatigue reduces self-control.  For more specific tips, there are 3 that I like:  1.	⁠The 24-hour rule. Wait for 24 hours after seeing the item before buying it. Helps you to escape the impulse & shopping momentum - mostly you’ll forget about the ite or decide that’s you don’t want/need it. 2.	⁠Match outfits before buying. When you see an item, think of 3, 4, or 5 items this new one would go with in your wardrobe. If you can’t find them, don’t buy. Helps to avoid getting stuff that ends up collecting dust in the closet. 3.	⁠Think of similar items in your wardrobe. Then consider whether this new thing will add anything new and fill a missing spot in your wardrobe.  These 3 specific tips are adopted from a video by blogger Lydia Elise Millen.  They all still somewhat rely on self-control though, so there’s no perfect way. Hope it helps!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:There is no unmarked woman	labels:This reminds me, tangentially, of John Berger on the male gaze from Ways of Seeing (book and 4 part video series on art and also advertizing). I was riveted by the idea of constantly being aware of being looked at - here in the quote, by men but also by other women, too, I think:   “One might simplify this by saying: men act and women appear. Men look at women. Women watch themselves being looked at. This determines not only most relations between men and women but also the relation of women to themselves. The surveyor of woman in herself is male: the surveyed female. Thus she turns herself into an object - and most particularly an object of vision: a sight.”
text:There was a Dakota Bardy [comic](https://i.redd.it/76wlet9bylc51.png) recently posted in r/TrollXChromosomes in which the character muses on her sexuality, and the fact that instead of considering whether her partner is attractive, her arousal is contingent on feeling that her partner finds *her* attractive. She wonders if her sexuality can even be considered her own, as it is based on performing sexuality for others and has little to do with what she finds attractive. It kinda fucked me up because I realized the degree to which I have internalized the male gaze and how much I am appearing rather than acting.	labels:This managed to encapsulate SO many things I struggled with when I was younger, thank you!	episode_done:True

text:i'll tell you why. i have a very very firm opinion that the fashion (and in many ways, the other art) of the early 2000s is rooted in the trauma of 9-11 and the subsequent war(s). it was ugly because it externalized not only the ugly we felt, but the dissociative psychosis of being sold on a violent, genocidal war as justified when it was clearly not. you don't remember it fondly because it is to a certain extent externalizing your trauma and your 'complicitness' (not that you yourself were complicit, you were a kid, but i think to some extent we all felt complicit even at that age? or perhaps the word the younger generations that went through this time period is *helplessness*. *rage*.) we wore unflattering silhouettes that exposed us, grotesque color combinations that clashed, fits that made us uncomfortable, because at some level it reflected our internal experiences.  i am not surprised that now, as we approach 2021, we are back to feeling a need to externalize our trauma, our complicity and/or our helplessness and rage. the rise of authoritaniasm. the preventable deaths of so many people due to a ravaging, uncontrolled disease. the derailing of our lives. the absence of our family members. the casual murder of black and brown and trans folks on our streets. the looming shadow of climate collapse. the police brutality.... is it any wonder we are once again seeking any form of outward expression for that ugliness? that incongruity? that chaotic nihilism we are living on a day to day level? is it any surprise that we are looking to the art of the *other* major collective traumas of our lives for inspiration on how to bring outward the rupture that is within?  anyway, sorry to get political but. yeah we don't have nostalgia for this time for a reason. just as we will lack a nostalgia for this time in 20 or 30 years time.	labels:I've read that the music (the absence of melody and joy in pop) has been the way it has been for the last few years because everyone is depressed!	episode_done:True

text:Hair accessories - professional or should be saved for casual environments?	labels:I personally am not a fan of any type of hair accessories. It looks a little tacky, in my opinion. I don’t think they are professional. E.g. if I wear business professional, NEVER EVER wear hair accessories. If I wear a hair tie, I’ll wrap my hair around it. If I wear a Bobby pin, I’ll make sure it’s the color of my hair.   I think as long as it is subtle, it’d be ok to wear some when dressed in business casual but I’d still avoid it. That’s just my opinion. I also NEVER wear any hair accessories in my leisure time either.

text:Best and Worst Purchase of 2020	labels:Best: Recliner sleep t shirts. I sleep so hot, I got one and just ordered two more. I honestly tend to wear sweatpants the most, but I know when it gets warmer out I really love those sleep shirts. They're pricey but worth it... I can never find sleep shirts I like.   Not clothes, but linen sheets. I went with Lands End because I didn't want to spend $400 (I got them for $119 for a whole king set!). We'd also gotten a new mattress this year, so I've been sleeping really well between sheets, mattress, and fancy pajamas :)  Rothy's Chelsea boots - I already had two pairs of flats, but I wore my chelsea boots more than either of those combined. Comfy and cute with jeans.   Aerie sherpa pullover - I now have two of these cloud sherpa pullovers and I wear them constantly.   A gap upcycled puffer in Black. I purchased a Columbia puffer a few years ago that got a rip in it on the first day I wore it, and I've still been wearing it ever since because I didn't find anything affordable to replace it (I don't wear down, so that makes it a bit hard to find puffy coats!). Gap had some nice, long ones made of non-down and recycled material and it was also under $100 with a sale. Been using it a lot this winter!   Worst: I returned a lot of things this year, so there was a lot of bad stuff. I feel like stores were skimping on quality because of the economy? My only real regret (because I kept it) was a pair of linen bright yellow madewell culotte pants. They're cute, but I didn't end up going anywhere in the spring and they got worn MAYBE once. Luckily they were also only $25. Some things I ended up returning - lots of crap from old navy like a sherpa and some leggings (why do I ever even bother?).	episode_done:True

text:Is fast fashion really fast fashion if you get years of use out of the garments?	labels:The defining characteristic of fast fashion is its 2-12 week production cycle. It's not about how long you or any individual customer keeps any individual item.  It's also not about you in another sense. Fast fashion brands pump out up to 24 collections a year - that's a lot of clothes. [It's well-documented that this is an overproduction of clothing](https://sharecloth.com/blog/reports/apparel-overproduction), and even though the post-production circulation of this clothing [has its own deleterious effects](https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/sustainable-fashion-blog/2015/feb/13/second-hand-clothes-charity-donations-africa#comment-47509657), even if every customer kept their fast fashion purchases for 10 years, [the cost of this enormous production volume would remain](https://www.un.org/africarenewal/magazine/december-2019-march-2020/battling-damaging-effects-%E2%80%98fast-fashion%E2%80%99). This is a systemic problem, and you can't solve it by keeping all your H&M t-shirts for 10 years.  And like, I get where this OP is coming from. I think there is a tendency, particularly on this sub, to blame the unsustainability of the fashion industry on individual consumers, which forces individual consumers to justify their fast fashion purchases as still sustainable in some sense. And of course blaming the individual for the crimes of fast fashion completely misses the point, and most of the solutions that people come up with (just make your own clothes!!111) are totally asinine. It's also kind of insidious how this personal responsibility rhetoric essentially protects corporations and governments from civil society coming together to push for system-level change - especially given that corporations in particular promote personal responsibility to sustainability (buying Eileen Fisher is basically just as impactful as pushing tighter environmental regulations!). I think this rhetoric pushes people to fight between themselves rather than banding together to push for meaningful change.  So I just also want to say that none of this is your fault. You're not a bad person if you can't afford to not buy fast fashion, and you don't owe anybody an excuse for surviving in the system you're in. But I think it's also important to draw a line between defending yourself from accusations of unsustainability and defending the industry from the same - and unfortunately, because of the way we've structured this rhetoric in the US and in this sub in particular, the two usually get blurred.

text:Have your clothing purchases dramatically dropped now that we can't go anywhere?	labels:Ha ha! It's the opposite. I pretty much renewed my wardrobe.

Enough of that this time around and the trend will cycle to something else.  signed,  someone who dealt with many, many ripped jean legs.

text:People with an over the top personal style, how do you incorporate it into your day to day?	labels:When I decide to go big I go big. And that’s that.  My over the top style gets incorporated into my jewelry always...and if I have a loud top then bottoms are muted and toned down, same with my purse.   It’s either about balance or going all crazy.	episode_done:True
text:What did people *actually* wear in 2000's?	labels:Well most cycles of fashion is a new take on an era, not an exact replica, so authentic 2000s wouldn’t be in style, but a 2020 take on it would.   I was in college and we wore low rise flares and tight fitting long tops. I mean, we wanted to look like we had the longest torso and lowest butt ever!!! It was a time to be alive. We wore shiny shit to the clubs and our moms told us not to look like we were wearing our jammies because it was all lingerie-looking.   We lived for a layered look but a fuckin stupid one, like a cami over a t shirt. Or a scarf with a tank top.  I even wore a skirt over JEANS and they were flared wtf.
text:Ugh as someone with an actual long torso, it was so nice to have tops that actually fit!!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What Did You Recently Get Rid of From Your Closet (and How, Please Help Me Help Myself)	labels:I purge about once a season. Lately my purge thought process has been: "when was the last time I wore this?" "will I wear it again in the foreseeable future?" "do I like how this looks on me/fits me?" and "does it make me happy?" There are some items I've kept, simply because they make me happy to look at. But those are few. Most of the clothes I've been keeping are clothes that both fit me well and make me feel good. I've found that by sticking to that mindset, I've not only been more picky about my clothing purchases, but also my purges have been getting smaller as my closet has become more staple pieces than on trend.  I do a combination of selling and donating my clothes. I sell to a local consignment shop and also to places like ThredUp and Buffalo Exchange. Both have a mail-in program that is incredibly helpful. I donate whatever is leftover.	episode_done:True

text:Teach me how to successfully shop secondhand please!! Or just commiserate if it’s hard for you too lol.	labels:### I'm sorry, this is very long. But maybe some people will find it useful.  I find it can be hard to give specific recommendations re:thrifting because everyone is looking for different stuff. Some people want a thrift store where they can buy Reformation and Sezane for three dollars. Other people want 80s and 90s vintage. Some people just want to find really weird, unique pieces. Some want staples in more luxe fabrics than they can afford otherwise. The journey really starts with figuring out what you want, and then forming your process to suit that. One man’s trash is another’s treasure. Maybe the stuff I’m buying is the exact stuff you’d give away; after all, someone did give it away.  This is a process. Thrifting is really a hobby. I haven’t always had money to invest in things, so I chose to invest my time. I’m really paying just as much - but it’s worth it to me because I enjoy spending my time doing this. It is a hobby, but I think it is at least an accessible hobby - it doesn’t require any expensive equipment to get started.   ### Secondhand in Person  A lot of making the most of the secondhand market is having a passion for learning about clothes. I go to vintage markets or inspect very expensive garments even if I know I’m not going to buy it. I go to shops totally out of my price range just to feel the clothing and look at how it is made, and then I internalise that and look for it in the wild. I can recognise brands, time periods, fashions from different countries and cultures, and fabrics because I can compare it with a massive base of knowledge I’ve built up over a long time and am always adding to it.  #### Process  The main way to make thrifting a beneficial process is to go often. Thrifting can be quite cheap, but while you are saving money, you are instead investing your time. At the moment I don't thrift at all because of coronavirus, but I used to thrift probably once a week, hitting a circuit of the same shops. At other points in my life I’ve gone biweekly, or even daily, and at even other points I’ve gone only once a month.   Every shop you go to, even if you end up with nothing, is an education - the more you go, the more you learn. With frequency you will begin to recognise which types of items are abundant, which types of things are uncommon, which shops have which sorts of things. The more items you try on over time, the more colours and styles you realise suit you or really do not suit you. The more items you encounter, the more you learn about the range of quality that exists in clothing. I am constantly building a database in my head of this information, and it is nowhere near complete. I am always learning.  There are a lot of different types of secondhand landscapes out there. Most people will only deal with the thrift stores in their immediate vicinity, and *you cannot project your experience with thrift stores on the entire world*. I have a lot of experience buying secondhand in middle-of-nowhere-Indiana , Seattle, Honolulu, Philadelphia, Montreal, London, random towns in Dorset, Wellington, Riyadh, Tokyo, Barcelona... All of these experiences are wildly different from country to country, town to town, and store to store. Even over time the landscape in an area might change, so if an area doesn’t suit your process, that doesn’t mean it won’t someday, and it doesn’t mean that it isn’t full of things that are very valuable to someone.  ####That Thing Everyone Says  I don’t so much believe in thrift stores in a rich neighborhood so much as thrift stores in rich parts of a country. For example, there are some very wealthy neighborhoods in Connecticut. But Connecticut also has the largest wealth disparity from county to county in America - really rich towns are directly next to really poor towns. So with the way stock gets distributed at chain thrift stores, the rich neighborhood may not have significantly different stock than a poorer neighborhood. Meanwhile in the suburbs of Seattle, I find that the entire area is wealthy enough that there are more "nice" things across the board. These may be more likely to have nice things - but it also depends on your definition of “nice”. The Seattle suburb idea of "nice" is different than the Philadelphia mainline idea of "nice". But honestly, there are some nice things everywhere, and some shit things everywhere, you just have to know how to weed those out. And again, one woman's "nice" is another woman's "hot 90s garbage", so...  Going often, and paying attention to the items you are seeing, is really the most important part of the process. But there are some other things that make this endeavour easier.   I have specific criteria that all my purchases must satisfy, because I find too much stuff. It must be the right style, colour, price, size, and fabric. If it is missing any of those five, I cannot get the item.  I can have all of these criteria because there’s no end to clothing I can find. Minimalism is the trend now, and I am certainly not a minimalist, but there’s an obvious appeal to accumulating fewer things - and in particular, not accumulating things you aren’t one-hundred-percent enthusiastic about.  #### Brands  One of my criteria is not “the right brand”. Brand actually means very little to me, because there is a lot of variety even across a single brand - it’s never going to be a surefire indicator of quality. It does help, however, to have a general awareness of brands, because it can indicate styles you might like and the intended demographic of the garment. Thrifting will help build your mental encyclopedia of brands - you’ll get an idea of what is actually sold at some shops you’ve seen but have never been into, and you’ll start to recognise repetition of certain brands you just don’t recognise v. brands that are much more “no name”.  If you specifically want to thrift designer goods, you need to commit a reasonable list of designers to memory. Some we all know off the top of our heads - Gucci, Prada, Versace, Dior for example - but there are hundreds of other designer brands that may have less familiar names to the average consumer. It will also help if you are familiar with the types of goods they make, which lines do which sort of styles, and the basic tells of fakes. Some fakes are very good, and there’s a market for particularly good fakes, but there are also lots of easily identifiable fakes - learn the logos of brands and where any serial numbers, detailing, hardware, etc. may be located (and what those things look like.) It’s actually a lot of work to become really familiar with this stuff!  There is nothing wrong with focusing on designer items. In my own subjective experience, the brands of things are kind of irrelevant to what I want. Even when doing secondhand shopping online, I disregard the brand of things and just search for the qualities I’m looking for in a piece. I’ve bought plenty of things in thrift shops that I judged on quality/”do I really like this?” alone, having never heard of the brand, and then when I get home and google it I find that it is actually some fancy shit. If I was judging just by brands, I might have flown past those pieces and dismissed them as no name because I had never heard of this couturier or brand or whatever.  Don’t buy things *solely* because they are designer. Don’t buy things just to flip them... unless you are actually going to do it. Buy things because you really like them! I try to judge a piece on its anonymous merit, but I'm not knocking the importance of brands to some people. Just know your stuff!   ###Secondhand Online  Secondhand clothes online are labelled terribly. This is both an advantage, and a disadvantage. It is not always easy to find things using the very specific labels that apply to them - after all, for many sellers on Poshmark the label “midi” means a hemline that falls anywhere from the upper thigh to floor length depending on a person’s interpretation of that term. “Over the knee” boots are anywhere from ankle-high to  thigh-high. Eyelet means lace, and lace means eyelet, and crochet can mean either. “Linen” is often a typo of “lined”... and silk, for many people, is more a state of mind than a word that describes an actual specific fabric.   And while if you are looking for something very specific - say a black silk dress with a mandarin collar - it will be extremely frustrating to have to try every possible way that could be terribly labelled (“oriental satin”).  But if you have an arsenal of common misspellings, misconceptions, and malapropisms, it can also be the way to find gems that are lingered undiscovered due to the incompetence of the lister.   I think of the way people might label things, and use those as search terms. If I’m looking for leather shoes, for example, I might search shoes by “spain”, “portugal”, and “brazil”, because sometimes people will label the country something is made in, but not the material.  I constantly feel like I'm trying to fight the search on these sites, rather than letting the search do the work for me, but it's all good to know all of the potential terms something might be labelled with to make your searches more accurate and effective.
text:Thank you for this comprehensive guide! I see guides to shop SH all the time which make the same points, but I actually learned some new things from yours.   I was wondering: how do you feel about shopping SH online? Do you think it's worth it? I feel like the prices have really gone up on SH online shops, to the point where I'm not sure if it's really much lower than buying something similar brand new. For instance, when shopping for new items I can go in store, try the thing and see if it's for me. When shopping SH online, I often cannot tell how the item is going to fit, whether it has flaws that the seller hid, and often I can't return it. I'm not sure even to what extent the "ethical" argument still holds.  Fun fact: I've been looking on Vestiaire Collective for some wool trousers and chose to display sellers only from my country. There was a pair that was being sold for about EUR 80. Well, in the photos there was a price written in pen on the item's label --- clearly, the item had been bought from a SH shop. Most people would have ignored the price since it's in my local currency, but I knew that it was roughly EUR 7. I understand that there's a price to pay for people that search SH shops in-person for hidden gems (possibly as a job), it just made me realize how highly marked up SH items on online shops are.	labels:> how do you feel about shopping SH online? Do you think it's worth it?  It depends on what your expectations are. It's definitely not *as* cheap as actually buying things in person (although many people would argue that in-person thrift stores are also marked up these days), but it's easier to find more specific things. If you have a specific list of five items you want, it will be far easier to track them down in your size by utilizing an online search than by wandering around from thrift store to thrift store, scouring. I find with in-person thrift shopping, if I'm looking for anything, the search has to be kept a bit broad: "a light-coloured sweater" or "a dark dress". And also accept that may have nothing to do with what I actually walk out of there with.   I still find that buying secondhand items online is cheaper than buying them new, but that may be because I'm good at looking for these things and have a lot of patience.  I also know my measurements and sizes for things very well - and even if a seller doesn't post measurements for something I'll go crossreference the original brand's sizing chart when I can find it. I do sew, so I end up taking some things in if I have to, and that also allows me to be a bit more carefree. I find that most people are very upfront about disclosing flaws, but that may not be the case everywhere.   Another thing that I do is to recognise the worth of my time. I take my salary and identify how much I make per hour. That is how much an hour of my time is worth. So I think about how many hours of my time I might be putting into hunting for a specific item. If the amount of time I've spent hunting for that item + the price I end up finding the item for is >= to the price of the item new... it's not necessarily a good deal.   So I think with online secondhand shopping, the benefit is that you can search for more specific things and buy them cheaper than they would be new (or search for things that are no longer available new). The cost is that it will probably be slightly more expensive than finding things in person (particularly with the added cost of shipping) and you have to pay close attention to the listing and measurements and (maybe badger the seller to give you measurements) to have confidence in what you are ordering.	episode_done:True

I have some other commentary (based on things I have told myself):  Regarding pre-baby clothes : throw them out (or donate). You don’t want to wear them. They are old. They will not make you feel good in your new body. You are older. You are a different person. Buy some new clothes that make you feel great because they fit. Move on with your life.   Ignore the number on the label. It means nothing. Find a good tailor - remember, you’re older now. You can get things tailored. You don’t need to buy Forever 21 anymore. And once the babies are in preschool and you’re not paying childcare anymore, you’ll have plenty of disposable income 🥴  Once the babes are done nursing, BUY NEW BRAS you will feel like a new woman.

text:When/why did you get your first really fancy purse/bag?	labels:I bought my first designer bag with money from a side job teaching a coding bootcamp. I'd been eyeing it very non seriously until I got that paycheque and it felt like I should spend it on something a little crazy because it was only a few hundred bucks. I taught the same course the next year and bought a Switch 😄 I'm generally pretty frugal so I only felt like I could treat myself to that extent when I'd done something that earned extra cash.

So yes of COURSE your clothes are made with slave labour. A barbaric country that uses slaves has an advantage over a civilized country where using slaves is frowned upon. Therefore slavery is their comparative advantage.  Instead of being snobby over clothes I'd get politically active and help put an end to unrestricted free trade. If that seems a little much to you and you'd rather have both the moral high ground and a peaceful life be prepared to spend double or triple aand get picky. Real picky.

They're nice and thick denim and look good enough (in a dark wash) to wear to casual Friday at work but I can still wear them to mow the lawn.  \-London Fog coats. I own two trench coats and a couple wool coats by them, bought them at a department store and I've worn the hell out of them and they still look good.  \-Clarks shoes. My most comfortable pair of shoes ever are Clarks dress shoes. And I've worn the hell out of them for years, literally my every day shoe and they still look good enough to wear to work.  \-Keens sandals. I own a few pairs that have leather straps. The bottoms are made for hiking, but the leather straps make them look like "cute" sandals. They were good enough to pass as dressy sandals for work, and again have lasted for years even though I don't baby them.  \-"Old lady" brand bras. I'm talking stuff like Warner and Maidenform. If you need bras to keep you supported, you can't go wrong with these brands. I have a few that have lacy trims so they're not just "boring" but in general I buy these to wear for every day and I've had them for years. I wash them in lingerie bags and hang to dry and they still look great.   \-Lululemon Luon pants. I don't own any thin leggings from them, but several pairs of their Luon groove pants have been worn by me for years. I've tried other brands like Alo Yoga, T&A and the Amazon brand but the Lululemon wins every time. The Luon is worth the money  That's all I can think of right now, but my general tip for everyone is to wash your clothes carefully to keep them looking good. Treat everything like it's delicate (gentler cycles, try to hang most things to dry instead of using the dryer). Even "cheap" mall clothes last me forever.

text:Your favourite men's style shopping "hacks"	labels:Wear pyjama tops as jackets/overshirts.  They come in a broad range of fabrics/colors/patterns, but all tend to be comfortable (duh).    I have several poplin ones for summer - they often have wider uncuffed sleeves (again, for comfort) so you can go for a sort of noragi look.  (finding a very light fabric chore jacket turned out to be a pain, or they were too expensive. So instead I wear a rotation of thrifted poplin pyjama tops. They look a bit different, but work fine.)  Recently I also got one in flannel, lovely to wear around the house this winter.  They're like oversized overshirts, but also have pockets. I want pockets.

text:Do you: 1) keep all of your wardrobe equally diverse, or 2) keep all of your wardrobe minimal, or 3) keep some pieces relatively similar while diversifying others?	labels:Sometimes I notice that I have a huge wardrobe malfunction, and then I'll plan simply because I can't buy all that stuff all at once on a monthly budget (so that I'll soothe my annoyance, that I have bought too many shoes in the same color/texture or whatever, or that all my remaining jeans in good shape are all dark wash, before I can rid myself of the sea of uniformity that happens in my closet if I don't watch it, that sneaky bastard).  However, I usually buy as I go. I thought I only needed one new cozy crop sweater when I made my huge purchases at the January sale. I was wrong, the cut look too cute with high waisted anything, so it's annoying that my other warmer sweaters look shapeless in comparison.   Also, almost opaque black tights don't go with bright lavender shorts, which somehow didn't occur to me when I bought them, so I'll need some very thin tights, or just buy ones in blush or something (though I'm trying to avoid the ballet look, I didn't buy those shorts to look dance-y, or whatever you call the way tights look when they match your skin color, which is also weird from a certain distance, because you expect people's knees to be more red or something. Or maybe it's because I just live in a place where no-one ever wears anything light colored, I don't know. I always looked extra hard at a pale person wearing blush tights, because it happens so rarely and I get confused by the lack of shade variance on their legs for a moment).   In general, I want my wardrobe to be as diverse as possible. I only consciously buy stuff that looks like each other, if I need some 'rest' between items, which happens rarely, because I usually end up buying basics that just have some color to them that I particularly like. I'm really picky when it comes to stuff like prints or texture, so I have to look a long time to find something exciting and affordable at the same time, making me also get bored quickly. Because I do really like a good black, tiny printed varied-in-size star spattered blouse, with slightly puffed sleeves, an elastic waistband and an conspicuous amount of buttons. Which sounds oddly specific, because it's the most pretty-but-otherwise-also-delightful item I have been able to find for months.	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- October 20	labels:Can anyone recommend a good brand of tank top to use as an undershirt that meets the following criteria?  - Long enough to be tucked into the pants without coming untucked throughout the day by doing things like raising my arms, bending over, etc  - Armholes and necklines aren't massive on larger sizes.   The few brands I've tried, I had to go for larger sizes to meet first criteria, but then I ended up with tanks with armholes and necklines so massive that it looked like one of those goofy wrestling leotards. It looked stupid, and it was also very uncomfortable because I often had the hems rubbing on my nipples. Ideally, the neckline should be low enough that I could wear a v-neck without it being visible, but not so low that it sits below my nipple line. And the armholes shouldn't go lower than a few inches below my armpits. And again, needs to be long enough that I can tuck it into my pants without it coming untucked (I'm 6ft and 220lbs, so I do have a bit of a gut).  Bonus points if it's incredibly comfortable.
text:If you search undershirts on this forum you will find plenty of discussions of different brands. Everyone is different on their preferences but if you are willing to go with something other than a tank top try Sloane Men undershirts. They are expensive at around $30 each but I love mine and they do give discounts on packs of 3. I bought 5 of them over 5 years ago. I wear them 5 days a week for work so each of them have been washed over 250 times and they are still in great shape. Super comfortable, plenty long and they don’t bunch up at all. The XL would fit you fine as we are similar size. You can also order one and try it for awhile and if you don’t like it they will let you return it. I haven’t tried any other brands for a long time because these are perfect for me. I think they are well worth the price since they last so long.    https://sloanemen.com/products/the-invisible-undershirt?variant=13633345030	labels:	episode_done:True

They’re also where I got my favorite cotton sweater (as well as several  totally shit acrylic ones).

If you are wearing a suit 15 times in 10 years like a lot of guys with more casual jobs are a $150 macys or JCF suit with some tailoring in a classic color is a way better buy than a $499 brooks brothers suit.  They are bloth going to be outdated before they wear out, so durability is a nonfactor to most occasional wearers.  If you aren't the type of guy who want's to own suits a polyester lining is going to be indiscernible from a more breathable one.    &#x200B;  The importance of suit quality is vastly overstated as it relates to the average very occasional wearer.

I used to love Betsy Johnson bags when I was younger, but they're not very practical as I use my bags day-to-day as opposed to only for going out.

text:Shitpost Saturday: Fashion AITA	labels:**AITA for standing up for my beliefs against a jealous coworker?**  Last week I turned up to my work Zoom call completely nude. For context, my new year's resolution is to only shop in the most sustainable manner possible, and only wear clothes of the highest ethical standards. Unfortunately, on January 1 I looked into my closet and only had planet killing fast fashion pieces. I couldn't possibly continue to use what I already had, lest FFA judge me for not being an Ethical Goddess. And unfortunately, we didn't get raises at work this year, so I had no money left to buy a brand new wardrobe that met my impossibly high standard - I can't wear animal products because I don't want to cause suffering, I don't want to wear synthetics because of pollution, and I don't want to wear plant-based fibers like bamboo because then I'm taking food away from the pandas who are endangered. So I did what any normal person would do in my scenario - I threw everything out and decided I would go nude. No one is harmed, I don't contribute to the fashion industry, it's the most ethical choice.  All of my coworkers were okay with my decision, except for one who I'll call "B." I'm only 22 and been out of college for six months, but I recently got promoted to senior lead developer on my team. B had wanted that job for a long time and had done many projects that demonstrated her competence, got additional certs, but management just liked me more and promoted me instead, so I think B just doesn't like me and is jealous of me.  B: "Isn't that outfit inappropriate for work?"  Me: "Absolutely not, if you look at it from an ethics perspective. Have you watched The True Cost?"  B: "I don't see how that's relevant here. Can you just put on a shirt at least?"  Me: "I cannot."  During this time my manager was just zoning out. But B kept pushing at me, antagonizing me, and being overall really rude, and I just calmly kept stating that this was my decision and my team would need to live with it. Finally, B said, "I'm uncomfortable with her on this team refusing to wear clothes."  I replied "You're uncomfortable because you're wearing a polyester blouse like the unethical, jealous old hag you are!"  Finally my manager snapped and told me to stop. I thought that was the end of it, but later that day I got an email from HR stating both my manager and coworker made a complaint against me, I was being written up, and now I have to discuss the situation with them or be disciplined further? I can't think of anything I did wrong here and think I'm being unfairly attacked by a jealous coworker.  So Reddit, AITA?
text:You have the right to not wear clothes and I wouldn't have cared but this is a professional setting and you just got promoted. By not wearing anything it gives an image that your company might not agree with because you now represent them. I'm surprised you weren't called out by your supervisors. If you were meeting a client for example you might have been let go on the spot.  In addition, people have the right to feel comfortable in a work setting and although some may have said they were alright with it, discretely they may have been too uncomfortable to say they weren't, this also could fall under sexual harassment. So from the HR point of view you're lucky you're only getting written up.

It has to be a clothes store (no Targets where she could spend it on other things), and I'd prefer a store that's leaning into the current sexy trendy vibes over the frumpy trendy vibes (so no Madewells).   I'm considering Zara, but imo Zara is pretty overpriced so I'm here to see if anyone has any other suggestions! :)
text:not a specific store but have you considered a gift card or something to a subscription clothing service like stitch fix? I know they are kind of hit or miss but I think they make for great gifts! I just feel like with a gift card she might still stick to her comfort zone, whilst with a subscription service she’s got a personal shopper/stylist making picks for her	labels:oooh that's a really good idea! thank you!!	episode_done:True

text:Is the high fashion industry a little tone-deaf for F/W 2020?	labels:Why would it be tonedeaf? This is kind of a U.S.-centric view. Not everyone in the world is still struggling with COVID, and a lot of the rest of the world isn't nearly as casual as America is, fashion-wise.   Call me crazy, but I'm tired of shapeless billowy clothing in earth tones, and I am READY for some structure and interesting textures. All summer has been about beige and washed out green and brown linen, let's see something else.   Plus, it's a weird take anyway, because high fashion doesn't really target loungewear, either way. Do we really expect major fashion houses to all abandon blazers and leather pants and start showing PJs and sweatpants on the runway?   Others have already pointed out that these collections have been designed months in advance, but consider another point - fashion has always been reactive. When forced to stay inside and only wear sweatpants for 6 months, people will rebel and start daydreaming and longing for the opposite. This pandemic was always going to inspire a sort of glam rock aesthetic, imo. BRING IT.

text:Tall beauties of Reddit, tell me your favorite brands that offer tall/long options	labels:Reitmans!! They have lots of tall dress pants and tall jeans. Their products are expensive when they're full price, but they have amazing sales, I got dress pants for $8-15 a few months ago. There's also usually some great deals on the clearance rack when you go shopping in-store. Their hyba activewear line has tall leggings too and they're nice quality, just very expensive.  Old Navy also has tall jeans, typically around $25 I think, and they fit really well! Not quite the same quality as reitmans but still really good, and they've never ripped or anything. They sometimes go on sale for $15 or so.  For affordable tall leggings I usually go with Aerie because they're a bit cheaper than Reitmans, the quality isn't nearly as good though, and recently they've changed to their "offline" brand and I find they're more expensive than they used to be.	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 19, 2020	labels:Is a closed, nonfunctional lapel buttonhole a sign of a low quality suit jacket?
text:It’s a strong signal of a low quality one but I wouldn’t use it as a litmus test.  There will likely be other red flags on such a jacket — cheap lining (polyester), cheap fabric, cheap fusing,  lapels with a hard crease, plastic buttons.  Post the jacket if you want feedback.	labels:It is the Ludlow suit in Italian Wool.  It has a bemberg lining in the body but the sleeves are some kind of poly lining. The main fabric is loro piana super 120, 100% wool.  Buttons are plastic I’m guessing. Jcrews website claims it is half canvassed. I*think* I see the canvassing in one of the buttonholes byt im not an expert. The lapel roll is less “round” than on my older ludlows, but it has softened up more and I wonder if it will continue to loosen up to a nicer shape.  It has a different feel than the other older ludlow suits I own from almost 7 years back..lighter weight and almost papery...not as soft. Maybe it just needs to be broken in?  My old ludlows have a functioning/open buttonhole in the lapel.  What do you think? Keep or return?	episode_done:True

text:What's the greatest length you've gone to obtain a much coveted fashion item?	labels:There was a chartreuse brocade jacket with a faux fur collar from Le Chateau I fell in love with in 2001/2002 ish. They didn't have my size and wouldn't call other stores to find my size, and they didn't have a website where I could order from. They did have a list of cities they had stores in though.  First I took the bus to every store in my city (if I recall there was 4 stores) and I was out of luck. So I went to the library to look up every store number in Canada and I called them one by one (shoving change into a payphone because I didn't have long distance on my flip phone). Some I had to call back because they were busy and didn't have time to size check for me.   Finally I found a store that had one, it was a 14 hour drive....so I didn't do that, I convinced a manager to hold it for me and accept a bank draft for the price (I didn't have a credit card) and once it was paid for, send it internal mail to the store in my town for me to pick it up.  I still have that coat (which is a tad too small for me right now) and I still love it.	episode_done:True

Like maybe you need to do a poster presentation for your thesis, or your org has a formal. They're easy to dress up or down depending on accessories.    Honestly, if you can't think of an occasion where you'd wear one, then you don't need one!

text:How do some people put outfits together so effortlessly. Fashionista's please help.	labels:I think it just takes time to find the right fit for our own bodies. Lots of items look good online/on models, but when we wear it, it's different. It takes practice.   Also, when you mention effortless cool people, you are talking about Instagram influencers right? I think it's good to learn from their way of styling clothes, but only to a certain extent. It would be egregious to try everything they are doing/buying, and too expensive as well. But, lots of fashion influencers know the basics about fit and style, so it's good to take tips from them in the beginning.   I think Zara, HM, Aritiza are great brands to buy from - they are pretty trendy and have interesting stuff always. I don't know what you mean by simple and chic? Do you have examples?
text:Thank you for the tips :) effortless yes, some instagram influencers put on things that if I saw in real life i would never buy but when they style it and wear it I go all heart eyes for it. And then I beat myself up over it cause I think to myself damn why didn't I think of that outfit.    As for simple and chic, im not big on extreme patterns or colours I just want to look put together effortless. Not fond of really bold patterns and colours but don't mind it for special occasions. Zendaya is my style inspiration if that helps. Also i can never find the right wash of denim pants and then I see girls with the exact wash that I had in mind and I go crazy.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do you dress for the (extreme) weather where you're from?	labels:I’m in Toronto, Canada.  By January, no one is wearing cute outfits anymore... it’s all goose-down water resistant parkas, balaclavas, Uniqlo heattech long-johns under thick jeans and heavy boots.  But before it gets to those super extreme sad months, I like wearing a short fitted puffer jacket with a winter down miniskirt over leggings and doc martens.  The short jacket makes me feel like I still have a shape and the down miniskirt keeps my bum warm and looks cute.
text:I’m also from Toronto , at the beginning of winter I try my best to be cute and stylish but  eventually just start to throw on absolutely whatever the hell...mismatched sweaters and scarfs, hats, with whatever thick pants and socks. The tna super puff long and ugg adironack boots have been treating me well even on the coldest of days	labels:Wow I wish I lived there instead. Sounds perfect for me. I love the winter and I love winter clothes! Summer and hot weather is not for me! We only get highs of 35/36 degrees Celsius which is probably nothing compared to some countries. But that’s way too much for me. I can’t go outside in it. I can’t understand people who can spend all day in the heat or laying in the sun or drinking outside at a pub. Hell no!

If Im feeling adventurous I'll wear shorts, but mosquitoes love me so thats always a hassle.
text:Rain jacket is a must. I prefer a really lightweight rain shell with a hood (NO UMBRELLAS HERE!) and layer underneath on colder days.  As for footwear, waterproof is the way to go. Sorel has cool waterproof boots and a leather/pleather knee high boot with waterproof protectant do the trick for normal day use.

text:What are your thoughts on outfit repeating multiple days in a row?	labels:I don't really do this but I'm aware that sometimes it might look like it because I have like 10 black t-shirts that look almost exactly the same.

Pretty sure that if I was doing this with the exact same top and bottom people would not notice.

My two eyes have significantly different prescriptions and I have a slight lazy eye, so I dont trust them to get the pupillary distance correct. I've had bad experiences before with online services so I stick to my optometrist.  Also, I only ever have one pair of glasses because I get headaches when I switch them. So def not fashiony lol
text:Are you me? I've worn glasses since I was 3 years old, only because they caught my lazy eye late. I have severe astigmatism in my lazy eye, which has a farsighted (positive) prescription and my other eye has a slight nearsighted (negative) prescription. Both powers are relatively low but because of how complicated my prescription is, I always go to the optometrist. Because of that, my glasses are pretty expensive, so I end up getting "neutrals" that go with everything- right now I have big black wire frames with a slight cat eye, and am thinking of getting a pair of circular wire frames when I visit the optometrist next week.	labels:My situation is pretty similar to yours. I have severe astigmatism on my lazy eye and also have mild nearsightness on both eyes. Glasses are expensive af for me so I usually wear boring ones due to school rules and that they match with everything.	episode_done:True
text:My Wardrobe Post: Based on what I currently have, what should I wear with what? And an essay reflecting on learning to dress better.	labels:Christ you’re gorgeous and you’ve really put a lot of thought into this.  I looked at your albums (HS til work, and the wardrobe) and perhaps I might’ve missed it but I think you’d look great with a plain tee + button up (tucked in, unbuttoned 1/3 ~ halfway). Maybe roll your sleeves up too?  I also really liked the sweater + collared (I assume a button up) outfit, but I guess the Texas weather ain’t great for that—but I’d love to see you in smart casual. I’m curious how’d you look like with glasses in these types of outfit—it’ll lean towards the nerdy side if that’s your thing. I also think a plain white button up for work would be nice—although it’s common and boring if you wear it right it’ll look great.  Try cardigans? I only skimmed through your future purchase so if you were planning on getting it, oops.  And the Adam Driver resemblance is uncanny—I can’t tell if I prefer you with long hair. You look great in both the work/WAYWT length hairs.  Korean men fashion is somewhat similar to the Japanese fashion style but I think there’s more so if you wanna look into that too.   I know very little about men’s shoes but I think finding more (semi) formal (?) options (leather... etc;) would benefit your outfit in the long run.  I can’t wait to see where you go with all of this!

I'm looking forward to getting the B&S [Oxfords](https://www.beckettsimonon.com/products/dean-oxford?variant=29464405246031) / [Derbies](https://www.beckettsimonon.com/products/dunham-derby-pull-up?variant=29649678499919) to wear nicer leather shoes in fits. I'm considering getting some loafers or a paraboot/similar as an in-between.   The White Dress shirt is a great rec, I like cardigans but need to do some more research into what type/color to get / how to style it before I pull trig on it. I wear glasses when I don't have energy/time to put in contacts, I'm always surprised how much they change the "vibe" of fits. I'll def try the button up 1/3 unbuttoned that's a great idea!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What ultimate-splurge fashion item would you buy to reward yourself for achieving a big milestone?	labels:I usually buy bags for work milestones.  Jewelry for personal/age milestones. But since I’ve completed my ideal jewelry basics already, I don’t know what to get anymore for another future age milestone.  For example, when I got promoted to partner, I bought a Chanel Classic Flap bag (Jumbo).   For other significant milestones in my life I’ve purchased one carat diamond stud earrings and south sea pearls, among others.
text:Just curious, where have you purchased south sea pearls? Or even better what pieces do you have? I love pearls 😍	labels:I have golden south sea pearl stud earrings (about 13mm) and a matching pendant.

The lace comes out of the top right eyelet, but the other side does not come out of the top left eyelet (across from it) which is needed for tying the shoe. Instead, the second lace comes out of the bottom eyelet on the left side, meaning the a lace exits from top R and bottom L. This has happened with multiple pairs of shoes now, and I am wondering why the stores sell the shoes like this. Any ideas? Do I just re-lace? Is there a reason for this?

text:When is a garment worth it to you?	labels:For most reasonably priced items, my rule is (unless there an urgent sale) to wait ~3-4 weeks. If I still want the item just as bad, I get it (or wait for a sale to get it). If I’m excited about something else, then so be lol  For expensive items, I do the same but also find an excuse (holiday, birthday, publish a paper, etc.)
text:Those are both good, I do use the special occasion excuse every once in awhile.

text:What did people *actually* wear in 2000's?	labels:Low rise jeans with a flared bottom, layered cami with lace bottom under a super tight shirt (usually a Henley or polo), shirts tended to have a lot of horizontal stripes. Really skinny scarves were huge. Also, zip up hoodies that were pretty tight too.   If you weren’t preppy there was a LOT of Pacsun clothing like billabong hoodies, surfer-chick style. Also Emo was Hot Topic with checkered vans, converse, band tshirts, weirdly wide leg jeans, and really thick eyeliner.

But I eventually got used to spotting what looked good on me, what didn’t, what I actually liked the most and what suited my lifestyle.   I’m 30 in a few weeks and I don’t follow current trends.

text:What style rules or clothing attributes are you ruthless about?	labels:Nothing that needs to be dry cleaned except winter coats. Hate the smell, hate the bother, hate the expense.  No glitter, no metallic thread. I like it on other people, but on me it makes me feel like I’m wearing a costume. Sequins and paillettes only on formal evening wear (for me).  No dolman sleeves (for me). I don’t like how they look on my busty inverted triangle shape.
text:I only get business outerwear pieces that are dry clean only. For example, blazers, slacks, stiff skirts, etc. I find that I don’t need to clean these pieces after every wear, not to mention I only wear them once, maybe twice a week and only during the school year (I’m part of a coed business fraternity). I find that the dry clean only versions of these items are sturdier and made of thicker material than the non dry clean only versions so it’s worth it to me to take those in once a month or every other month depending on level of wear.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Which color palette do you hate wearing?	labels:Most warm tones or earth tones/muted colors. My worst color is mustard.  I'm a "clear winter" and look best in cripser colors-- jewel tones, icy pastels, etc.  If I wear a white, it has to be pure white, not ivory/beige/oatmeal.
text:I wish I could figure out what season I am. I totally don't understand the questions though	labels:Color seasons were a big thing in the 80s.  My mom was drunk on that kool-aid and I knew mine from a very early age.  I'd start by finding a celebrity that has similar coloring to you (in my case, Anne Hathaway).  Then study their wardrobe and see what color season that people classify the celebrity as.  Pinterest is a great resource for this.	episode_done:True

text:I think a tunic is kinda like a very long shirt. There are women's tunics too so it's referring to a kind of cut. Dresses have more of an flared shape while a tunic is straighter, so since men have straighter bodies a men's dress will end up looking kinda like a tunic.	labels:	episode_done:True

You'll get compliments from gen-x'ers because they used to be cool in the 90's, and you'll get compliments from millennials and Gen Z'ers because they're cool again. They're kinda like the band The Pixies. If you know, you know. They're also terribly comfortable and waterproof.  You'll buy 'em and wear them for years.   People will talk about how they're different now and not as good as before but even this new version are still high quality to me.

I'm not talking about the completely paired back look, where the goal is to very minimal. Ugh I'm not explaining this well. Hopefully this makes sense.

Found so much good stuff that way.)      I'm very much going to let her develop her own style and experiment from as early as she wants.  As long as she is weather appropriate, I plan on taking a supportive, hands off approach once she actually shows interest.    She has definite fit preferences now though (when I do dress her, leggings are a must - no jeans or wide legged pants).  She also hates long sleeves.	episode_done:True

text:Skirts and dresses in winter - how to look good and be warm with a combo of boots, socks, tights?	labels:I tend to stick to more of an olive green/mustard yellow/burnt orange/navy blue color pallet, so black tights definitely don't go with everything. I wear a lot of brown stockings. Basically like tights that are single leg and don't have bad compression around the hips/waist.   Ankle booties are my winter favorite. I find that for my personal style, I like ankle booties that hit right above the ankle with a pair of thick socks that just peek over them, with a pair of brown/light gray/or neutral colored stockings underneath work well with dresses.   I also have some mid calve booties that I enjoy a lot! There's no right or wrong with ankle boots, I love them all.   I live in the US Midwest and wear dresses/skirts pretty much year round, if that helps.

text:Dressing 'out of time' (vintage/history bounding)	labels:When I was in university I was super into the 1950s look. My wardrobe had been a mix of vintage finds from specialized shops, eBay & Etsy, items from vintage reproduction stores, and things from regular stores (H&M, Zara) that had a vintage flair. I never went 100% as it felt too much like a costume to me, but wore a lot of day dresses, circle skirts, button up short sleeve blouses, etc. Paired with more modern items like ballerina flats or high waisted skinny jeans. I also frequently wore red lipstick and either slept with rollers or used hot rollers in the morning to get retro curls.  This was 2012-2014 in western Canada and the reaction was pretty mixed - some students made fun of me and I got a bit of a reputation on campus for being a weirdo, and I got a lot of stares when out in public. That said, I also got some really positive reactions (mostly from women). I eventually moved on from this look but still LOVE vintage items. I have a lot of vintage lingerie and a still have a few of my vintage dresses, tops, and pieces of jewelry. I also recently bought this gorgeous linen blouse from the 1800s at a flea market in Paris that gives me Shakespeare vibes - I like to wear it with distressed jeans and ballet flats.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- November 02	labels:**Should you go for a smaller size stringer tank top if you're "skinny"?**  Skinny in quotation marks cause I'm slender and lack any notable muscle mass in general but have a bit of a belly. I'm around 97 cm or 38 inch on both my chest and belly (waist only 86 / 34 though) and Large in regular tank tops already sits a bit loose on me in general. I could never fit the belly in Medium though, hence why I wear Large.  Stringer tanks seem to be made to be made so that they're pretty loose, but fit snug on a guy with large traps, something I definitely lack. I don't want the stringer tank to just hang on me, so should I choose a Medium anyway to make it sit decently snug at least?  Thanks in advance.

But these things are still on my vague wishlist:  * some sleek OTK black suede boots with a flat heel  * black, comfortable sock boots with a low heel * some slouchy flat gray suede boots, I don't know if these are in this year but I just kind of want to look like Robin Hood * a new pair of really soft, insulated, waterproof pull-on winter boots. I have a pair of dark brown UGGs (not the classic style, they look more like regular boots) that have served me well for years but for whatever reason I'm itching for a new pair. Was thinking of Mukluks but they're really A Look and I guess something more neutral might work better with the rest of my clothes. (But should I care? I don't know)  * A pair of soft suede moccasins as casual slip-ons for Fall--I'd go ahead and buy, but I can't quite decide on a color, black or cognac or warm brown or gray...? * Allbirds in a bright color with a colored sole. This one is particularly frivolous, because I already have neutral-colored ones, but I saw a friend wearing some teal ones with teal soles and they looked so cool	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - January 19, 2021	labels:Well, I've been keeping strict quarantine ever since March 24. I only leave home for work and that's it. Every month or so I meet up with some friends while keeping the safety guidelines: we meet up in open spaces, always keep our masks on, keep safe distance, etc. But other than that I'm home stuck; I haven't set foot in a restaurant, café, mall, movie theater or whatever in almost a year. Some may think this a bit too extreme, and it may be, but I live with family members that may be more susceptible to COVID so we can't take any risks.  Before the pandemic one of my favorite things to do was grab a book, hop into my car and drive aimlessly to see where I ended up. I normally settled down in a café to read or I stopped by a bite someplace I hadn't been before.   I'm a homebody but even I have my limits, so as of late I've been wanting to leave the house and once again wonder around. Maybe I'll do it this weekend. This time around I'll avoid indoor places and just stick to open places, like parks. I'm planning to follow the safety guidelines and everything, but I still can't help but feel selfish. What if unknowingly I'll expose my family to COVID? One part of me feels like I'm overreacting, I mean, everybody I know is going on with their lives and they seem fine. But I can't seem to shake off this latent fear. Maybe the pandemic has affected me in ways that I'm just starting to notice.
text:Obviously follow guidelines for wherever you live as well as your personal boundaries but if you're 1) outside 2) have masks on and 3) stay at least 6ft away from other people your chances on contracting COVID are basically nil. Even more so if you're just say walking around on your own and stay even further than 6ft away from people.   Going to work is easily the most dangerous thing you do imo and getting tested with some regularity (if you can) I think helps peace of mind a lot as well.	labels:	episode_done:True

In the traditional sense, it means the shoulder pads of the coat meet your anatomical shoulder, the sleeves end somewhere between the wrist and the first thumb knuckle, and the length falls somewhere between mig-thigh and the top of your shoes depending on the kind of coat.  But "fits right" also means "how the designer and/or wearer intended". These are all collection images, so they fit exactly as the designer intended them.

Size chart said I would solidly be a medium, but I have a small frame and prefer snug fitting clothes and typically wear a size 4, so I ordered it in small and figured maybe it would be a little tight in the arms...  It was comically oversized. The shoulders started four inches down my arms, the sleeves fully covered my hands. I looked like a little kid wearing my dad's coat, presuming my dad was a low-key drag queen.  I ended up exchanging it for an XS in a deep plum color because they were out of pink.

text:Nobody knows what ‘moderately priced’ means to you. Give a budget in euros.	labels:True enough, I guess. Although asking Reddit about places that sell stuff online (instead of just going to my tailor) should give some indication that I'm not exactly in the market for luxury items.  The budget is adjusted according to quality. I'll need some ties I can wear day to day even with casual jackets and even sweaters, so they can be pretty average, but I might also be interested in some excellent pieces which might cost a bit more.  So if you can point out a place that sells fairly good quality ties for 20 euros, great. If going up to 30 makes all the difference in the world and you know a good place, also great. Maybe there's a great place that sells superb ties for 50 or 70 euros - fantastic, please tell me!	episode_done:True

text:How do you think access and privilege affect your taste and sense of style?	labels:I grew pretty poor in the city. I remember being 13 (this was probably around 2009) and my science teacher said out loud to the class that he thought wearing clothes from thrift stores was disgusting. I was wearing jeans from a thrift store because its all my parents could afford. I went to a public school too with various social classes. I remember all I ever wanted as a teen was to be able to buy clothes from actual stores. I'm also a slightly bigger size (a size 12 in jeans) and my bra size is a 34H, so I had trouble even finding clothes at thrift stores because sizes like that aren't as common. Or they're so common everyone's taken those clothes already. I always see nostalgia things on the internet about people my age and their style back in the early and mid 2000s. And I honestly can't relate to it because being the social class that I was, I wasn't allowed to choose a style or have clothes available to me that I wanted. I took what I could get.   I'm 25 now and like lower middle class as I live in a high COL area. I still try not to spend a lot on clothes because of the way I grew up. I usually shop at Kohl's and Marshalls and since I'm bigger up top and pretty curvy, I try to buy more flowy shirts that accentuate my figure since they look the best on me. Its a little frustrating that I can't wear whatever I want because I do need to shop for my body type. I have big boobs, I'm really curvy and have really wide hips. I'd LOVE to wear a bralette and high waisted skinny jeans, but  that would NOT work for me. So my body type honestly dictates my style a lot.   I still shop cheap and pre covid would frequently go to thrift stores to find work clothes because they usually have way more variety for my body type, now that I know what I'm looking for.  The new switch in recent years to people shopping at thrift stores for sustainability reasons has been interesting to me. I also live in college town USA (Boston) and see tons of wealthy college students always shopping at thrift stores because its the cool  thing to do now. That 90s style I think has definitely started to come back with people that age and thrift stores are the best places to find clothes like that.   I feel so weird about it because to me I appreciate thrift stores for people who aren't able to afford regular clothes as I was one of them and still am to an extent. And sometimes I feel like people who shop there who don't need to are taking away from people who do need those things. And occasionally I also feel like I'm one of those people  But at the same time clothing prices to me are outrageous for what we have to pay nowadays, especially if you don't fit the norm for clothing companies which most people don't. And I think the transition to people caring more about sustainability and just not wanting to waste money on clothes that won't last is awesome and should be encouraged. I know this part didn't really answer your question, just an interesting thing I've observed in recent years!  My relationship with clothing is much better now that I can afford things and buy what I want. My style is fairly relaxed. I'm a plain blue skinny jeans and a nice plain sweater or top kind of person. When I was a teen, I used to tell myself that in the future I'd know I was successful when I would be able to buy $30 jeans from an actual clothing store and not worry about the price. That was all I wanted in life. That's how poor I grew up lol And I know some people are way worse off than me too. I'm just glad as an adult now that I know how to dress for my body, I don't actively hate it and can afford clothes that make it look good and that I like. That's all I want! And more pants with pockets!
text:I definitely agree that the context around thrift shopping has changed and gotten a lot more complicated. I've always been fortunate that even though my family didn't have the money to go out and buy things full price, we live in an upper middle class area and people will donate gently used to new clothes that can be fairly fashionable alongside the worn out junk that no one wants. So despite thrifting being a good percentage of my wardrobe for most of my life, I did actually have some choice in style, even if it wasn't to the degree shopping in actual shops would provide.  What I've really noticed with the influx of people thrift shopping now, is the thrift shops experimenting with raising their prices slowly. I think the assumption is that they have more well off consumers now, and many of the local ones are charities so there's kind of a presumption that by buying there you're helping out that charity and you shouldn't complain about the price because it's going to help kids/vets/whoever. The thing is, not everyone who's started thrifting is necessarily doing it because they actually are well off. We've had a recession that the middle class and lower never actually recovered from, and I think you have a lot of people who might have been buying from walmart now going to thrift stores more often because it's less shameful.	labels:Bleh, you're right about the prices. The higher prices are fine when you find a higher quality item, but most of the stuff in thrift stores is low quality or worn out and the higher prices often equal what the item costs new.	episode_done:True

text:What's your fashion tragedy?	labels:We had a moth infestation over COVID. Normally it wouldn’t have happened, but suddenly we both stopped our suit-wearing office jobs and put all of our wool dress clothes, blazers, cashmere sweaters etc. away in a dark corner of our walk-in closet starting in March.   Then by the time we saw a moth flying around in July, the moths had already eaten holes in several items. They love the expensive stuff - cashmere, wool suits, wool coats. Our cheapie casual stuff? Our polyester athleisure? Ha, hard pass and straight for the Max Mara jacket. It cost ~ two thousand dollars in damage (two of my husband’s suits, one of mine, one dress, 3 dress pants, 3 cashmere sweaters, a wool coat); drycleaning, moth prevention and extermination combined. And it took an amazing amount of time - we had to move everything out of our closet, wash, freeze, bake and/or dryclean everything, then I probably purchased every single not-too-toxic pest control item known to man (incl. some moderately toxic bug bombs which we then had to air out our home for a few days). I think I spent about $120 just on garment bags alone. Then the buggers moved to our other closet and we repeated that process for the entry way closet. Finally had the exterminator come twice and it seems to be under control.  Quite honestly a two month nightmare, and no, not covered by homeowners insurance. We managed to get two holes rewoven (a very high level highly technical skill that only very good tailors know how to do and was $60 per hole) on two peices. I learned how to darn and fix holes in looser knits and weaves like sweaters. But god. It was so horrible.  My husband had particularly expensive stuff affected, but actually I lost more because I had more things that were just in the realm of “is this worth $60 to repair and $20 to dry clean?” and ended up deciding no on a few of them so ended up tossing. Also one of my cashmere sweaters, though not cheap, was honestly beyond repair.

text:My incomplete guide for buying less in 2021	labels:I find that writing a list of things NOT to buy has really helped me be more conscious of the things I buy. I stuck the list on my wardrobe to remind me that I have too many scraves/ winter coats / shoes that I don't even wear.

text:Haha...just bought a coat that despite being on sale was probably overpriced for what it is. But I'd been lusting after it for months and I waffled for several days before pulling the trigger. It's a small run item and there's no guarantee that I'd get another chance at the same colorway next year or even for several years. Sometimes you just gotta *treat yo'self*	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Thoughts on jumpsuits?	labels:I love jumpsuits, but the dressy ones in place of a cocktail dress, not in place of my casual clothes.   I wear them whenever I can for events though! I have a velvet one-shoulder one, a cape one, and a pink flutter-sleeve one and I’m always much happier in them than freezing and naked-feeling in a dress.	episode_done:True

text:Funny enough my target clothes are some of the better quality clothes I own now but I have noticed a lot of their new designs are just....atrocious.   Also, has anyone ever purchased a women’s graphic tee from target that hasn’t immediately shrunk and made them look like a popped can of  biscuits?	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How Much Clothing Should I Own?	labels:I understand where you're coming from, and have decided myself to pare down this year and buy higher quality staples. I spent a couple of years buying inexpensive clothes (like shopping at thrift stores and for clearance items at Old Navy) to see what felt right style-wise (a practice I highly recommend over buying that expensive, high-quality item that sounds good in theory but may not work out so well), but I find that I keep going back to the classics and I don't enjoy as much figuring out what to put together.  Check out [AshleyWeston.com](https://AshleyWeston.com). She's a celebrity stylist. Her "Essential Wardrobe" is the best capsule wardrobe I've found. While everyone's style is different of course, the items she's selected are pretty much timeless, and the best part is they're interchangeable, so all you have to do is put something together based on the context (casual, formal) and the weather. That means less decision making for what to wear every day, which for me is a bonus.  It's around thirty items in all (there are optional colors you can get for a few things as extras), and includes everything from T-shirts to a suit, shoes, belts, etc.  I find her website a bit confusing, so you can do a search for "Ashley Weston men's wardrobe essentials" on YouTube and the video series will come up.
text:Thank you! I'll absolutely check that website out. I do think that any minimal wardrobe is going to rely heavily on different pieces being interchangeable so that's something I'll definitely be heavily considering when buying things.	labels:You're welcome. Yes, the degree to which her essential wardrobe is interchangeable is astonishing. Super useful.	episode_done:True

text:What is your one clothing item that makes your life better that everyone should have?	labels:Where I live, layering is critical year round, yet it took me till last year to get a down vest. That thing has absolutely changed my life. We were evacuated for a week in October due to fires and I forgot to grab the vest, but my husband saw it on his way out the door and knew to grab it for me. I can't tell you how happy I was that he did.  I'm sure everyone else living in a chilly place has a vest collection already, but if anyone out there hasn't gotten around to it yet, I promise it will be worth it.
text:I live in the Midwest and can’t live without a black puffer vest. It goes with EVERYTHING & great for weather from October - April.

Winter is easy, but I never have anything to wear in the summer. Any brands or shopping ideas?
text:These might be too obvious (and out of budget) but Rick Owens or MM6	labels:I do have some Rick owens pieces and they’re perfect for that aesthetic!!

text:MFA Theme WAYWT Challenge: 6 Degrees of Separation - Submissions	labels:[Full Album](https://imgur.com/a/mGmrymp)  [Fit 1](https://imgur.com/iMxw20a) – Started out pretty simple and casual, just a sweater and some fatigues. Wasn’t sure what to do for footwear, so I threw on some vans. Noticed later that one was black and the other blue, but I couldn’t be bothered to take another picture.  [Fit 2](https://imgur.com/Y7LM4gq) – Kept the fatigues and leaned more into workwear by switching to a flannel and adding a waxed canvas jacket. I like the way the flannel looks tucked in and unbuttoned to pretty low. Think I would prefer this with some chunkier boots than what I have. Something like Iron Rangers or Docs.  [Fit 3](https://imgur.com/kpkTW46) – This change is a lot more drastic, but I promise I actually kept a piece from the last fit. You can see the collar of the flannel poking out from under the sweater. Used a similar color palette and I tried to keep the milsurp/workwear vibes alive with the field jacket and cowboy boots.  [Fit 4](https://imgur.com/aRZtwAV) – More of a basic bastard fit. I tried to maintain the last shreds of workwear with the trucker jacket while leaning pretty heavily into the basic bastard vibes with the CDBs while keeping the khaki chinos.  [Fit 5](https://imgur.com/fYnQwtY) – Keeping the sweater, I went with some cords and a pea coat to make it more elevated than just a simple basic bastard. Color palette is pretty dark, and it’s definitely the warmest fit of the bunch. I think it could benefit from something like a sleeker cap-toe boot, or some paraboots.  [Fit 6](https://imgur.com/QcJQ78m) – Last fit, super comfy. Wasn’t entirely sure what to do, so I kept the cords and brought back the sweater from the first fit. Threw on a cardigan to try round it out, but I’m not still not sure how I feel about it here.  Had a lot of fun planning fits and taking pics for this challenge and I’m pretty proud of myself for being able to go full circle with it. I tried to only keep it at one piece shared between fits, and I think I did alright with that. I think this challenge has really helped me visualize what I have and what I can do with that. It also confirmed what I already knew; I definitely need more shoes and outerwear.  Edit: Fixed links
text:Like your stuff! For some reason I’m getting a very “English country club” vibe mixed with a western type deal. Not just cause of the cowboys boots lol.   Really good stuff all around.

text:It's honestly so much easier than you would expect. Once you get threading the machine down, I'd recommend printing out some worksheets of lines to practice straight and curved sewing on and then you're really good to go for simple things. Patterns can be a little tricky to read at first but once you get the hang of it it's fairly simple. It might be handy to check out a couple of books from your library if you can to learn the basics first, but I'm sure you'll be able to make some gorgeous pieces quicker than you think!	labels:I made my own cave woman costume with a sewing machine	episode_done:True

text:Technical/Labwear but make it fashion	labels:It’s literally the worst because materials like lyocell and rayon not just burn but melt and stick  to you if they catch fire so it was a massive no no at the labs I worked. On the other hand natural fibers or those with retardant treatments are expensiveeeee and I didn’t want to spill something on myself that would ruin them.  I ended up wearing a lot of dark wash skinny jeans and straight leg pants + nice fitted tshirt or elbow length sleeve sweater. Blazer or jacket over the whole thing when not in the lab; lab coat (it was a rule) when in the lab. It’s boring but worked well and the jacket layer makes it a bit more of a professional or fun look depending on what you choose. Not super fashionable / self expressive but eh.
text:Our lab coats were flame retardant and had fitted sleeve openings, so putting that on over full-length sleeves was a nightmare. I ended up with a lot of button-downs with sleeves that hit around the elbow, and everything had to have a relatively fitted sleeve so it wouldn't get bunched up and bulky under the lab coat.	labels:Oh I finally realize why the men in my labs complained about the lab coats!

Long enough pants are important, but wanted to point out tops fit differently too! For those, Banana Republic and Eddie Bauer work for me, although I’ve had some luck with Old Navy too.

text:I (M/39) just bought some bright yellow, women's, terry loungepants from August November. What wonderful "non-female" fashion items have you purchased recently? Do you ever dip into the men's section?	labels:I regularly buy men’s clothes. Today I bought a cute 90s looking striped long sleeve from H&M on sale to layer with a turtleneck and some baggy jeans.   I enjoy men’s jackets more than women’s jackets primarily because I enjoy baggy fits and usually they’re thicker for a decent price. I don’t have to worry about the bells and whistles. My favorite jacket recently is a great Carhartt jacket I stole from my boyfriend.   Most of my t-shirts are men’s too, as well as other basics. Pants I can’t really do unless they’re sweats, because men’s pants rarely account for ass as I soon realized. It’s too risky, but I’ve had some success. I have some vintage Dickies that work well on me, but the newer men’s ones don’t fit past my thighs	episode_done:True

text:I've taken 566 outfit photos over 4 years (my style from mid-20s to 30)	labels:I identify with the shopping thing and the corporate retail thing.  I lost like 90lbs back between 2012-2013 and when I got to my smallest, because I could actually wear all these awesome clothes now... I also BOUGHT all these awesome clothes.  I swear I was buying something new ALL THE TIME.  And this is where the corporate retail thing comes in -- I wasn't corporate, I was a sales associate in the Juniors' section of the department store.  I saw new trendy things come in all the time and I jumped on them every time I saw something I liked.  The store I worked for made everyone get their store credit card, and I hit their card's "elite" status within a year of working there.    To put this into perspective, you had to spend $1500 to get to that status, which meant I spent well over $1500 on clothes in just a little over a year at that one store alone. That's not including the amount I spent after reaching that status, or the amount I spent on clothes from other places.  Like you said, the price of a small flat.  The rent for my house right now is as much as I spent on clothes that year, and the truth is I really spent way more than that. It is appalling. And also, to put icing on the cake, within the next year or two I had started gaining back the weight I had lost so I basically got to enjoy all of those clothes during the year- year and a half that I owned them and they all eventually got donated as they became unwearable.  So, over $1500 worth of clothes spent and do you know how many of those I still have?  5 items.  I have a tshirt, a cardigan, and two dresses. That's it. Everything else got donated.    Needless to say, lesson learned!  I'm in the process of losing weight now and I'm a little over 20lbs away from my goal, and this time I'm only buying clothes as I need them and only little bits at a time to get me by.  Once I hit goal, I'll splurge a little more and do a bit of a wardrobe overhaul, but I don't plan on going crazy like I did before.  I don't care how much money you have; it is never necessary to spend a 4 digit number on clothes. Let's spread that out over 4 or 5 years, right?  That makes lots more sense.
text:I hate how much I spent on clothes that I hardly wore. It's a shocking habit that is actually really hard to kick.  I know people who put EVERYTHING on AfterPay and get sucked into the allure of it by buying more than they can realistically afford.  I think people need an event like weight loss/gain, a new job, etc, to learn the (very hard and expensive) lesson of pacing oneself with consuming fashion. Clothes can make you feel so good, but at the same time can actually be quite devastating.	labels:I see the ads for AfterPay and it seems so obviously predatory... it reminds me of a Planet Money NPR podcast on how you can finance a cheeseburger in Chile.

text:Best and Worst Purchase of 2020	labels:Best: a super comfy pair of yellow-beige pull-on cargo pants in chino fabric that I wear all the time instead of sweatpants [(this style, different colour)](https://www.instagram.com/p/CFxlpBqsA84/?igshid=le0fmsp7rm78). Just as comfy as sweatpants, but with pockets up the waa-zoo, and slightly more "I look like I tried to get dressed". So happy with the purchase, I bought a pair in black. I would have got the cream ones as well, if they were still available... Cheap, comfy, and makes my 41 year old booty look like a 25 year olds. What else could a girl want?   Worst: an [H&M wool cardigan](https://www.instagram.com/p/CIX1_5CM2jW/?igshid=1w4y84258ykdk) that was on a lot of influencers in September. I wish I could say that I got it on sale, but I think I paid about $70cdn for it. First it took 2 months to arrive. Then it shed over everything in my closet. Then I got an allergic reaction the first time I wore it, then I tried wearing it over another shirt and got so itchy that I threw it away while I was out and about. I think I managed to wear it for a total of 37 minutes.  I've since washed the shirt I wore with it twice, and still can't get rid of all the hairs  that the cardigan shed on it. Fur remover sticky sheets don't work. I think I might have to go to town with a pair of tweezers, because I'm not losing a shirt to that abomination. Itchy, messy, and late to the party. And that is all that I want to say about that.	episode_done:True

Once, I found a pair of Citizens for $11, and I assumed they must be damaged in some way to be discounted 95% - but they were in perfect condition. In the same order, I bought a “like new” Eileen Fisher sweater for $28, which seemed like a pretty reasonable price for a basic sweater from several seasons ago, and it had a half-inch hole in the chest. I don’t know what the deal is with ThredUP’s quality control but especially considering that all returns are subject to a restocking fee, I’m not willing to spend more than $30 on an item or more than 20% retail price

text:why are men's clothing generally not as expensive and better quality?	labels:I work at a large chain fast-fashion retailer and across the board men’s clothes are wayyy better quality for the same price as women’s. The jeans are particularly obvious in the regard; the same line of jeans held up way longer for my male friends.   One reason could be that on average, more men are shopping for necessities while more women will look for fashionable clothes. (Just my own experience from working in a large family-oriented store.) I find that more men will value durability and comfort than women, and don’t care about fashion trends as much. So companies know this and want to keep them coming back to their stores. Whereas women’s fashion displays will change seasonally if not monthly to fit the demands of the customers.
text:I think most of it is general preference. There are a lot of women's jeans that are thick and durable; they're just not cute or comfortable. As an mtf the first thing I noticed was that all women's clothing has softer, thinner and more comfortable fabric across the board.  Don't confuse thick and durable with comfortable. I wore men's jeans for about two decades, and I'd never, ever use the word comfortable to describe them. They're thick, starchy and scratchy. Cargo shorts, on the other hand, is probably the only piece of men's clothing you could ever get me in again lol.	labels:Yeah 100% cotton jeans are like denim prisons.	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 01, 2021	labels:Does one inseam in jeans tend to differ as you go up waist sizes? I know that sounds silly, but I’m not sure what else could be happening here in my experience  When I used to weigh a lot less I wore like a size 30 or 32 waist with a 34 inseam. Now I’m like a 36 or 38 waist, and a 32 inseam is borderline too long for me in every pair of jeans or pants I’ve tried at this size.
text:No it doesn't it's all quality control have you actually taken a tape measure and measured the inseam of the pants? Because I  would bet  32s are longer then they say and your 34s are shorter	labels:I know there’s probably some element of that, but back when I wore 34s I had probably tens if not a hundred different pairs over the years and that was consistently the right size for me, and now over the course of like 10-20 pairs that I’ve gotten or tried on at 32, that seems to be the size I need to wear right now too.	episode_done:True

I wouldn't mind wearing men's rugbies (and I've found some pretty cool ones), except that I'm reasonably busty and men's cuts never fit properly on me. So in 2021 I really want to find some neat sub-$100 women's rugby shirts—am very much open to suggestions, so send them my way if you can think of any! (Especially if easily available in Canada)

text:How do you dress in a casual work environment if you really enjoy fashion/dressing up?	labels:When I’ve worked in places without much of a defined dress code, I’ve used two criteria to choose my clothes: 1) what clothing will allow me to do my work comfortably and 2) how do I want my supervisor/coworkers to think about me. When I worked in dead-end jobs in industries that I eventually planned to leave, I definitely leaned hard into dressing in a way that made me feel sexy because I wasn’t worried about my coworkers’ perception of me affecting my career advancement. Now that I’m in a job I care about and in which my career advancement depends on my supervisors’ and clients’ perception of me as competent, intelligent, and professional, I hew much more professional in my dress. Nonetheless, I express myself/my style by wearing a lot of skirts and dresses(usually knee-length) because I feel sexier in skirts and dresses than trousers. I wear stilettos most days and I try to choose blouses with a v-neck or a bateau neckline. I would characterize the gestalt as professional but youthful.   Since you are going to be one of the younger employees at your new job, I would recommend leaning more professional in your dress, especially during the first few months when people are getting to know you. Once people are confident in your abilities and your capacity to be a team player, then you can relax a little and incorporate more fun pieces into your work dress	episode_done:True
text:What do you think about having a signature style vs. a variety of looks?	labels:Is that a contradiction? I know some people are into having a “uniform,” but I don’t think “signature style” has to mean always dressing the same. I wear whatever I gravitate towards and it adds up to a personal style on its own.

text:Lessons from a Year of No New Clothes	labels:With sales, I am working to remind myself that it is cheaper to buy nothing at all.

text:Post-Baby Problems I Wish Someone Had Warned Me About	labels:To those reading, I absolutely would **not** go into a pregnancy (or decision on one) *expecting* all of the issues OP mentioned. But, at the same time, *everyone* reading should be aware that pregnancy, child birth, and nursing all come with intense demands on the body and possibly life-long effects (some much more dangerous and impactful than mentioned in the OP which obviously was just focusing on fashion). Remember this if you're ever tempted to suggest someone have children for your benefit ("I need a grandchild" being one of the most common).  For my part, my body was back to it's pre-baby weight within weeks of birth and that absolutely meant I could fit into all of the clothes I could before except those that couldn't accommodate my enlarged chest. I had a waist, though my ab muscles were less strong and it took a while for my abdomen to not just look kinda flabby. (Well, it's still flabby, but no more so than pre-baby.) High waisted pants weren't needed (which is good because I feel uncomfortable in that style). Neither were shape wear, body suits, many bags (one small diaper bag for every day and one backpack like one for airport travel with a breast pump), or gel inserts. My rib cage measurement is slightly smaller than pre-pregnancy at 15 months out, my shoes fit the same as ever, and I wear the same jeans.   The largest physical effect I had (that fucking demolished my self esteem until it resolved 12 months out) was my already large breasts grew to comical proportions and were about 3 cup sizes different in volume. So yeah, I definitely wore baggy clothes, but not for heat regulation. And I started using a menstrual cup within 3 months of birth, because the promised period delay was a damned lie, but I did need to change the cup I used because the landscape had indeed changed and I think my cervix is positioned lower. I've always had issues with deodorant being effective, so no idea if hormone changes would have effected that.
text:I’m very nervous about what will happen to my boobs when I eventually get pregnant. I’m like a 36DDD or so and I can’t imagine them even bigger!	labels:Mine were a 32 FF US/ 32 H UK before pregnancy. They're similar now 15 months out (3 months out of weaning), though closer to a 30 band depending on brand since I'm slightly lower in weight than pre-pregnancy. But they were a 34 J *ish* while lactating and highly asymmetrical so no bra actually fit (too small on one cup and too large on the other as a compromise). And then kinda papery and empty and weird looking in excess loose skin while shrinking back down, but that's been going away so I'm very close to pre-pregnancy form including in the "fullness" of them.	episode_done:True

text:What are your feelings on thrifting from “problematic” brands?	labels:I thrift at a local thrift store that offers jobs to people that want to slowly reinsert the work market and the profits fund local food banks and services. I'm more than happy to fund these initiatives with my pocket money. I think that this could be a more ethical way of thrifting that using Poshmark (I find that Poshmark is a little bit out of my price range)	episode_done:True
text:What are some stores/brands that have surprised you?	labels:Abercrombie! I always associated Abercrombie with the clothes that I wanted but couldn't afford to buy when I was 12 and too dark, too scented stores. But I've found that their denim selection is actually fantastic with lots of classic and trendy options! I have a weird size (2, curvy fit, long), and a lot of stores will have curvy fit but not available in long or vice versa. I think they must be trying to re-brand themselves , because their sizes go up to larger sizes now than they used to as well :)
text:Yes! I hadn’t shopped at Abercrombie since I was a teenager (when all of their clothes were plastered with those tacky logos), but I recently bought some high waisted linen shorts and a chiffon midi skirt from their clearance sale and I am in LOVE. Everything fits so well and is incredibly flattering, and I can tell the quality will hold up for awhile. Whoever rebranded the style of their clothes is a genius.	labels:	episode_done:True

I'd probably pay full price for an olive and a black pair but I ended up getting these in gray for 60 bucks which is an absolute steal imo.  Worst: the bike I panic bought for a covid project that ended up having a rusted out rear triangle. Ended up scrapping it.	episode_done:True

text:How have you changed your style and/or shopping habits after your body has changed?	labels:I'll add my 2 cents as someone that went through a big weight change about 4 years ago and how I've accepted/adjusted to it.  Until about 35, I weighed 110 and my concerns were always about trying to add curves with clothes since I had no butt and a flat chest.    A few lifestyle changes...I quit smoking!  I started working from home (so similar to what people are experiencing now) and I went on birth control.  All those factors together lead to a 50lb weight gain in about 6-8 months.    At first I didn't believe what my clothes were telling me.  I thought oh these jeans must have shrunk or those always ran small.  I was still cramming myself into size small or extra small tops because it was all I had ever worn.  Then one day I saw my own reflection in a window and thought "that poor girl needs to just go up a size or two" and then I realized it was me.  I used to love body hugging clothes like close fitting turtlenecks but now they just accentuate the parts of me I don't like.  I've switched to flowy tops and sweaters.  I used to avoid maxi dresses if I couldn't wear a push up bra because they made me look sooo flat chested.  Now I love them and its so nice not worrying about bra straps or a strapless constantly sliding down.    The biggest obstacle for me has been to stop fixating on the size on the label and just get the size that looks and fits the best.  I also was really motivated to lose weight for a little while and still bought the smaller sizes even if I could barely get in to them.  I lost a little of what I gained but I think my body is just happier at the heavier weight.  I think I look better too but it was hard giving up the "I'm the skinny girl" identity I had for so long.	episode_done:True

text:All-time favorite cold weather pieces?	labels:Any recs for winter boots/slippers that either have excellent arch support or that I can use orthotic insoles in? I have an ancillary navicular bone in each ankle. If my arch is not supported well, the bone will cut into my tendon and cause a LOT of pain.   Supports in shoes or surgery are my only options. I cannot even walk around the house barefoot. 😥 At home I have been just wearing wool socks with a pair of birkenstocks. But I miss the feeling of wearing comfy, warm, slippers.	episode_done:True
text:What do YOU do with "chub rub" jeans?	labels:I am reading this and feeling weird. I like it when jeans fade naturally, I like it when natural rips occur. We are spending money on ready-made signs of wear, which always look unnatural or too done (ripped jeans). There is something beautiful in natural fade and signs of use.   Ok, I might downgrade the jeans formality but jeans are jeans, they are meant to be workwear, they are meant to be washed, they are not ever meant to be formal.
text:Which is fine if it’s the knee or cuff etc. we’re talking about holes in the upper inner thigh and groin area no one wants a hole there and it wouldn’t very stylish.	labels:Sure, those yes, but there are some people going on off-topics (a bit) about other holes or fades.	episode_done:True

Even if you pay $20 for a pair of sweatpants at the store, you can get 8 pair for what you'd spend for one of those...
text:Depends on your attitude toward clothes and your budget. "You get what you pay for" still applies to sweatpants because the more you pay, the more likely you'll get a pair that has softer, pill-resistant, longer lasting fabric that's ethically made with an attention to details like the right amount of elasticity at the waist/cuffs, drawstrings that are easy to correct and tighten, etc. A $20 pair can be serviceable to someone who just wants sweats to throw on, but the quality and satisfaction is more variable.	labels:This sounds like a circlejerk copypasta lol.	episode_done:True

I'm usually a hidden behind the scenes, jeans and t-shirt type of girl but I had a spontaneous surge of confidence that day and decided to wear my new outfit. I was feeling extra cute all  day til I got home from school and a relative of mine gasped and said, "YOU CAN SEE YOUR UNDERWEAR THROUGH YOUR SKIRT!"  I checked in the mirror and realized with horror that my white skirt was sheer and you can clearly see the cartoon giraffe head on my Lisa Frank underwear through my skirt. There. was. a. large. giraffe. face. on. my. butt.  It's been almost 20 years and I still think about that.  Edit—Reading through the responses, I now realize that this question was more about fashion tragedies when you ruin clothes. I didn’t ruin my clothes—just ruined my life and dignity (or so I thought in high school lol)

text:Military Adjacent	labels:I was all gung ho about coming in like "but actually military clothes suck."  Except, after having spent half a decade in the US Army, I actually can't see any single piece that seems... military?  Or military-adjacent as it were.    I feel like I've discovered some weird realm of clothing which pays a tiny bit of lip service to the idea of being military surplus but actually diverged about 50 years ago.  The only fashionable item in the US Army is the [poncho liner](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/USMC-120619-M-PT151-002.jpg/220px-USMC-120619-M-PT151-002.jpg) and that's more a psychological thing than anything else.  Outside of the Army the Marines have an optional boat cloak for their dress uniform which is like $500 which is roughly the sexiest thing in the universe.
text:It's like the only thing remotely "military-adjacent" about this is that they're wearing olive colored jackets? I dunno, I don't see it at all.	labels:Several of the lighter jackets are in fact military jacket liners. The bomber jacket, well, it's for flying cold bombers. Several pants and other more divergent pieces have cargo pockets. Others are wearing combat boots. I mean, it says adjacent...	episode_done:True

text:Lessons from a Year of No New Clothes	labels:Wow! I feel like I was meant to read this. I commend you on your discipline! I’ve struggled with “sad shopping” for a couple of years now, but the pandemic has made it so. Much. Worse. I just love the “high” of buying something cool and the thrill of waiting for my package to arrive, but I’d say I ultimately feel disappointed or unfulfilled by 50% of my online purchases.  In the last year, I’ve done at least 3 small closet clean outs, tossing so many things I’ve bought only within the last year or so that I just never really got around to wearing because either A) it didn’t fit me like it did the models or B) because it doesn’t actually mix well with the rest of my wardrobe. I’m totally a sucker for buying something on a whim because it fits my particular aesthetic/obsession for that week instead of  my long term personal style.   I feel so incredibly wasteful shopping this way, and I really want to change that habit over the next year. I think your tips of unsubscribing from emails and unfollowing retailers on social will probably REALLY helpful, because I’m such a sucker for good marketing.   Thank you for sharing!
text:>I’m totally a sucker for buying something on a whim because it fits my particular aesthetic/obsession for that week instead of my long term personal style.   What steps did you take to really hone in on/understand what your personal style really was? I want to do this but im not really sure how. From staring at my closet, I know I enjoy jeans and apparently I like pinks, yellows, and white lol	labels:Yeah, I can definitely look at my closet and pick out the dominant colors I gravitate towards; for me, it’s brighter and more heavily saturated colors like punchy reds, deeper blues, and bright greens (I feel like muted colors and some neutrals wash me out). But something REALLY helpful that I’ve done is take a full body selfie every time I get “dressed” dressed (WFH has made for way fewer actual outfits this year). I can pick out not only what looks good on me that way, but I can remember the days that I felt really good in what I was wearing. There are also some pieces that I have that have withstood the test of time, and a few newer pieces that I’ve already gotten more than my money’s worth out of, and THOSE pieces have a very clear look to me. I totally don’t have it figured out and I’m still learning but it’s definitely more clear to me now than it was at this time last year!	episode_done:True

text:Good quality men's jeans?	labels:Just wanted to reply that I'm a raw denim guy, but a lot of people are going to throw out raw denim recommendations to you.  One thing to be wary of.  Raw denim is unforgiving, so in the slimmer cuts I have found them **MORE** likely to have crotch blowouts than other jeans.    I've never had issues with crotch blowouts in your standard levis/gap/j. crew brands.  My first 2 pairs of raw denim had crotch blowouts, because I wore slim fits, and the point of tension is in the crotch.  My 21.5 oz and 16 oz raws had holes forming within 6 months.  I've since bought a pair of Samurai's in a straight cut and they seem as if they will last forever, but they are NOT slim.
text:Hi there! Thanks for the heads up, I suppose I won't count on the raw denim to fix this issue. Based on what you and others have said, I may have to give the sizing a closer look!  Very helpful :)	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Rant - I'm fed up with fashion and "expressing myself"	labels:I really, really feel you on the part about fashion changes, the amount of options, and the shopping experience. I'm not a fashionista but I do feel like it's important for me to look the way I feel. But I get overwhelmed when it comes to shopping and putting outfits together. I tend to thrift most of my clothes and, like you said, fashion changes so quickly that by the next year much if what I thrifted already looks outdated. Going to the stores stresses me out so much - I spend so much time looking for clothes (I can admit I overanalyze and overthink every purchase I make) only to go to the fitting room and find that most items (if not all) do not fit for one reason or another. I end up leaving the store like I just wasted an hour plus of my life that I will never get back. Then putting outfits together- oh gosh the stress. Again, I know I overanalyze things, but getting dressed is often a reminder of 1) my inability to shop for myself and 2) all the items I'm missing/need to buy/etc. So then it turns into a cycle- I start getting dressed, stress over what I need to buy, start shopping for said item, becoming overwhelmed at the stores/selection, repeat.

text:Recent Purchases - October 25	labels:[https://imgur.com/a/nwQtfjf](https://imgur.com/a/nwQtfjf)  &#x200B;  Firstly sorry for the messy mirror! I just moved houses and don't own a full length mirror yet so only a bathroom mirror for now. I got both pieces used for what I consider insane prices! Any feedback would be much appreciated!  &#x200B;  1. Balenciaga leather jacket- I'm a bit of a leather jacket nut and own admittedly too many leather jackets. This piece feels and looks insane imo, though there is a slight issue. When I wear the jacket with only a t-shirt and unzipped it's fine. However, even with just a t-shirt if I zip it up it's too tight (the chest starts pulling and the shoulders become too narrow (you can observe the difference in shoulder placement zipped vs unzipped). Leather jackets are usually worn unzipped but I'm not sure, should I keep or sell? 2. Burberry cashmere top coat- This is an insane coat from Burberry prorsum from a couple of years ago. I love the length (quite traditional, breaks just at the knees). It's too slim to wear over a suit so how would you guys style this? It's black so I feel like it's quite formal, I'm not too sure how to wear it casually.
text:The leather jacket looks too small, even unzipped. Sorry to burst your bubble.	labels:I was afraid that might be the case. It's strange as it's the regular size I wear, but it's just really slim. I'll probably just sell it (doubt I'll lose any money on it)	episode_done:True

I’m terrible at taking care of the leather but they are so cute still end have held up for 2 years of me trampling around. Got them at little burgundy.   I love the slip on vans for work (I have black ones and white ones) and lace up blue ones.  White chucks with the extra half inch bottoms. Gotta replace my missing black and white ones.

text:what do yall wear to the gym (or at home if you work out there)	labels:I'd like to go deeper and talk about fabrics and the clothing in the gym. There are fabrics that leave you soaking in sweat after your routine while some that just makes you feel uncomfortable while running in trails. For my experience I can suggest to use cotton, nylon or polyester.    In terms of avoiding whiff in workout apparels, cotton wins over polyester. This is because studies discovered that it provides less post-workout stench compared to polyester since synthetic fabrics allow the multiplication of stink-causing bacteria.    Polyester is one of the most famous types of workout fabrics that’s primarily plastic cloth. It is efficient as a fitness apparel because it’s durable, lightweight, breathable, wrinkle-resistant and non-absorbent.    Nylon is found in various kinds of sportswear for being breathable and sweat-wicking. In fact, a lot of its users say that it can stand up to even the sweatiest of workouts.    Recently I ordered a cotton T-shirt from True Classic. I can say that it's very comfortable, the fabric is good quality and non-absorbent.	episode_done:True
text:All things K-Fashion!	labels:South Korea has been on my radar for a long time when it comes to fashion. I think I was a pre-teen but I watched Jennifer Hawkins (model, Miss Universe 2004) do a segment on *The Great Outdoors* about Seoul being a great place to shop. I'm guessing this was like 15 years ago... and I thought that's the place to go when I'm an adult, I can buy my own things AND I can splurge.  I think I'm inclined to look to Korea for fashion inspo more so since the Hallyu wave. I love that frilly Victorian look but I've always thought it was classic lady-like look. The details change depending on the trends but I've been rocking that dress with the coat and boots look for years. I loved some of Seri's outfits in Crash Landing. I wish I could pull off Seo Ye-Ji's looks on It's Okay Not To Be Okay (I forgot her character's name despite being 4 episodes in!). I think my current day-to-day style is heavily influenced by the model-off-duty look that I see on the Blackpink girls, as well as girls on insta. I just wish I could be remotely cool in pulling that off. I get the most compliments when I dress feminine.
text:I have a hard time finding truly romantic feminine outfits. Sure, high end French fashion houses like Chanel, Chloe, Givenchy etc. will have silk blouses to die for, but that's not in the cards for me. Even some slightly more accessible ones like Zimmerman, Vanessa Bruno and RedValentino are mostly look from afar!  Then occasionally Frame, Claudie Pierlot, or even Kate Spade or Tory Burch etc. will have something romantically feminine throwback, but honestly even a pan collar is very hard to find.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Do you feel constrained fashion-wise by not wanting to (or being able to) wear heels?	labels:I recently lived in Paris near some of the the biggest tourist attractions, and I would spot Instagram influencers daily. I’d say I’d see them change into heels about half the time. Some folks just commit, but it always stood out as unusual. Paris is not stiletto friendly. Although it’s seen as a formal city, compared to any American metropolis, footwear is casual and out wear is practical. That being said, a 2-3 inch heeled boot or bootie was not uncommon and along with sneakers, the norm.   My most memorable influencer sighting was a very glamorous woman in a tiny yellow dress and heels on a 40 degree (Fahrenheit) day taking pictures on a windy terrace, only to see her minutes later coming out of a public restroom in weather appropriate and casual attire.   I feel like this stuff is dependent on your own lifestyle, and the context of the city. My own comfort level with heels has changed significantly over the past decade, from wearing a heel everywhere, everyday to now owning one pair for parties.  As for non-heeled influencers: there are so many! What kind of style do you gravitative towards?
text:Saw someone doing the same thing in a downtown plaza while leaving work one day. It was winter, probably around 30-40 degrees Fahrenheit.   They were posing in front of an outdoor Christmas tree in a very influencer-winter outfit (long sleeve dress, no tights, heeled booties, and a wide-brimmed hat). She had different clothes sitting with her photographer, and spent about 5 minutes doing different poses.  I always wondered how people were taking pictures in front of Christmas decorations with a light rayon dress, then I saw that. They're definitely not wearing those outfits all day long.	labels:Yeah this is super common! My husband is a photographer and most people do about three outfit changes	episode_done:True

I’m happy to hear that you are impressed with the quality of the sweater.	labels:I really am happy with it. It reminds me of a sweater I tried on at Nordstrom when I had a personal shopper pulling things for me, which I really loved but couldn't justify the price of (I think it was around $300). I'd say the Quince is just as soft and it's definitely thick -- I have another cashmere sweater from Club Monaco that is see through if you hold it up to the light, and the Quince one is much thicker.   I'm glad you liked the silk tee dress -- I got the silk tank with the thicker straps and I didn't find it flattering / wasn't impressed with the material.

text:What Did You Recently Get Rid of From Your Closet (and How, Please Help Me Help Myself)	labels:I'm preparing to move to England in a few months (husband is military) and will probably have about half the square footage there as I have here in the US so am trying to get rid of a ton before we move.  My most effective methods are:  1. Post nicer/trendier stuff that I don't wear often on depop (if I make $ off it it's easier to let it go)  2. every time I buy something new I look at similar things in my closet  to see if I can get rid of something (I thrift a lot so am always getting new stuff)  3. If I have something I think I like but never wear I'll make an outfit around it and wear it for a day to decide if I actually like it 4. Recently I've been setting up the smart closet app which requires photographing everything in my closet and I've pulled a few things to get rid of that are stained or I just realized I don't like that much  I also have a bunch of business casual stuff, I'm just storing mine in a box in the back of the closet cause I don't want to have to rebuy it all if I ever go back to an office.

text:Hiking Aesthetic - Functionality vs. Fashion	labels:Thank you for all the feedback, guys! I may have misworded my question — I always place functionality above fashion when doing intensive hikes (1-2 times a week, 10+ miles with good elevation gain), I more meant inspiration for “hiking/outdoorsy” aesthetic in everyday life :)
text:I'm a pretty serious hiker and backpacker for about 20 years.   My favorite pants are Prana Halle pants. They are cut nicely and have nice, functional pockets. They are also a more durable material, helpful if you take a tumble!  I personally wouldn't wear leggings hiking because I value having pockets and better durability. Also I like that pants allow for a little more air flow.  As far as tops go, it is so dependent on temperature. My best advice (and you may already know this) is to wear a wicking base layer, insulating mid layer, and outer shell if you'll be in cold weather. It's the best way to stay warm and dry.   As far as functionality and fashion go, I've been really impressed with Athleta's recent offerings. They've been able to integrate fashionable cuts with technical fabrics.  Like others have said, Patagonia is one of the best brands for functionality and fashion, but it depends on your individual definition of fashion.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:What are the pros and cons of dressing the way that you do?	labels:Well, I'm a lesbian with long hair and traditionally feminine clothes.   Pro: People assume I'm straight. This means I don't get the constant judgment that comes with looking visibly queer (unlike my fiancée, who we joke is a "50 footer" because you can tell she's a lesbian from 50 feet away). I work in healthcare and live in a politically mixed area, and everyone is automatically friendly to me.   Con: People assume I'm straight. So if I mention my fiancée people assume she's male, and if her pronouns come up I have to have this whole awkward interaction where (at best) they go "Oh--she??? Ohhhhh" and then look me up and down, awkwardly change the subject or ask me invasive questions, and stop being so friendly with me. Also, men hit on me, and women never hit on me.
text:I feel this to a degree. When I was a teen, I dressed super goth/punk but hadn’t come to terms with my sexuality yet. In high school, I got hit on by all the out lesbians and had to constantly explain I was straight. I didn’t figure out I was bi with, like, a super strong leaning towards women until I got to college and my style was very college boho/stoner/art student at a liberal arts college (peasant skirts every day!) My hair was down to my bra line and all the ladies stopped hitting on me.   I kept telling myself after every date with a guy that my next relationship was finally going to be a woman, but only guys ever seemed to hit on me :(   I’m still not sure how I should have dressed in 2005 to attract the ladies but it definitely wasn’t what I was doing.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:When/why did you get your first really fancy purse/bag?	labels:I think I was about 28 when I bought my first Marc by Marc Jacobs purse and I loved it to death (RIP). I had always wanted a blue leather purse and I’d also always wanted an ostrich leather purse and one day I was walking by and saw the blue ostrich leather purse they made and just snapped it up(like 5ish years ago). It was so wonderful to own and it felt special. I think if I had hunted it down and fantasized about the exact purse for a year before buying it, it never would have lived up to the hype, but because I just bought it as soon as I saw it I reveled in it.	episode_done:True
text:What are you hate wearing?	labels:[deleted]
text:For me it's not necessarily a price issue. I like to be sure of what I'm adding to my wardrobe (even if later on down the line I stop liking it) so sometimes it's better to keep something I already own but don't like till I find the right replacement. For example I own a pair of jersey culottes which are great for lounging around the house or running errands in during early summer. I don't love them but I also haven't found another pair of culottes that I like to replace them.  The other big thing is that I am trying to slow down my consumption of fashion so if something is functional, I might keep it a little bit longer.   I definitely agree on not keeping impractical things though. Something that doesn't fit automatically is nixed and something that actively makes me *feel* bad about my body when I wear it doesn't deserve the wardrobe space.	labels:Same	episode_done:True

text:Learning about technical side of clothes - fabrics, care, quality etc.	labels:I think a lot of people here that say their clothing falls apart quickly aren't properly caring for their clothes. Growing up I learned to wash everything together on cold. As an adult I had to read articles and watch YouTube videos on how to care for my clothing. I recommend everyone learn how to properly launder their clothing.
text:I agree, I've never understood what people are doing in the laundry to make their clothes literally fall apart after a few washes. Washing on the hottest setting and drying high heat, maybe?  Ive legitimately never had anything fall apart in the wash ever and I dont take particular care other than cold water and low heat in the dryer (plus not chucking things like sweaters, dress shirts and leggings in the dryer at all). And I used the communal machines in my apartment!	labels:I literally wash everything on hot and dry on highest heat due to dust allergy. My clothes do not fall apart. I'm guessing folks overstuffed the machine for sure. Also not separating by fabric weight is a common mistake. Don't wash denim overalls with bras or delicate, folks. Try to keep similar fabric weights together.	episode_done:True

text:What to do when nothing fits you properly?	labels:I had a similar sort of problem when I was in my teens and early twenties. I have a pear shape and broad shoulders and it was always so difficult to find things that fit well. Getting into the retro/rockabilly style scene really helped. I'm not sure why this is the case, but the clothing tends to be curvier and have slimmer waistlines, which works well for pear shapes.  Even if you aren't really interested in that style, shopping for vintage reproduction or retro styled bottoms could help you find some new possibilities to invigorate your wardrobe.   Also, you mentioned wanting something girlier. You could try wearing your usual tees with a skirt. Usually a circle skirt, skater skirt, or A-line skirt can work well with a tee tucked in or knotted at the waist.   Finally,  learn to alter the waistbands of your pants and add darts to tops, or invest in having a tailor do it for you. Off the rack clothing just isn't meant to fit exactly, alterations are often necessary (even if it is less common for people to actually do it).	episode_done:True

If you want to buy a designer bag, I would buy the Louis Vuitton Felicie Pouchette. It’s $1,130 in the US but if you can get someone you know buy it for you from Europe with VAT back then you can get it for near $1K.  That piece is very versatile as you can use it as a bag or clutch.  Eventually you can buy a leather strap to dress it down.  And the inside compartments are removable so you can double up as a wallet into a different bag.    If you want an investment shoe, I would buy a pair of Manolo Blahniks. They are comfortable and timeless.	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - December 13, 2020	labels:I hope nobody takes this comment as me being an asshole, because I’m intending this to be more of a constructive criticism than that.  But honestly, as someone whose style kind of stagnated somewhere in the mid 2010s, I kind of feel like this sub isn’t very helpful for updating my style, because the sub also refuses to catch up with what’s fashionable.  Like streetwear has obviously captured the zeitgeist for quite a while now. That’s always been an element of my wardrobe. But I feel like I could do better to expand my style and have more options and just in general better embrace trends and incorporate them into my own personal style.  But for the most part this sub isn’t really interested in keeping up. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not expecting this sub to start going crazy for box logos or Supreme or dress like a futuristic cartoon character, if I was interested in that I would actually just read r/streetwear. But I do wish some of the recurring threads and users could offer some inspo in terms of tasteful, grown up streetwear outfits and things like that. But from my perception, MFA is still stuck in early 2010s menswear, J. Crew inspired Americana, or just outright standard business casual. Which is *fine*, it doesn’t look bad, but it’s certainly not fashionable anymore and despite that the default male fashion sub won’t look beyond it, largely.  EDIT: People have been asking me for examples, here’s some stuff that I’ve liked lately, I don’t know that most or any of this is what you’d call “streetwear” but it’s more in the direction of what I’m talking about   Thom Yorke is one of my consistently favorite style inspo sources, he pulls off a pretty good hybrid of tasteful streetwear and classic menswear style I think.  I like this kind of fit he’s worn a lot of the last couple years:   (Actually can’t find the exact pic I’m looking for here so I’ll try my best here)  https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/theoaklandpress.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/1/4b/14bc5350-f6ff-11e8-8bd7-83eb124e2f8a/5c052f56b8ad2.image.jpg?resize=1200%2C800  Usually coupled with one of these Undercover jackets like this:  https://static.stereogum.com/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1161546807-1570042584-compressed.jpg  I think one of the pieces he wears a lot are the Acne Ryder pants, which I kind of like as hybrid classic menswear combined with a more informal, streetwear adjacent vibe:  https://www.nordstrom.com/s/acne-studios-ryder-slim-fit-pants/5146319  I also like Acne in general and I wish I could afford some of these jeans to work into some outfits I have kicking around in my head:  https://www.acnestudios.com/us/en/max-blue-black/B00146-AIL.html?categid=man-jeans  I also like Daniel Lopatin aka Oneohtrix Point Never’s style as well, who I’d say does kind of a more tasteful streetwear thing as well. This press pic is a nice example:  https://dazedimg-dazedgroup.netdna-ssl.com/1400/azure/dazed-prod/1230/9/1239834.jpg  More OPN with bonus Safdie brother: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DOn1aXWWsAAeZSC.jpg  I also like these black denim jackets, chore jackets kind of thing. I have a good Rag & Bone one that I’ve gained too much weight to wear, but these 3sixteen and Rogue Territory ones are nice too and along those lines:  https://www.3sixteen.com/collections/outerwear/products/type-3s-denim-jacket-lightweight-double-black   https://www.rogueterritory.com/collections/jackets/products/supply-jacket-stealth-black?variant=5415637057568  Also along these lines, this Carhartt WIP jacket: https://stagprovisions.com/collections/carhartt-wip/products/carhartt-wip-modular-jacket-ss18  In general I like the use of black/muted or monochromatic colors, I like the idea of drawing influence from punk/hardcore style because I’m into that as well, but I haven’t figured out exactly how to make that work. Also for that reason, I’d like to replace my Red Wings with a pair of Docs, I like the rougher around the edges style better.  I’m gonna trying to keep editing this post, Reddit is kinda fucking up on my phone.

If you watch the daily WAYWT threads, or the best of WAYWT I think it speaks to a departure from those styles you listed. In fact the common complaint on those threads is that "no one dresses like that" and they want to see more business casual etc.  Are you talking about the sidebar?

text:Tailoring for the People	labels:Hi folks -- one of my goals for 2021 is to engage more with my menswear hobby. I am engaging more in online communities (Reddit, Blamo slack), writing a blog, and putting together photo albums. I really love tailoring, but like most people, I don't have that many excuses to wear such clothes in my life. So I put together an album of tailoring worn in a very relatable way.   You will see that the photos are very biased towards a couple sources: the Armoury, Brycelands, and Permanent Style. Also, I have used the phrase "tailoring" relatively loosely. Most of the outfits included have at least one tailored item such as trousers, a sport coat, and/or a button down shirt.   Hope y'all like it!
text:You say at least one item is taylored, what does that mean? Does that simply mean it was altered in certain way?  Just curious if 'tayloring' is a genre.	labels:I think of tailoring as a garment that would be made from a traditional tailor: a suit, sport coat, overcoat, dress shirt, or trousers.

But before it gets to those super extreme sad months, I like wearing a short fitted puffer jacket with a winter down miniskirt over leggings and doc martens.  The short jacket makes me feel like I still have a shape and the down miniskirt keeps my bum warm and looks cute.

Ottawa has a period every January where the temperature dips to below -30 degrees Celsius for a week or two and during that period, if I have to leave the house I'm wearing tights, whatever pants I want to wear, and then sweats on top, plus my winter gear, and the biggest scarf I own, and two pairs of socks.  I would say if you are trying to be cute, the most important thing is having a bag or a locker or somewhere to stash your hat, coat, mittens, and extra layers, and having winter boots that are ok. Ive been wearing blundstones for a few years now and even tho I don't love the look its so much more low key than most winter boots so its worth it. Also, having cute but warm clothes under your winter stuff. No exposed skin!!! Last winter, my go to was a pair of really thick tights and a turtleneck layered under a brandy Melville dress.	labels:I read a whole article that I can no longer find about snow pants being a thing in Ottawa? The article was saying that commuting in snow pants and swishing all around is common in wintersl there. But apparently no where else? Can you confirm?	episode_done:True

text:Help needed for buying jeans online! All advice is welcome!	labels:Tried and true method- if you have a pair of jeans that fit you well, or are close enough, MEASURE THEM. Waist, rise, and inseam. Then, shop for jeans that match those measurements. You can always hem stuff, so I try to search for the rise I want and the waist measurements. I always buy second hand- I used ThredUp. Which, you still can’t feel the material, but, you can search for brands you want and search by rise, waist, and inseam. Hope this helps!

text:What's your fashion tragedy?	labels:We had a moth infestation over COVID. Normally it wouldn’t have happened, but suddenly we both stopped our suit-wearing office jobs and put all of our wool dress clothes, blazers, cashmere sweaters etc. away in a dark corner of our walk-in closet starting in March.   Then by the time we saw a moth flying around in July, the moths had already eaten holes in several items. They love the expensive stuff - cashmere, wool suits, wool coats. Our cheapie casual stuff? Our polyester athleisure? Ha, hard pass and straight for the Max Mara jacket. It cost ~ two thousand dollars in damage (two of my husband’s suits, one of mine, one dress, 3 dress pants, 3 cashmere sweaters, a wool coat); drycleaning, moth prevention and extermination combined. And it took an amazing amount of time - we had to move everything out of our closet, wash, freeze, bake and/or dryclean everything, then I probably purchased every single not-too-toxic pest control item known to man (incl. some moderately toxic bug bombs which we then had to air out our home for a few days). I think I spent about $120 just on garment bags alone. Then the buggers moved to our other closet and we repeated that process for the entry way closet. Finally had the exterminator come twice and it seems to be under control.  Quite honestly a two month nightmare, and no, not covered by homeowners insurance. We managed to get two holes rewoven (a very high level highly technical skill that only very good tailors know how to do and was $60 per hole) on two peices. I learned how to darn and fix holes in looser knits and weaves like sweaters. But god. It was so horrible.  My husband had particularly expensive stuff affected, but actually I lost more because I had more things that were just in the realm of “is this worth $60 to repair and $20 to dry clean?” and ended up deciding no on a few of them so ended up tossing. Also one of my cashmere sweaters, though not cheap, was honestly beyond repair.

text:What inspired your passion/love for fashion?	labels:Honestly, I just love the expression and creativity of it all. I don't follow trends much, but I love clothes. I was joking with my husband just earlier today that he should use some of his new work bonus to get me something new, and he was like, "You already have enough clothes" and to me "too much clothes" - that just doesn't exist, lol.      I have a chronic illness now so some days I just don't have it in me to even get dressed, tbh. But when I do, I often feel like I'm not just getting dressed for the day, I'm putting together a creation that reflects my inner self to the outer world.

text:What's your fashion tragedy?	labels:When I was a little girl (6 or so), I had this beautiful white formal dress. It was a hand-me-down, I think from either a cousin or a neighbour, and had been a flower girl dress. I loved it so much and would wear it around the house all the time and feel so beautiful! And then...I got chocolate on it. 💔😭  My parents wouldn’t pay to get it cleaned, which I suppose is understandable enough, and I still have it and there’s still a stain. I honestly would pay to have it cleaned and wear it around the house now if it still fit me, that is how much I loved that thing. :’(  The “All Eyes On You” dress at Free People in white is very similar to the one that I’ll probably be lowkey mourning forever. I’ve been waiting ages for it to go on sale, because I’m an unemployed student and $98 USD is a lot of money for one dress for me. I honestly might just splurge on it anyway.

text:Women with ADHD & Sensory Processing Disorder: I need Clothing recs!	labels:I've got some sensory issues surrounding clothing, here are my tips:  * Make a sensory friendly drawer or section in your closet with all of your "safe" choices. That way you can retreat to that on tough days. Make sure everything somewhat matches so you don't have to think about it too much. * I like ponte/knit and cotton leggings for bottoms. The cotton ones are thin so I can't feel them, but I have to wear something that covers my front and back because they are a bit sheer. The ponte bottoms I go for stretchy and thick and I can wear a shorter shirt if I want. * I cut all tags off my clothes as a default. * I have a few comfy bralettes and sports bras in my safe drawer for days when I can't do a bra. I did get refitted at r/abrathatfits a few years ago and they helped with my comfort level when I do need to wear a bra. * I love Unionbay brand joggers. The Caylee ones are perfection; I need the black but they've been sold out for months. * I generally don't wear jeans. They trigger my sensory issues and I don't see why I need to force myself if I don't like them. * I have issues with socks. Cotton/nylon/polyamide blends and thin textures are best for me.  * I have a comfy pair of basic black and white Adidas for days when my feet are having issues and I just need comfort. They look good with just about anything. * I stick to cotton, nylon, viscose, rayon, polyester, spandex, lyocell and modal (I think I got them all) for my clothing. Animal hairs and materials are out, I'm allergic anyway. Fleece and fuzzy items are way out. 100% cotton is a no go for me period. It stretches out and sometimes feels tight at the same time.  * I do buy the thin fleece lined tights from Primark (NOT the super cosy). I wear them as pajama bottoms in the super cold winter. I go a size up for comfort and they help with warmth. * I actually like turtlenecks and mocknecks. The security feels nice.
text:[deleted]	labels:I only have a few as that was a more recent discovery (I stayed away from them for years thinking they'd be a no go). I think one is from Uniqlo and the other may be from Primark? I mostly just focus on the materials when I'm shopping for stuff. Mocknecks in particular are quite in now.	episode_done:True
text:Do you have a concept of "Par Value" in menswear?	labels:There's too many metrics of "value" (or 'worth') for a 1 dimensional metric like Par to be useful. You'll spend all your time arguing over how to determine the Par for a type of clothing, and nobody will be wrong.
text:I'm not arguing over it at all, though, I'm just using it as a lens. I focus on quality details, and then tell myself, oh, okay, I'm paying an extra 30% for syling? Or oh, this isn't exactly what I had in mind, but it's 80% cheaper than it should be? Hmmm...  There are a ton of factors left to consider, and I make each decision on a case-by-case basis. I'm not trying to calculate anything. But I find this lens very helpful.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:What’s something you wish you could tell clothing manufacturers to do differently?	labels:Fix arm holes!  Why are they so low? I want to lift up my arms! Like, all the way! Yes, even in coats!  This is why I don't own blazers, and this is why I hate button-up shirts. If I can't perform basic body movements without ruining the entire look, it's not going in my closet.
text:Low armholes kill me! I think that having higher arm holes means the garment will fit a lower range of people off the hangar though right? There's a reason they lower the armholes, and it's an intersection of fit range + profit + cost + effort per garment.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:People with an over the top personal style, how do you incorporate it into your day to day?	labels:Alternative clothing salesperson here: COMMIT. Nothing is worse than half-assing over the top styles. Also make sure it’s cohesive. I have a lot of different styles - punk, goth, witchy, lolita - in my closet, make sure your whole outfit is cohesive and has a “story”. Similar colours, fabrics, or moods. Make sure your hair and makeup match too.  Not to say that like, alt clothing people spring from the ground fully formed, obviously everyone takes time to build a wardrobe and that’s okay too! But imo to really shine it takes a bit more
text:Ugh this is something I'm very self conscious about, I wear alt clothing every day but I only wear makeup 2-3 times per year because I absolutely cannot stand the way it feels. I don't think I look bad when I look in the mirror but I secretly worry that everyone else thinks I look like an idiot.	labels:I have a cohesive alt *only* wardrobe and I rarely wear makeup, the odd editorial look notwithstanding. And when I say “rarely” I mean any at all. I’m not pulling that “mascara and gloss” ‘no-makeup’ bs; I have nothing in my face except chapstick in the winter.   You do not need to wear makeup to pull a look together at all—I get compliments and random street photogs on the regular and my brown, acne scarred face is right there in it.	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - February 16, 2021	labels:Thank you MFA for being a great source of clothing/shopping advice in recent years.  Finding places to buy nice, well-fitting clothes for a tall, very thin guy has really boosted my confidence to the point that I signed up for online dating last year to put my introverted self out there.  I found an awesome woman back around Halloween and we have been dating ever since - Zoom, then in person.  After way too many years, I lost my virginity on Valentine's Day to my amazing and understanding girlfriend!  (Is that TMI for this sub?...)  I'm not very confident in my body, so dressing nice has really helped me take these steps (well, that and xanax...).  I can now justify my closet full of clothes.  Guys, put yourself out there; you never know what could happen until you try!
text:Not TMI at all. That's absolutely fantastic and a testament to how feeling good about yourself can really help you.   I did the same a few years ago. My roommates were badgering me to try and chat to girls in bars or do the online dating thing but I really didn't see why anyone would pick me. Working on myself for a while (putting effort into the way I dress, getting into to fragrances, trying to read more and expand my tastes in films, food etc) really helped me feel less like the student I had been living like for years and more like the kind of person I wanted to develop into. Surprising the effect investing in yourself can have.  I'm delighted that it has worked out for you. Long may it continue.	labels:	episode_done:True

We had a fashion show every month, sometimes 2-3 a month. Moments I looked forward to and were perfect excuses to dress up. Sigh. Good times.  The company filed for bankruptcy mid August and officially closed the doors to our store last month.   I know I won’t find a job like the one I had any time soon, maybe even never. It’s a bit depressing but I’m trying to remain calm and positive.   Now, I try to at least do my hair everyday + mascara and brow gel, but barely have energy to put on a full face.

text:FAQ: What are the different use cases of boat shoes, moccasins, driving shoes, and loafers?	labels:There's so much overlap between all the handsewn types, they're largely interchangeable. A lot of what people will tell you are rules or use cases are largely based on association and nothing really concrete.  Moccasins are a really good first step from "not a sneaker" without being a dress shoe. I find them incredibly easy to wear in most seasons, they pair well with many things that are fairly casual, they're pretty comfortable, and age well.  **Boat Shoes** have negative associations with prep/frats but just by association. In areas other than the Northeastern US (imo) they are much more neutral. No one associates them with frats on the west coast of Canada where I am, for example. But, of course, frats are a fairly uniquely American institution.  They tend to work best in warmer weather as the lower vamp and commonly sueded interior is quite light and good for wearing barefoot. They were, of course, designed to be worn on sailboats, so they're at home around the water and make a good beach shoe.  **Camp Mocs, Ranger Mocs, and Blucher Mocs** all fill a particular niche of being nicely casual shoes that are a bit more refined than sneakers, but pair easily with most non-synthetic casual wear. They make great seasonal transition wear (spring/fall) as they're lighter than boots but can be worn with thicker socks. They also have a variety of sole options from simple leather to treaded Vibram that can be selected for your environment and use case.  If you're used to wearing sneakers all the time, they can be a great introduction to leather shoes - imo in many cases better than boots, as they are often less expensive and easier to wear in many situations.  **Loafers** are often a bit more formal (but not always!) and can transition into business casual/formal wear. Some loafers can be worn with tailored wear (sport coats/suits). It will depend on the exact form, sole, leather, and color. Loafers can also be very casually, having a lot of crossover with moccasins, but again depending on the above factors.

text:What’s some of the best general advice you’d give to someone new to female fashion?	labels:I'm AMAB and haven't transitioned, but have a mostly feminine wardrobe, so maybe what I've learned could be of use.   First thing is about fit and proportions. You can change your visual proportions a lot simply by wearing different items, downplaying parts of your body and highlighting others by switching up the size/shape.  For example, I have thick arms, my hips and waist have (within 5 cm) the same size, I have really round and rather (by female standards) wide shoulders, whereas my legs are thin. So usually (though nothing is rigid in fashion) I like to play up the parts I like, and try and add more of an A-line and structure with a coat that widens around the hips, and that change my shoulder shape. [Here](https://imgur.com/a/Efu9ySm) are three examples of what I mean. So my basic tip would be to try and figure out what you want to promote/downplay on your body, and then look up ways on how to achieve that. If you make a post in the daily thread (or the wiwt thread) outlining your goals people are happy to help you achieve it.

Soft fabrics. I love Hollister jeans...so soft and stretchy, flattering. Fit just right. Perfect rise (I have a long torso).  Puffer coats like Columbia and Patagonia, Eddie Bauer.   Soft sweaters and sweat shirts. I'm loving the ones from Target. Super soft tee shirts, Target sells some with bands on them and they're actually made in the UK. So, so, velvety soft.   Colorful Koala leggings. So stretchy. I hate tight, nonflex leggings that one must struggle with.  Similar to Lululemon.   Loose dresses and tall boots. I dislike tights, again, too "restrictive".   No heels, ever. I cannot stand them. Chuck Taylors, booties, tall leather boots, maybe a little wedge. Love Sorel and Doc Maartin.   No wool sweaters.   Nothing too hot. I get overheated extremely fast. I layer.  I recently purchased a top from Old Navy that has some rough, plasticky (??) thread in it. I nearly cried while wearing it. Incredibly uncomfortable on my neck. Horrible.   I occasionally wear quarter length sleeves in summer, but i wholeheartedly prefer long sleeves. Or short.  The worst is low rise jeans. I was in my early thirties during the whole early aughts rage and with my long torso and slim hips, it was a disaster. In fact, i got written up for wearing too low jeans. I'm a special education teacher! Never again.   I abhor bras. Hate them. Ouch. I'm a devotee to Lululemon and Sugarcandie non wired bras.	episode_done:True
text:Have you ever gone out on a limb and bought clothing from an unknown brand advertised on Instagram/Facebook/online? How did it work out?	labels:Late to this, but I bought a pair of quite expensive jeans based originally off an instagram ad. I saw the ad, was intrigued and did a whole bunch of research..  Turns out the brand is local to me, so I feel even better about supporting a local business, is sustainable, offers free returns, and is made specifically by and for women with a high waist-to-hip ratio (which is me). I saved up and bought them using their online sizing guides only (which are phenomenal). They offer virtual fit consultations, but I've been dealing with tons of anxiety and didn't even want to interact with anyone virtually. 250$ CAD later, and they're the best fitting jeans I've ever purchased and I'm saving up for the narrow leg pair next (I got the straight leg).	episode_done:True

This girl in my class had a sugar daddy who called her in the middle of lecture to let her know he secured a pair at a high end boutique down the street. She left in the middle of class, and CAME BACK before class ended wearing the shoes on her feet! I’ve never seen such disappointment on a professor’s face.

text:What do you think about having a signature style vs. a variety of looks?	labels:I’ve ended up with a style that’s pretty specific but even inside that there’s multitudes. I have jeans and graphic tee looks, big boots and soft dresses, more elegant romantic looks and much sharper almost rigid elements.   I spent some time deciding what elements I wanted all, or most of my clothes/outfits to have and that in its own way formed a style. (Romantic, maximalist, flowing, longer length everything, inspired by particular decades) And in many ways that did make it easier, applying that to outfit concepts (jeans and tees, winter coat choices, wedding guest attire, different footwear, loungewear, the little statement dress, summer looks, winter looks.)   But there’s definitely a flow from one to the next in all of my outfits so that when put together, you can tell there’s something of an overall thing going on (or at least I think so) even if the flared jeans and modern anime tee and doc martens look far removed from the delicate volume sleeve knit and midi skirt with pointy toed boots at a glance. Defining the sliding scale was probably the complicated bit. Going from the most casual interpretation of the look to the most done up and extravagant, and letting occasion wear or what would be workwear if I had a conventional job, just fall into place.   I love so much stuff that I choose not to wear for one reason or another, acknowledging it wouldn’t suit me, knowing that I’m more obsessed with a few outfits than the overall style to go into it fully, I wouldn’t actually be comfortable in the thing etc.   I agree with the top comment saying that it’s easier to dip into fun things you know you won’t commit to full time by changing your accessories, makeup or hair and picking clothes from your regular style that bridges the gap.   In the end it’s up to you whether you really want everything, or most things to fit one or several styles. And some clothing will permanently defy your style if their purpose contradicts it. Romantic flowing weightlifting gear? That’s a nope. It’s the practical ultra high waisted leggings, otherwise almost never worn shoe category of trainers and airy but cropped tee for me. And I mean, I literally customised my trainers to have 'Witch' written on the back inside ankle on each for the fun of it and wear dark colours only, so it’s not impossible to have fun with the stuff you have to wear for practicality's sake but not everything will fit in a style box perfectly and that’s okay.	episode_done:True

text:IMO the difficulties vary a bit game by game, so you may have to tune throughout the run. My friend and I did 2-player co-op of 1, 2, 3, Reach, and ODST. The easiest by far for us was 3, we cranked it to Legendary and still cruised through without many issues. The hardest I think was definitely Halo 2, there were a couple spots where even on Heroic we'd be stuck for dozens of consecutive deaths.

text:How do you shop in COVID?	labels:I did a complete wardrobe overhaul and at first was going to buy my items from regular online shopping like at J Crew and Banana Republic, but then I realized I could find those same items secondhand through Depop. I usually find online shopping to be a pain, but being able to search for specific essentials I need for my wardrobe and also scroll through and find unique vintage pieces made the process really entertaining. It turned out that I enjoyed this way more than regular shopping in stores!   The way I tackled it was I searched for specific items I needed that were essential to me (e.g. black velvet square neck top) and did my best to avoid fast fashion items that I knew weren't built to last. If I needed help visualizing a piece, I asked for a try-on pic, measurements of the bust/waist/hip/length to make sure it fit my body the way I wanted it to, and material content. It's nice too that I'm supporting a small business and oftentimes messaged with whoever I was buying for a bit to ask questions about the item and maybe haggle a bit, that social aspect was nice. Essentially 90% of my closet is secondhand from depop now after shopping over the course of a couple months and I love that I'm in love with every piece that I have and was able to curate each one to suit my needs.  It definitely takes some patience and a good eye for pieces/what materials are best, but I think that's far better than how I originally used to shop and has taught me a lot about how I'm allowed to be picky and absolutely love and enjoy my items, instead of buying things just because it's on sale even though I'm only lukewarm about it. You can find some really good deals and unique vintage pieces while saving money and saving clothing from landfills!	episode_done:True
text:Rant - I'm fed up with fashion and "expressing myself"	labels:There is an expression in my language, "drowning on a spoonful of water". Reading your rant felt like it. Don't get me wrong, I understand where you're coming from.  &#x200B;  There is an intense paradox of "it's just clothes" and also "clothes are a social symbol" existing at the same time and you don't know which to pick because you feel like choosing one makes you lose the other; by choosing "it's just clothes" you feel like you may fall behind in an invisible social race and you worry about the thoughts of others and their treatment of you. By choosing "clothes as a social symbol" you are sacrificing your peace of mind to the whims of an ever-changing cycle called fashion, and what it means to follow it.  &#x200B;  I'm gonna say that nobody really cares about what you wear. To the severity that YOU do, anyway. What matters is an overall presentation: clean clothes, a clean body, a sense of style. "Style" and "fashion" are not the same thing. Fashion is a cycle; Style is how you pick from the endless ocean of clothes and make them "you". Style means understand what you like, and why. Style means being able to work your wardrobe even with limited items. Style means knowing X person would loooooove that pair of shoes, or that cardigan is totally them! etc.  &#x200B;  I have a style. I just use fashion in my favour because at the moment it's really hot for florals, and I am very into florals. So I am super excited for the current selection because it's allowing me to enhance my style. I also loved the vintage/retro boom a few years back. When the style went more athletic, I just kinda skipped. No biggie.  &#x200B;  I would work on yourself a little and figure out your style. Not look at fashion. Look at yourself. Not look at everyone else, either. You are not a slave to clothes.	episode_done:True

I understand that. As to the 20 wears for underwear T-shirts, I might note that I always (have to) wear an underwear shirt to protect whatever I wear on top of it. Most of the time, it is a button down shirt at work. I wash the underwear t-shirt after each use. It may be due to my exceptionally high metabolism, but they really start being rather shabby after 25-30 uses, some after only 20 (especially if worn on hot summer days).   It actually really bothers me that I cannot make them last longer in my work context. When i divest they, I do continue use though as sportswear or garden work or whatever where it doesn't matter that they are a bit shabby.  As of shoes, that one pair that lasted only 50 days were really falling apart.	episode_done:True

For instance, I intentionally never wear American suits (don’t even own one), and instead I wear my Agbadas minus the gown. I keep a full beard and mustache, and I intentionally started to grow free-form locs back then that are now down to the middle of my back.  By no means does my defiance stop there and so I say to hell with them and their baseless stereotypes. Them being any negative party; whether white or a fellow POC (which happens more often than I care to admit). We should have conversations instead of assumptions.

text:Prada FW21 Menswear (Miuccia Prada and Raf Simons)	labels:I can definitely see Raf's Rafness coming through in this collection.   I watched the show live and couldn't help but feel slightly disappointed. It had to do mostly with the fact that the references that Raf uses in his own line were not there. No graphic hoodies or quotes or images. But now I've seen the looks (https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2021-menswear/prada) and have come to terms that the brand is Prada, not Raf Simons. I'm coming to appreciate it more with time, weird saying that just six hours after it debuted. It's a very good start and gives us a peek into how future seasons may be imagined and the amount of input from each designer.   My first impressions were Charlie and the Chocolate Factory vibes with the marbled(?) mint floor, Willy Wonka hair, and purple walls. Along with the music and dancing, it's all kind of a refined rave, no sweat or grime and much better dressed. Then I thought of mid-70s Freddie Mercury when he wore harlequin leotards with the deep V-neck lines, they reminded me of the skin-tight onesies seen in this show. Raf said in the discussion that followed the show that it was a 'sexual cowboy in a saloon' look.   Anyway, I don't really dig those onesies, the bunched up sleeves on the suit jackets, or the double-breasted coats with the big buttons. The knits from looks 17 and 18 are *chef's kiss*, as are diagonal corduroy coats (especially the color in look 37). The bombers are also Raf's thing and I love the design on the ribbing and lining. I'd also like to see the knee-length coats from looks 11, 19, and 20 when not worn under bombers.
text:> the brand is Prada, not Raf Simons  In some ways, I feel like the collection isn't enough Miuccia either. Feels like overall Raf is still getting his toes wet and building out more of a blueprint than it being any realization of a vision. We're getting sort of a starting point of Raf designs using Prada resources, and this feels less cohesive than what you would imagine a collaborative effort with Miuccia and Raf, but I don't hate it.	labels:Raf getting access to Prada's triangle should make for some interesting interpretations in the seasons to come. The way he changed it up and added it to the knits this season reminded me of how he re-imagined the famous I <3 NY to make his iconic design.   Miuccia's sleeves were featured this season, although as I said, I'm not a fan. But I don't know much beyond that, I didn't follow Prada before.   I honestly haven't looked at their first women's season, but menswear is definitely more Raf.	episode_done:True

text:There was a reddit shower thought awhile back about how Dads are like time capsules because they wear whatever was popular / in style when they had kids... as if they just stopped buying clothes and keeping up with trends once they had the first kid.  It seems like mid-20s/early-30s white guys in tech are the same. Based on what they're wearing, you can tell when they first started paying attention to how they dress. And they're all convinced that whatever they wear is timeless or classic, without recognizing that they just bought in to whatever was trending at that time (menswear, minimalism, streetwear, etc.) and that they already are starting to look dated.	labels:[mfa_irl](https://i.imgur.com/VNhyEJ1.png)	episode_done:True

But when I pack I make sure things are all mix and match, sort of a capsule. That doesn’t mean I don’t have a few louder pieces, I just make sure that it will go with a few other things. Like a crazy top can go with pants, a skirt and the jacket. I always have a scarf and hat.   Look into extra baggage from the airline. I often check luggage for work, in excess to my personal luggage. Work pays for it. I’m taking west coast US to India, west coast US to eastern Africa long flights. It is usually around $200US, which is a lot, but for a year it might be worth it you. Also you can ship things via UPS, DHL etc. they do less expensive freight options. I work with people who will ship personal things ahead of them.

text:FAQ: What are people's experiences with clothing challenges like trying not to buy clothes for a year/only buying second hand? What are some tips?	labels:Hmm I'm not sure if this fits your criteria but I tried to only buy 1 thing a month this year (basically anything outside of food or essentials). If I already used up my "slot" for the month, then I would have to wait till the next month before I could buy another item.  Clothing related items I bought this year:   - Boot brush (January)  - NB 993's (April) - Sort of fancy mask (July)  - Lady White T-Shirt (August)  - Orslow pants (Nov)  I found that since I limited myself to only buying so few items in a year, I was able to justify buying more expensive (nicer?) items. Prior to this year I would have gawked at paying $50 for a T-Shirt (that's some ignorant bitch shiiit) but since this was only 1 of 12 things I was buying this year, I was much more open to it.   I kept a "wishlist" of items that lengthened over the year. There were so many that I would end up comparing which item on my list I wanted more (for the month). There were a few times an item on the list went out of stock, but to be honest it didn't generate much FOMO in me, since there were plenty of other items on the list to choose from.     This was probably easier to achieve since we were in quarantine most of the year, but it was a worthwhile exercise. I think it forced me to be a lot more intentional, and grateful, for my purchases.
text:If you don’t kind sharing what were the other items you picked up that weren’t clothing related?	labels:Sure, although I don't know how interesting it is. In addition to the clothing-related items above   - Feb: Shoe Tree (this one is clothing related, don't know how I missed it) - Mar: Cerave Moisturizer - May: MX Master 3 (Mouse) - Jun: Schminke 12-Color Watercolor Box - Sep: Stand for my Cintiq tablet - Oct: Fully Office Chair  As a rough estimate I think the 11-12 items will probably add up to maybe $1000 over the year? Which I think is actually reasonable for a "for fun" shopping budget.	episode_done:True
text:Bernie Sanders' Mittens Won the Inauguration Fit Battle - And you, too, can own your own toasty upcycled woolen mitts.	labels:A similar pair of mittens were made by a school teacher in his state, Vermont, in appreciation of him. But he gave the mittens to a hospital worker who said her hands always got cold on her commute to work. When the teacher saw this she sent ten more pairs to Bernie and said that when she saw him wearing them at the inauguration she was honored because everyone there was wearing world class designer clothes but Bernie was wearing her mittens

text:Where do you get good quality, legit wool sweaters that won't rip/shrink after washing?	labels:Lots of good tips here but I wanted to add, if your husband's sweaters are very scratchy, get Eucalan or Soak and give them a soak, the lanolin softens them back up a bit! You can put it in a mesh lingerie bag and run them through spin cycle, then lay flat and shape gently to air dry.
text:You can also soak them with a water solution mixed with cheap hair conditioner and then rinse a few times. Make sure to pick one that has a scent you won't mind! My grammy used to use a mix of water and olive oil, but that's too messy IMO.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:How do I improve my fashion sense beyond just tshirt and jeans?	labels:Just start accumulating cute tops that look good with your jeans and maybe buy a nice coat and just slowly add nicer pieces to your wardrobe but shoes and jackets can dress anything up or down so I’d focus on those
text:I came to say basically this. Find tops that go with the jeans and skirts or nice pants that can be work with the tee shirts. You don't need a lot of options. Look for pieces that can go with multiple things and start mix and matching. A nice cardigan and/or decorative necklace is also a great way to elevate that simple look with a tee-shirt look into something a little better.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:The joy of cordovan—and how to wear and maintain it	labels:Cordovan is an Instagram dream - it’s lustrous and has a ton of color depth. Unfortunately I find  actually wearing it is a different story. It’s extremely stiff and inflexible, especially during the first 20-30 wears. It’s the coldest leather I’ve ever worn (like my feet are freezing even with medium wool socks). On the flip side, they are super warm in anything over 75 degrees so I avoid them in summer. Spotting in the rain is incredibly annoying so I’ve just avoided wearing them in high temps, whereas my calf boots are completely fine in summer. Also, they are on dainite soles which are terrible in winter snow or slush.   I’m glad I own a pair of color 8 Alden 986, and my Viberg bourbon shell service boots. They are great for certain occasions. But in sum, I have a pair of ~$1300 boots that I generally can wear between 40-75 degrees Fahrenheit when there’s no precipitation or inclement weather. Keep that in mind before you jump into the shell world.

Stop worrying about seasoning it and just cook with it. Use a metal spatula to scrape it down. Fry bacon and eggs and bake cornbread and shakshuka and sear steaks and enjoy!

She nodded in approvement and then told me no one would take me seriously as long as I wore cheap sweaters. I then bought a wildly pretty ivory cable knit sweater and wore it to work and feeling quite exactly like 1000000 bucks AND i had fancy nylons too. She told me no one would take me seriously with my unkempt shoes and that's when I learned the power of a shoe shining kit.  The next day I wore crappy slacks...and, well you know how the story goes.  To this very day I wear natty clothes and shoes so shiney they can blind fleet of Greek warriors.  The only real irony is no one gave a tootie about nylons and yet I still wear them despite all evidence to the contrary....and she threw al hers away after our company got bought out by another and they were no longer required. (I point at my perfectly appointed knees).

text:When will I be "too old" to look cute, cool, hip, whatever?	labels:I can't add anything to whats been said I think there are some great comments here. I don't know what sort of build or how tall you are. I know men who are short, were considered cute when younger and in their fifties have never filled out and even with greying hair are still considered 'cute' and boyish looking.   I've always been really skinny and at 50+ I've been described as cute, I've not changed, physically all that much over the years. I'm lucky, but I've also taken care of myself eating well and taking exercise.

text:How would you describe the quality of self-knit/self-made clothes vs. store bought?	labels:This is a bit of a different perspective on the question but in the last couple of years, I have made a goal for myself to knit/sew as many of my clothes as possible. I have found that for me, these items tend to last longer in my wardrobe than store bought. Not necessarily because of the quality of fabric or construction, but because 1. They fit perfectly - I was able to tailor the clothes to exactly how I like my clothes to fit and 2. I choose high quality fabric and classic silhouettes and styles so they last season after season. If I’m going to spend hours sewing a dress, I want it to be something I can wear for many years!

text:What are your go-to basic fall tops? I’m talking long sleeve tees, sweatshirts, turtlenecks etc!	labels:I'm absolutely a fan of Aritzia's long sleeves and sweaters! It's one of the few places I can consistently find fall/winter styles that don't contain acrylic (which I'm allergic to). One of my absolute favourites is the Only turtleneck—super soft and comfy, but still form-fitting and professional looking if you need to wear it to work. It's modal (semi-synthetic, I think?) but just sooo comfy.  Also a fan of the Alder Thermal (for lounge days / fall hiking) and the Isabelli Sweater (100% merino wool, so nice, soft, and warm). If you wait for discounts, you can usually get all three of these in the $40-$70 range.  For other long sleeves, I usually look at the Banana Republic merino wool collections, Simons organic cotton turtlenecks, Uniqlo merino wool turtleneck, and Tommy Hilfiger cotton sweaters.  Also, American Eagle Soft & Sexy tops are *incredibly* soft and comfy, but I haven't bought from them in a long time, so not sure if the new styles hold up to those from a couple years back.
text:The Only turtlenecks and the TNA long sleeve are staples for me as well. The turtleneck for work wear and the long sleeve for comfy wear. Just an FYI, the Only turtleneck is ribbed, which is hard to tell from the site photos.   After waffling around I finally tried out some of their other basics (sculpt knit and the contour bodysuits) and the quality and fit are spot on. After years of going through similar Zara pieces of lower quality I’ve caved and bought the higher quality Aritizia pieces. They last much longer and are so soft. I also love that they’re thin without being poor quality or too cold, which makes it great for layering.   Recently I bought the [Verdana](https://www.aritzia.com/us/en/product/verdana-top/78480.html) top in Constant Camel, which is amazing quality. The price is higher then you’d normally want to pay for something that’s so little fabric but I’m absolutely in love with it. Looks great with jeans, long skirts, nice pants, blazers.   I’m currently eyeing the [Spa Dress](https://www.aritzia.com/us/en/product/spa-dress/79082.html) and the [Cyprie Dress](https://www.aritzia.com/us/en/product/cyprie-dress/75007.html). I wore the Cyprie sweater I bought at least once a week all last winter and have already started wearing it again this season.	labels:The Contour bodysuit is my absolute favourite and I regret not buying it in more colours when it was on sale! I have my eye on the Cyprie sweater, looks like a good, quality piece that will get worn over and over during the colder months.  The nice thing about Aritzia too is that you can score items secondhand that are brand new or worn once. My city has a massive buy and sell, and everything I've bought there is still in amazing condition (and usually at least half the original price).	episode_done:True

text:Do You Ever See A Cute Outfit, Try To Replicate It And End Up Hating It On Yourself? How Did You Fix That? Did You Ever Get The Answer As To Why It Didn't "Look Right" On You?	labels:>So... I'm in the "body types are crud" camp because I am a "pear" but I have a large bust and broad shoulders. I'm also very short.  So it sounds like you're definitely an hourglass, and I see other people recommend that you check out the hourglass guides (of which there are many).   A lot of bodies map to hourglass in different ways--like if you have broad shoulders and wide hips, or if you have narrow shoulders but a large bust and wider hips etc. etc. It looks though that you're maybe a long-legged/short-torso-ed kind of classic hourglass. There's for sure so so many fit instagram models who are that exact shape--but maybe they only live in athletic wear on instagram?  Instead of looking at what the folks are wearing and taking them wholesale (which def doesn't work for me, I'm also a large busted hourglass and I follow soft girly styled people or really androgynous styled people and both sets of those people are willowy with small perky bosoms and I don't look like them at all).   What does feminine but edgy mean to you? Spiky details? Certain kind of metals, leather, jeans? What are the features of "feminine"? Like what things evoke this idea when you see them on another person? Are they certain colors, is it the way the fabric drapes on them? Is it button detailing or the textures of the outfit? If you can figure out what those things are, you can absolutely replicate them because you know you're not taking the dress, but you're looking for a dress that fits your body made out of the same material, or with the same kinds of details.   That said, on instagram sometimes the whole vibe of a look doesn't actually come from an outfit but how the person is standing or the lighting of the image--those are super traps. The outfit isn't what's being showcased here, the person and the photography skills are. Following people who'll show you the whole outfit on them in a neutral stance (or moving) might help much more, because it's not shot to give you an aesthetic feeling but an understanding of the outfit.	episode_done:True

I have pretty slim hips and wide shoulders and the belt/fit help emphasize my hips/legs. Since they are textured and neutral I can wear them with a slim/lightly textured top. Best of all they are very comfy and can be worn at home or out and about.  Worse: Aerie racer-back sports bra's, they lasted maybe 4-6 washes before I started finding lose elastic threads and fraying around the edges of the bras. I'm not sure if my gentle cycle was too rough, or I got a bad set, but they wore out quick.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 24, 2020	labels:What clothing should I wear to make my shoulders appear smaller?
text:You generally don't see a lot of clothing specifically designed for that purpose, and I'm not totally sure why you'd want to, but...  Avoid jackets with heavy shoulder padding. A natural shoulder can kind of accentuate the shoulder, but at least it won't exaggerate it.  Get jackets and shoulders that are wide in the body, so that the drop from shoulder to body seems less dramatic?  Large scale patterns make your body seem a little smaller, maybe. Since you're worried about shoulder width, you could try large horizontal scale and small vertical scale, if you find something like that.	labels:>You generally don't see a lot of clothing specifically designed for that purpose, and I'm not totally sure why you'd want to, but...

The other ([Mode](https://www.us.allsaints.com/men/sweaters/allsaints-mode-merino-open-cardigan/?colour=107&category=10)) is slightly more expensive at the main Nordstrom store, but with price-matching, works out to be the same price as Nomo.

text:What’s your opinion on (modern) 90s-inspired fashion?	labels:I've been building out a [Pinterest board](https://www.pinterest.com/julieannie0729/fashion-daydreams/middle-school-fashion-goals/) all of last year to prep for this.   I fully embraced tie dye in the 90s and I spent summer making a lot of new versions. I find my patterns more abstract, a touch more pastel, but also doing a bold black here and there. I am not cool enough to pull off what 1997 me wished she could wear/afford but just because I'm 35 now doesn't mean I give a fuck any more than I did then, when I was also trying to be Claudia Kishi kind of fashion and looking a hot mess. I like shiny flashy rainbow things and that's that era in every way.	episode_done:True
text:What are some habits that keep clothes/shoes new vs that habits that ruin them?	labels:I don’t buy acrylic sweaters anymore no matter how much I like the style. They pull and look awful so quickly. I have a $15 sweater shaver and use it every winter season on my sweaters. It makes them look almost new again.
text:I have found there is something to be said for an acrylic of higher quality. I wear a cardigan almost every work day, and the acrylic, when washed on warm and line dried, last alright. But they never see the inside of a dryer.	labels:I don't think I have a scent, but whenever I wear acrylic, I don't smell so fresh.

text:BoF: J. Crew's New CEO has a Survival Plan: Edit out the Ugly	labels:i just feel like their price points are so high and the quality can be kind of mediocre. they’re stuck in a weird place where their pricing is too expensive for the average consumer who’s trained to expect bargains and too cheap for someone who buys luxury or higher end pieces.   even with their random extra 50% off sales, it’s still above what people expect to pay. but then again, madewell is thriving. (though i think that has more to do with being able to capture an on-trend aesthetic.)
text:I'm a J. Crew loyalist, so I'm acknowledging my potential bias but I'm also a fan of Banana Republic and went through a hardcore BR phase. However, I've kind of forsaken Banana (my young professional wardrobe was full of it) and returned to even more J. Crew -- I've found that, in general, my pieces from J. Crew last longer and hold their shape/quality more than what I have bought from Banana. Also those 50% sales are usually goldmines for me! Just my experience!	labels:Are you me?	episode_done:True

text:What did people *actually* wear in 2000's?	labels:Well most cycles of fashion is a new take on an era, not an exact replica, so authentic 2000s wouldn’t be in style, but a 2020 take on it would.   I was in college and we wore low rise flares and tight fitting long tops. I mean, we wanted to look like we had the longest torso and lowest butt ever!!! It was a time to be alive. We wore shiny shit to the clubs and our moms told us not to look like we were wearing our jammies because it was all lingerie-looking.   We lived for a layered look but a fuckin stupid one, like a cami over a t shirt. Or a scarf with a tank top.  I even wore a skirt over JEANS and they were flared wtf.

text:What do you think about having a signature style vs. a variety of looks?	labels:There is absolutely nothing wrong with having several styles that are irreconcilable—It's not a marriage, haha!  It's very occasion-specific for me, but I bounce between a sort of slouchy/neutral/whatever style with denim and chunky knits, to athleisure/"hiker chic," to all-black business formal. Most of the pieces that go to each style don't cross over at all.    I have found it easiest to have the bulk of my clothes fit into my favorite style, that way I have a lot of options for it, but you're right, they are just clothes, and they should express whatever you want them to, or serve you in the way that you need them to. We do seem to hear constantly about "so-and-so's style," or "developing your personal style" a lot, and it's always mentioned in the singular, which does imply that everyone just gets one.   So, I wouldn't say I'm "all over the place" per se, but I definitely don't force myself to don jeans and a cute cardigan when I'm feeling joggers and a fleece. Or slacks and a blazer, for that matter. Just enjoy your clothes :)

I try to keep the colors for the bottoms black or beige, and the tops turquoise or purple, so that everything goes with my daypack!  Basically, think a Patagonia catalog.

text:Theres massive variation in suits, cut, padding, drape Etc... all effect fit. Sizing down with large shoulders is a bit differnt though, usually you go up. What's the difference between over and under arm measurement? What suits are you trying? I'd be curious how a slim or extra slim suit fits. Also is this like off the rack or having it tailored?	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Your thoughts on leopard print (and animal prints in general)	labels:I don’t enjoy animal prints on myself, but I think that’s because I don’t enjoy prints in general. I tend toward solid color clothing, and then add interest with texture or hardware over pattern. The only thing I have in my closet that have any type of pattern are shoes, because I make custom sneakers for myself.   If you like leopard then rock it. I think there are a lot less stereotypes embedded with clothing these days, but maybe that’s just the area I live in right now. Especially with the popularity of 90’s trends and thrifting, I think people just like to see creative mixing and new combinations.	episode_done:True
text:Dress Sneakers Are Alarmingly Popular	labels:Dress sneakers never look good for the intent that the wearer is going for and this is the hill I'm willing to die on.
text:I have a similar pair to [these](https://putthison.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Untitled-1.jpg) in a navy color, and I think they're great for a business casual environment with darker jeans and a sports jacket, but that's just me. Hate business attire in general so it's the best of both worlds.  The leather/glossy material dress sneakers though are an abomination and should be burned.	labels:Why not just wear mocs with a rubber sole?	episode_done:True
text:What will be obsolete by summer 2021?	labels:Mom jeans? I don't know why they came back in the first place.
text:Just as a reaction to skinnies. The trend started with low waisted skinnies, then the waist rose and rose, to the point that high waisted skinnies were in, and now we're moving away from the skinny, tight look to a looser one. I'm not convinced mom jeans are going to dominate the next decade like skinny jeans did, but I'm positive that whatever trend takes over will have looser legs. I do hope mom jeans stay though, they're so comfortable.  E: spelling	labels:I hate mom jeans. What do you wear them with?? I'm petite but with a large chest, I cannot find any nicely fitted tops. I feel like all the tops in stores are boxy and loose. Loose tops and loose pants together looks... messy and disheveled to me. I'd love to know how you style mom jeans.	episode_done:True
text:Oxford cloth button downs: a short historical inspo album	labels:i never understood why it's one clothe that is always recommend on the web
text:It's got texture and the mix between white and other colour threads is fantastic and can help tamp down some bolder colours e.g. yellow, the collar roll on a good Oxford is beautiful, the fact it is a button down collar means it doesn't collapse without a tie so it's easy to wear under a jacket casually, it can easily sit underneath a fuzzy Shetland or a soft thin cashmere jumper and not look out of place in terms of visual weight.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do comfort vs. style compare in what bottoms you wear?	labels:I wear lots of skirts, high waisted jeans, and yoga pants because I think they're flattering and comfortable. I have to find a balance between style and comfort because if something is too much one way, I feel miserable.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else have “irony pieces”?	labels:Once my cousin and I went to a store with her mom and were amused by all the ugly clothes. We made a game of finding the ugliest shirt we could for each other and trying them on. She picked out a hot pink leopard print one for me, I tried it on, it was surprisingly cute as hell and became one of my favorite pieces in my closet.	episode_done:True
text:Review - The Custom Russian Automatic Dive Watch (for less than 100 Dollars)	labels:Ahhh yes, love the Vostok Amphibian. Has a little bit of a cult following over on /r/watches and rightly so. A super cool diver with tons of customizability at a fantastic price tag.  Also, look into the engineering of the watch when you get a chance. They have a very different, but effective approach to water proofing.  Here's mine: [https://i.imgur.com/ehc68j3.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/ehc68j3.jpg)
text:Where do you get them?	labels:So I got mine on ebay. You can find an amphibian for about 70-80 USD but it ships from russia. This one in particular I got from a US seller but they were charging 95.   Meranom is a Russian watch shop I believe where you can also order, most people go that route from what I'm told.	episode_done:True
text:What to do when nothing fits you properly?	labels:First, I do have some questions for you:    Which kind of items would you like to wear?   What style would you like to go towards? (I can't get much information from jeans and basic t-shirt)   Do you have a small waist? (this question goes towards if pants/jeans that fit you in the butt and thighs have a wide gap at the waist)   Are your legs "too long" for normal-sized bottoms? (regarding if you need tall sizes for jeans)   With your chest and shoulders, do you often have the issue that you need to size up to have correct shoulder hems but then the clothing item will be too wide in the chest/belly area?  Once you answer, I can give you some suggestions.
text:Thanks for the reply.  I usually go towards a more casual style, for example my usual outfits consist of slim jeans/mom jeans and a graphic tshirt. I think I tend to like this style more because slim jeans hide my knock knees better and graphic tshirts make my flat chest less obvious. I don't like tight clothes because I don't feel comfortable in them. And because of my body type/size, I just think any piece of clothing that is fancier, just makes me look like I'm trying too hard so I avoid them.  (I thought the question said "What kind of style do you go towards", sorry hah!)  But to answer your question, something similar to my current style but that looks more flattering on me. Maybe something "girlier" too because literally all I wear is round neck basic tshirts and sweaters.  My waist is normal I guess, though I do have a gap of 3-4 fingers at the waist while wearing jeans. And yes, my legs are usually too long for most jeans but I think it's because of the available clothing in my country; until recently ankle length jeans were really popular and ofc those were very short on me. I have managed to find some decent fitting jeans for now. Regarding my shoulders, I think what you described is exactly what happens. I wear size 38 (Europe) or M and these fit well at the shoulders but they are quite wide otherwise because my chest is flat, like I could probably fit another person underneath. And to answer the redditor below, I live in the Balkans! I hope my answers are somewhat helpful.	labels:As someone who is literally 150cms tall with short legs, I would kill your long legged and tall bod. You mentioned wanting to look a bit more girly, what about a long skirt (they can be high, low or medium waisted) and a crop top, (long or short sleeved, turtleneck, halter) .. I feel like that outfit would really suit you because you're tall. Or a simple skater dress or hoodie and shorts or skirt and some cute sandals or even those high top converse. They usually look amazing with long legs, regardless of what kind of knees the wearer has	episode_done:True

text:Yearly Aesthetic Goal Setting	labels:I have never seen this done before, but think it is a fascinating way of doing things, and one that I'm keen to try.   I live in a place with a lot of seasons, so wondering if maybe two different ones will work best for that? I don't want to be "restricting" myself now for 2021 summer. How do you manage that..?  Over the past few weeks, I've gotten a bit bored with my clothes and what I was wearing (hello lockdown fatigue). So I've gone through my closet, honing in on what I like, dumping what I don't (to charity shops), selling items of value and considering what I want or need to fill the gaps in my wardrobe. It's a fun process, and I honestly think this came at exactly the right time for me to undertake the exercise. Thanks for sharing!
text:I do not live in a place with many seasons, so I can't speak from any real experience here, but I would personally still maintain one yearly board with a variety of seasonal clothes. I would also think about what my plans or goals are for that season (i.e. travel plans, important holidays or birthdays, starting school, new job, etc.) and then arrange the board so that it flows seasonally like the actual year.   In regards to feeling restricted, I think of it more as "focused". For my personality, adding limits and focused restraint is a good idea. For you, it may not be. I am still open to the idea that 2021 may look completely different. After all, my 2020 board did not feature any sweatpants but you better believe that has been my most worn clothing this year!	labels:I think that's a really good approach, thanks for the response. It has definitely given me a lot of food for thought.	episode_done:True

text:What are some habits that keep clothes/shoes new vs that habits that ruin them?	labels:I just want to say that this thread is what we should point to when someone is like "I'm young (or not young) and don't have a lot of money but I want to do a sustainable wardrobe, help!"  We've been sold the American idea that sustainability is about shopping and sure, that's one angle, but only one.  So much of it is about what you do and skills you can build.  Invest some time in learning laundry, care and repair techniques, its free to learn.  Then the stuff you love lasts longer, wallet is happier, "investment pieces" become more attainable since you can trust yourself to have nice things, less eco impact, and a partridge in a pear tree.  Things I wish I knew 20 years ago:  I used to never care for shoes or polish them or anything. They would sort of wear out at a certain point and I thought that was that. I didnt know you could resole shoes, or maybe I had some vague notion but a shoe repair place seemed kind of intimidating or maybe just for guys in business suits and wingtips. Then I learned to clean and polish them regularly, and resole my good pairs every two years or so and OMG.  They last so much longer, look so much better, and I learned that the polish keeps the actual shoe protected from dust and debris etc so if I polish regularly I keep that stuff off the actual shoe.  I also learned that you can get almost much any stain out if you run it under cool water immediately, before it starts to set.  Blood, wine, paint, etc.  Likewise oil, grab a little dish detergent or hand soap or whatever you can access and gently handwash that sucker before it sets in.  Prevents having to do a lot of heavy lifting with stain removers later.
text:My hairstylist friend also taught me that hand sanitizer or isopropyl alcohol can get pretty much any stain out of fabrics, especially hair dye. I’ve also used it to get a set in hair dye stain off a white countertop :)	labels:I used hand sanitiser to get pen ink out of a work top a couple months back, it was the only thing on hand and it did a brilliant job.	episode_done:True

Yeah, it definitely feels like we're a little underserved, but hey, I guess there's more variety in women's clothing than in men's and androgynous options, so it makes sense!	labels:true. but it’s 2020 you’d think someone would have done something by now!   i don’t shop there but i hear ASOS has a pretty impressive range of sizes and inseam lengths. they might be a good place to check out.	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 28, 2020	labels:Looking for the "ultimate" Hermés Tie  Hey Guys! I will keep it as short as possible: As a student, I don’t have much money to spend on clothing, so a tie by Hermés is somewhat a bigger investment, because I can’t spend 180€, every time I want/need a new tie. Therefore, I am looking for something that lasts. I have heard that ties by Hermés are of very good quality and are somewhat worth the money (I also want to give myself a little treat :)). But the tie shouldn’t only last quality-wise, but also in terms of style. So far I own black, dark gray and navy suits and only two ties: a navy one and a burgundy/maroon one. Both have no patterns and are of one color each. Honestly, I am getting a bit bored with those. Do you have any suggestions on a Hermés Tie, that has a pattern, maybe more than one color and matches several suits? I actually only wear white shirts underneath, so it should be matching to those (if it is able to match different colors of shirts, that would be great, but it is not a necessity). Btw: I am 20 years old of white skin and blond hair (if that even matters). I am pretty new to suit fashion and I honestly don’t want to pay that much money on an expensive tie, only to realize, that it wasn’t matching my outfit. I am really looking forward to your replies!
text:I would urge you to buy a few less expensive ties that are still nice which you can mix up. There is no difference in quality from a $50 tie to a Hermès tie.  That said, a green one would look like with the blue suit.	labels:Thanks for your answer! I will definitely will take that into account.

text:How different is your actual heel length vs what it's advertised as and, how much does it change by shoe size for you?	labels:If the heel height is graded for size the angle of the footbed should remain constant between sizes.   IME wearer weight, fitness, and tolerance for discomfort play a more significant role than anything else. I’m 176cm, IT38, wear heels more than is probably good for me, and can comfortably manage a 100-105mm pump sans platform to dinner, and 85mm or so for days at the office if needed. With an enclosed wedge or block heel style I can easily do ten miles of walking at the same height, more with alcohol ;) I’m a former rock climber and lifelong endurance athlete, so discomfort and chafing are not foreign to me. Even the worst heel is much more comfortable than trying to jam a thin crack! I have former dancer friends who report a similar experience, while other less grin-and-bear-it types find anything more constrictive than Uggs unbearable.   I drop weight in the late summer and early fall for races, and even the 2-3kg shift makes a huge difference in comfort.	episode_done:True
text:What will be obsolete by summer 2021?	labels:I know I'll get alot of hate for this, but leggings are NOT pants.

But I always thought it was weird when adults where leggings like they're pants. I know they're comfortable but I don't think they should be considered "fashionable" imo.   Leggings look cute on toddlers tho.

text:Teach me how to successfully shop secondhand please!! Or just commiserate if it’s hard for you too lol.	labels:Both work really well if you either, a) know what you're looking for or, b) are really willing to experiment.    For the former, browse fast fashion websites and get an idea of what you like and the words associated with it, to use as search terms. Physical thrift stores will also be less overwhelming if you have an idea of what you want, even if it's just a color, occasion, or fabric.  Personally, I travel with an extensive, detailed list I tend to stick to, but I'm still sometimes waylaid by a truly excellent print, or anything that feels like especially good quality.    Getting good at eyeballing your size, and having a good idea of what shapes work best for you is also helps a lot.  The best way to do so is to try on a ton of stuff, which is practically required when you're experimenting, unfortunately, considering that it can be somewhat impractical/ill advised nowadays.  Additionally, just like having a go-to grocery store, it's worth finding a spot you like and sticking to it.  Building familiarity definitely helps to keep from feeling overwhelmed, and it'll give you a frame of reference when you hit up other places (and, if you get really intense about it, you can make a pros and cons list for all the thrift locations in an hour radius so you know what you'll have the most luck finding in each one...)	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - November 26, 2020	labels:/unTimeless At this point I think my problem isn't with slim-fit, it's with the low-rise it usually comes with.

text:Why do people like heavy keyboards?	labels:in a practical sense, it can help so that your keyboard doesn't move around so easily. Not that "normal" keyboards just fling around when you use them, but it just somehow feels more stable when typing. Typing experience is a weird thing and some people are really particular about the little details....just like clothes ;)	episode_done:True
text:What are your tips for dressing a big chest!	labels:I like square necklines and wrap tops. One thing I’ve found is weirdly the bigger the cleavage of my tops, the less big my boobs look. So no turtlenecks
text:Never been brave enough to try a square neckline, I'll give it a shot!	labels:Seconding this. Open necklines (as in horizontally, not necessarily vertically) work best for me. Also the bra you wear matters a lot. Even with a larger bust size, you really shouldn't have cleavage in a correctly fitted bra unless your breasts are very close-set. I find that I like an unlined balconette style best, it doesn't accentuate size/shape like a molded/padded bra and it helps maintain separation. I do find *any* bra makes my bust look larger, though, so sometimes I'll wear like a slightly compressive cami sans bra for a more subtle look if braless works for the situation/outfit.  ETA: A couple more things!! For button-ups/blouses, I never buy ones with a collar unless it's like a Mandarin collar or mock neck. I find traditional collars create too much bulk in that area. And when I do wear something that doesn't have an open neckline, I opt for something with a looser/flowier fit over the bust *but* cinched in at the waist (which could just mean tucking into a high-waisted bottom).  ETA 2: Another comment reminded me, but I also second shoulder details. A little extra volume or visual interest at the shoulders can def help visually balance the bust.	episode_done:True
text:What's the craziest item you've bought during quarantine?	labels:Pink and blue dye leggings from HSN (WVVY is the brand).

text:Does anyone else feel that nothing is unfashionable nowadays?	labels:Hmmm... I dont agree with the no defining silhouette. I would say a lot of decades have more than 1 silhouette as a defining style (early 60s and late 60s are super different; same for early and late 1990s ); 1920s had a mainstream look vs the flapper look; etc). And for this decade I can think of two silhouttes that defined the decade for me.   One is the Kim Kardashian/SheIn style - long skin-tight dresses/skirts down to the calves or so in neutral colors. It was popular from like 2016 to 2018, with some bleadthrough until now, although personally that style is unflattering on me (I'm short and dont like things that cling at the waist).   As for the early 2010s, I can picture that kind of Zooey Deshanel, "New Girl", with the 50s kind of flared A-line skirts, bright colors, with maybe polka dots on them, and paired with like blouses, and a hair bandolete.  I think the current style (straighter lines and earthy tones) will be more remembered as an early 2020s thing.

text:General Discussion - December 23, 2020	labels:Oh trust me, I will gatekeep because it’s proved to be the only way to ensure the existence of standards.  And I don’t care about what you say you are. Fedoras/Dusters/Capes/whatever is not just clothing. It’s an entire lifestyle and subculture that you are unlikely to be privy to or even fit into if you lack the euphoria and pedigree. That’s just the reality.  You’re probably one of those people who believes anybody can be anything yada yada yada. Sorry to break it to you, but no matter how much I want to be, say, a gentlesir, it simply isn’t going to happen. I can don the wolf shirts all I want, but it doesn’t change the fact that because it isn’t who I was born, it’s something I’ll never be. The same goes for most of the people on this subreddit who, by most accounts, even detest and reject the trappings of class that can not be divorced from euphoria. It is a style of, by, and for the American lower basement class and below, and nothing you say will change that.   It’s literally a costume for most of the people on this sub, and frankly, it’s subversive and I despise it.
text:Given the fact that you are a mod-level "Consistent Contributor" participant on this sub voicing such an opinion, I'm not sure I can take MFA seriously any longer. Allow me to explain from a position with respect to which I will pwn 99% of the good people subscribing to this sub, then extended things back to the present situation.  I like and can confidently say that I know watches. By no means am I an aficionado of the caliber of [spedmonkey](http://www.reddit.com/user/spedmonkey), [zanonymous ](http://www.reddit.com/user/zanonymous), [ArkJasdain](http://www.reddit.com/user/ArkJasdain), or even MFA consistent contributor of yore, [Liberalguy123](http://www.reddit.com/user/Liberalguy123), but I know the gist of my crap. I can tell you the relative merits of hesalite, mineral, hardlex, and sapphire crystal depending on intended use. I can tell you what on earth a tourbillon was meant to accomplish, why accutron mattered although nobody uses the technology now, how to read a tachymeter, and why Rolex beats Omega nine times out of ten. I can explain why automatic and mechanical movements are so much more highly respected by your average watch guy than quartz but why Citizen's Eco-Drive and Casio's G-shock get a pass. If you try to put anything other than an uncomplicated, sub 40mm watch with a black strap on your wrist before attending that black tie affair where you need to impress those people in order to do that special thing, I'll warn you like a bro. I can articulate in detail the quantum leap between a Panerai and a Vacheron Constantin, I can suggest a half dozen watches for whatever your price range and fashion context given some description of your sense of style, and I can do other stuff whose articulation would make this comment even longer and more boring than it may already be.  Given all this, I think I have quite a bit to contribute to MFA on the topic of watches. Yet it kills me to see this sub ceaselessly harp the relative merits of a Timex Weekender versus a Timex Easy Reader as the go-to "wrist clock" accessory every other day--as if this were the end all, be all starting point for legit conversation about watches. It kills me to witness people seriously discuss whether this Fossil goes with that suit, let alone how they got this totally great deal on an Invicta that looks just like the watch in that one James Bond film on MFA. (I mean, holy crap, [Invicta even made shujin's "Unofficial Noncomprehensive Approved Brand List" five months back](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/me39q/shujins_unofficial_noncomprehensive_approved/); if you don't find that startling, please let me know so I can spare you both some major embarrassment.) As a guy who actually knows watches, it kills me to see such wild misses over and over and over again on MFA with the slightest departure from what is becoming the received tradition provoking a barrage of trollish downvotes devoid of substantial discussion. I was initially encouraged to see [polerawkaveros's call to arms on how to improve the sub a couple months ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/pm1oc/contrary_to_popular_belief_mfa_isnt_full_of/), but virtually every single time I come on this board lately, it is not just a circlejerk such as commonly afflicts other growing subs--it is a swirling, merely opinionated echo chamber of progressively greater ignorance.  Case in point, please take a look at the state of this thread right now. I try to add-value, to unpack a clear, logical argument for every point I make--frequently with multiple citations to back up my claims. This is not merely stated opinion; this is opinion fortified with hard data that will at least enrich the conversation even if one totally disagrees with it. Over half of these comments are downvoted with no substantial rejoinder; the most upvoted comments offer opinion with no basis in fashion substance. Let's parse your response, for example:   > not a lot of this translates over to modern clothing  All of this is modern clothing by definition since we're talking about a photo taken in 1963. Perhaps you meant to say "contemporary fashion," which you could easily have defined according to some set of principles. Which you didn't do.  > Hell, I dont think thats even a good take on the porkpie for the time.  Care to elaborate? [Here's a comment I left with eight different examples of pork pie hats across a variety of contexts](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/tlgbb/as_per_yesterdays_discussion_about_hats_sammy/c4nnz3w) with an additional blog post citation, presently sitting at an even balance of up and downvotes with tripe for a rejoinder. At least do me the favor of substantiating your claim with one freaking better image! I mean, you must be comparing this in your mind to something from the mid-1960's, right?  >  get what you're going for, but this same argument could be applied to togas ("As per yesterday's discussion, Lucius Cornelius Sulla will teach you how to rock a Picta") or just about any other historical clothing item.  Your form of argument here is a bit difficult to discern, but I think you're saying that pork pie hats are so wildly outdated that you would double-take just as hard if you saw someone walking down the block wearing one in earnest as you would if you saw someone walking down the block wearing a toga in earnest. In that event, *Great Scott, man, are you serious?!?* [You see the spitting image of Soctrates in this shot of Justin Timberlake sporting a pork pie hat](http://imgur.com/2Jdks)? When you checked out that sweet, Tom Waits retrospective in Magnet's February 2010, [you wondered how they fabricated such an accurate digital painting of Quintus Horatius Flaccus?](http://imgur.com/EP2TC)? You figured GQ must have gone for some Bronze Age throwback shtick since they kept mounting pork pies on [Bruno Mars's](http://imgur.com/nVHVd) freaking [dome](http://imgur.com/iQAa9) over and [over again](http://imgur.com/XKXkW)--because who could ever take *that* ancient historical item seriously?!?  Look, I'm not saying all this to try to be a jerk or to hate on MFA or the various respondents in this thread. But--check it out, this is the hilarious part--I am total noob at haberdashery and don't even like pork pie hats all that much! Still, I can easily substantiate my claims more thoroughly on this topic than pretty much anybody else who responded. If I can do that with something I barely know the first thing about (like pork pie hats) just as well as I can with something I know thoroughly (like watches) with little more than a heap of opinion in response, I'm seriously concerned that my days are numbered on this sub.  This is a rant that's been building up for a while, and it says far more about my frustration with MFA in general than anything you or anyone else has mentioned in this particular thread. (Predictably, I learned mid-way through typing this comment that the one, general purpose style blog voted off the [recommended block from the MFA's v2.0](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/p6exh/style_blogs_v20/) literally just released a series on [recommended spring/summer headwear by Stetson featuring--yup, you guessed it--multiple pork pie hats](http://www.thestyleblogger.com/5123/springsummer-headwear-featuring-the-sb-team/).) At any rate, I hope you see where I'm coming from and at **least** back up your random comments so I can learn something from your opinion and not just bat away limp criticisms without substance.

text:Lol, am I the MTM expert now?  For **shirts**, Spier and Mackay stands out in price -- starting at $59 with 20% off sales and 20% off your first order with referral code. Proper Cloth is a sub favorite, but costs $100 per (as do most competitors, roughly -- Luxire, Alton Lane, Black Lapel). SuitSupply's current custom tier is $100, but they work very hard to confuse you about whether that's MTM or not. (Spier is also a standout because they technically make you a custom pattern, which brings it one notch closer to being bespoke, but that's not a big deal in itself given it's online measurements and remote manufacturing).  For **Suits**... Spier's online MTO program is not really MTM. SuitSupply still tries to confuse you. I like my Black Lapel suit. They start at $500... And I hear their remake policy no longer offers returns, but still unlimited remakes... Oliver Wicks starts at $600 and gets good reviews. You ideally want in person MTM, but for that, you have to tell me what the closest city is. If that city is not New York, you won't have a ton of options. If it is New York, I could write a book on it.  For **outerwear**... overcoats are expensive. Black Lapel makes some. Craftsman Clothing makes suede jackets. Yeossal makes chore coats at $200 and safari jackets at $300, which is pretty good, but you kind of just need to put the measurements you want into the comments and hope for the best, it's not the most comprehensive MTM system, they call it MTO but it's somewhere in between what you'd call MTO and MTM.	labels:	episode_done:True

The Rush and Sabre are more ski specific shells, with the Rush being more big mountain specific and the Sabre more generalist. As everyone else has said it's smart to get a shell and layer under depending on conditions. I personally do all my skiing in Outdoor Research shells since I like the stretch and don't find I often need the protection of a full Gore-Pro Arc shell. But they done have the same crisp look of a dead Bird so I don't ever wear them casually.	episode_done:True

text:People with an over the top personal style, how do you incorporate it into your day to day?	labels:I dress like a bit of a lunatic. It was a journey for me. More than a decade ago I discovered vintage by way of repro and fell head first into the scene.  I started with a colour palette so I could reset my style. For me it was shades of blue, white, grey and red. All these colours go together so I focused on only buying things in those colours until I was more comfortable with my look and then it progressed from there.  Over the course of a decade, I dressed mostly 40s-50s and also learned to sew which gave me a lot of freedom with creating the looks I wanted. I sewed from vintage patterns. My hair was bright red for this time but I have a straight blunt bob with a fringe so never really nailed the vintage hair (hates being curled).  In the last 4 years I've slowly moved away from the more strict vintage look and branched out into more modern styles. My hair is now either pink or blond. I wear mostly pink, green, blue and paler yellows as they all go with my hair. I wear less florals but I like any prints with LEAVES (tropical shit makes me froth), and have a bit more of a sporty/edgy/raver style eg floral dresses with sneakers, or bright pink pants and knitted tops.  The mainstays have always been the bright colours that coordinate with my hair. This is easy to incorporate into any look from casual to high glam. Eg, one of my most basic 'cant be fucked getting dressed' outfits is a knit pencil skirt from Free People and a crop knit jumper (sweater? for you americans) and my Adidas Superstars. Feels like I'm in my pajamas - except the skirt is neon yellow and the top is pale yellow and the shoes have gold metal toe-caps - which all looks pretty hectic if my hair is either blond or pink.Whereas a glam look (cos the last time THAT happened was my work Christmas party), was a slinky shiny pale green slip dress I made, my gold jewellery, and a multicolour pair of Loeffler Randal Penny mules - fairly simple but still the colour themes are what fits my style and the shoes are insane so that balances out the slip dress.  So I feel like, if you have the core ideas that define what your style is, you can include them no matter what occasion you are dressing for.  Wooooo that was LONG     Edit: you can creep my profile for some of the shit I've made

text:Do You Ever See A Cute Outfit, Try To Replicate It And End Up Hating It On Yourself? How Did You Fix That? Did You Ever Get The Answer As To Why It Didn't "Look Right" On You?	labels:I’m “pear-shaped” too, but tall with long legs. I fell like the stuff that gets recommended for pear shapes is garbage. Wrap dresses and a-line dresses are 2 things I see recommended all the time and I’ve never found one to be flattering.  I’ve found fits just from trial and error, and when I find one that I think works and is comfy, that’s basically my uniform.
text:So I’m pear shaped with long legs too. Could never understand why wrap dresses never worked for me and blamed my small breasts. I’ve recently learned that it’s in fact my short torso that is the cause as the wrap part comes down to just above my hips rather then accenting my waist. If i tied it around my waist, then the fabric around my breasts would flap open forward. Maybe this is the same for you. But I agree - trial and error & stick to what works for you!	labels:This is my exact problem with wrap-dresses! I am an hourglass, for which this style is recommended even more frequently, and it's always a battle to keep my breasts inside the bodice part. It's 100% a short torso issue and it drives me crazy, cause all it would take is an inch or so of shortening from the shoulder line to work! Oh, why don't we all have tailors...	episode_done:True
text:Hiking Aesthetic - Functionality vs. Fashion	labels:I agree with another commenter that you should test what you have and go from there (but don't wear any shoes you don't want to risk destroying, obvs). For casual hiking and cycling I wear leggings or denim shorts with a breathable natural-fiber top and rugged boots or tennis shoes, and maybe a leather belt. With hiking in particular you might look at interesting hats if you wanna stand out on the trail, I like to wear my Stetson [Kelso](https://stetson.com/products/kelso-outdoor-hat-driftwood) hat on long hikes when it's not too hot.   Of course, if what you're looking for is a "hiking aesthetic" then you're probably best off cruising around the REI website for those brands. If that's what you're looking for visually that's cool but for the most part you don't need to always look the part to be a capital-H Hiker. The deeper you get into the sport aspect of it though, the more specialized gear you'll likely find that you need. At that point I typically stop giving AF about what I look like because I'm like... really sweaty and disgusting anyway lol.	episode_done:True
text:What are you hoping to buy on Black Friday?	labels:I haven’t planned yet but I’m glad of a few weeks to prep.  Most importantly, I need new running and hiking shoes (different ones) and would love to nab them on sale.  I’d also love to grab new socks and tights and replace some worn out pairs in my drawer, and maybe score one great underwire bra to complement my bralettes. Optionally, id also love a new swimsuit, but it’s very easy to pick the wrong size online.   In sartorial matters, I have been doing luxury minimalism for a long time and would love to score some loud accessories - a new everyday handbag in warm brown/ taupe tones (I have several in black but none in brown), some statement jewelry or scarves. I am also in the market for really adventurous, ethereal pieces, like big dresses, loud coats, colorful blouses, and structured pants.	episode_done:True

text:Recent Purchases - December 09, 2020	labels:[Studio D’Artisan GZ-011 Limited Edition Selvedge Jacket](https://imgur.com/gallery/Uyt9szi)  Received about a week ago as a birthday gift.  This is my first selvedge jacket and I absolutely love it so far.  I have a 3Sixteen Indigo Nep Ranch Jacket that is great but nothing compared to the nep and heft of this 18oz raw denim from Studio D’Artisan.  The Godzilla detailing is subtle which I like. Adds some character to the piece without being super noticeable. The color stitching around the button holes is a nice touch as well.  Sorry about the lack of fit picks, couldn’t get one with decent lighting inside by myself. Longer in the torso than a traditional Type 2 but still nice and boxy. I was between sizes but sized up because I wanted a boxy fit, so I have to cuff the sleeves. I don’t mind too much because the inside cuff shows off some of the chain stitching.	episode_done:True

I'd prefer to avoid Oxford style also (just a personal preference)   2. Im having trouble maintaining my workout routine cause its so fucking cold of a morning, any decent recommendations for longer workout gear ?
text:What’s mid range in dollars?	labels:I'm okay with like 50-100 for a flannel that will last me a few years at least.	episode_done:True
text:How much was your most expensive fashion item and when or how often do you wear it?	labels:Not counting formalwear, definitely coats. I pretty much live in wool overcoats from October to April. I've thrifted quite a few and bought others on sale, but I find things originally priced in the $250-$450 range are usually a decent bet. Last year I stumbled into a fantastic Aritzia sale and picked up a black-and-white houndstooth coat and a bright orange wrap coat for under $200 each—it was a splurge-y day, but I'll wear them both for many years. I'm hoping to find options in another bright colour (maybe apple green, sky blue or light purple) and dark red this year.  I would also pay this much for leather outerwear, trousers, bags or boots—but these are not things I purchase often. I am vaguely considering some black or burgundy leather straight-leg trousers this season, but with COVID I'm not sure sure there are enough opportunities to wear them.
text:I've got a hand-made tweed hacking jacket that bought in Edinburgh and refuse to translate the price on, and my winter coat is a Filson Seattle Cruiser that was in the $450 range. Each will last me a lifetime. I have to watch myself around coats: they're so practical, yet you can have so many fine gradations of need /situation, that I own way too many	labels:I inherited my dad's Filson jacket when he passed.

text:What socks do you guys wear? and some advice on socks please?	labels:I invest in good socks. I’ve realized a long time ago that I get easily cold once my feet becomes cold. So during the winter months, I wear Goodyear welted shoes with 100% merino wool or merino blend socks. So here are some brand I like.   Uniqlo  I really like the thick airism socks they have each year. I bought this by accident too. They had them on clearance towards the end of winter for $1.90 so I bought 3 pairs and I was instantly hooked. The following year they made them again so I bought more and this time they had a mid length ones. So far those are the only ones that come out each year.   Costco  They used to have the merino blend socks. But this year I guess times are tough - they are no where in the store and are replaced by 100% polyester ones. The issue I had with the merino ones were they were so thin and can get ratty after sometime. It’s cheap.  Woolrich  These are ok. First time I wore them earlier this year when we first locked down and I saw a bunch of them for $2 a pair. I couldn’t let it go plus 40% off extra. Not a whole lot of merino in them and they are thin. They did have a few camp socks versions but they are pretty big in my feet.   Alaska Knits  These are probably the most comfy and best fitting ones I have. I get them at target when it’s on clearance. I have small feet so the women’s version fits me. Can’t complain when it’s less then $3 a pair.  Vintage  Believe it or not there’s a lot of socks unused at thrift stores. I buy the wool ones end they are absolutely perfect for winter. It’s rare to find these at dirt cheap prices. I get them between $1-$3.	episode_done:True

I actually met a guy dressed as Lance at a party and told him we were each one ball off from the real deal. He didn't find that as funny as I did.  Slutty Abe Lincoln.

text:Brooks Brothers's Future Looks a Lot Like Menswear’s Past	labels:* Less SKUs. The amount of stuff BB sells is overwhelming.  * Do away with there weirdly named fit system. Change it to Extra Slim, Slim, Regular, Thicc Daddies * Revamp the BB website. It's been terrible for a long time. * Have the athleisure stuff, but also focus on high quality basics, again with less SKUs. Have something like an "essentials" line. The Navy Suit. The Charcoal Suit. The OCDB. The Chino. The Wool Trouser. Without fifty million variations thereof. You go now and it's like here are three navy suits with different kinds of stretch, here are four more with some kind of temperature controlling fabric. Just give me a half to full canvas lined 100% wool navy suit in various fits and sizes. In other words, simplify your menswear line to cut down on SKUs, and that will give you more room to play with sheep on skis and stuff (i think that does sound kind of cute, very Ralph Lauren). * Do away with Golden Fleece, Red Fleece. Mainline only. Again confusing to the consumer. * Where BB could play more is in areas like sport shirts. By all means offer your classics like blackwatch etc., but other menswear shops like Sid Mashburn or Todd Snyder offer all kinds of fun prints and colors while still feeling like classic #menswear.  i dunno, just riffing my own personal desires for BB. i don't know anything about running a large clothing manufacturer and retailer.
text:Golden Fleece is their high quality shit, I wouldn't get rid of it -- maybe combine it with black fleece. Black fleece is more experimental, though, not sure.  Red fleece is their diffusion line, probably a moneymaker. Probably not worth getting rid of.  What they should really do is minimize everything in between -- 1818, mainline, peal and co (a footwear line), etc. -- and then standardize fits. Right now people see one item marked "red fleece" and another marked "regent" and they have no diea what the difference is -- because one is a line and the other is a fit. That's insane.  It's also really hard to track their sales... Even their 1818/Mainline (wait, is 1818 the mainline or are these two different things?) suits vary wildly in quality. Honestly, it might not be wrong to add a separate label for their premium suits, but it couldn't just be for suits, they would need to have distinct tiers across all of their products, and they usually don't make high-end casualwear as is.	labels:Peal & Co was just 3rd party makers doing footwear.

text:Do you feel constrained fashion-wise by not wanting to (or being able to) wear heels?	labels:This is an interesting take for me, as I feel constrained by my circumstances to not wear heels but in a different manner. I am 6'1" at 20 years old, and I always feel self conscious wearing heels as I tower over some men and women. It elicits unwanted comments of "wow, you are so tall!! I would never want to be that height" and it makes me insecure sometimes.  This is especially true in male-dominated spaces. I generally feel as though my height requires me to make (some) men feel at ease so they are not overly intimidated by me and instead will take me and my ideas seriously. Therefore, adding heels to my already tall frame exacerbates the problem.  I'm trying to work through these feelings of perception and insecurity because I absolutely love styling heels!
text:I'm only 5 11 and I \*still\* get this shit from men. It's hard to work through, but I will say that while at 33 I give a lot less fucks about what random dudes think, it's so annoying when I get it from women. When I got married several women I know asked if I would wear heels to the wedding because 'your husband won't want you to be taller than him, will he?" Uhhh I'm taller than him already so...?	labels:I’m 5’10’’ and in the same boat. I don’t currently wear super high heels (just a 1 inch or so on boots). I’m still taller than most of the men I work with and don’t care!  But I’m also that person who just decided to wear sneakers/boots with basically everything.

Shirt or tent dresses? You can wear belts with them to help accentuate the waist when you want to.  I hear you...I have 15 pairs of jeans minimum in varying sizes to account for my weekly flux and of course in each cut. :( Which is why I love leggings and shirt/tent dresses so much.	episode_done:True

text:Is fast fashion really fast fashion if you get years of use out of the garments?	labels:I recently Marie Kondo’d my closet and was shocked at how many items I have kept from high school (9 years ago) and college (5 years ago). I have some more expensive, sustainable items I’ve added in the last couple years but the majority of my closet still includes “fast fashion” basics that have lasted quite a while and I won’t be tossing anytime soon. Curious to hear more discussion here - from an environmental standpoint, I’d think it would be better to buy less overall regardless of manufacturer, and when you do *need* to buy something, seek out more sustainable or ethical brands or thrift?
text:i still have clothes from high school (20 years ago lol)	labels:I regularly wear a high school sweatshirt that’s 30 years old.	episode_done:True
text:What is your "White Whale" fashion product that apparently doesn't exist?	labels:I don't know if this counts, but actual summer weight clothing.  I don't particularly like slathering sunscreen over myself and hate tan lines.  Finding breathable linen or cotton cardis/pants/etc that are both light weight enough to wear in Maryland summer heat/humidity and covering is so hard :(  I have a small set I've collected, but nothing nearly as stylish as I'd like.  Oh and a real wool deep purple winter coat that's super fitted double breasted affair with a fur rimmed hood and doesn't cause me immense back pain from the arms not fitting quite right.  My girlfriend has a red one that's just perfect, but I can't find anything like in my color.
text:Last year Target had this line of pants/shorts that were a linen rayon blend, and I swear I bought one of every color they had. I wore them almost every day this summer. And because of the rayon, the pants didn't have that typical wrinkly look of linen	labels:	episode_done:True

text:[Inspo Album & Commentary] In Recursion: Japanese Traditionalist Futurism & Futurist Traditionalism	labels:We need a content warning for bondage now? :p  But really: excellent album--even if I was expecting a bit more bondagey stuff. Glad to see Julius in here. It occurs to me that this is precisely what I've been interested in for a while, without really recognizing it. I don't go as much for Acronym, or the more overtly "tech" stylings, but they sometimes overlap with what this album presents, and I had a hard time distinguishing them. So this is really helpful, in terms of identifying specific brands.
text:Honestly, I just like to include content warnings for any kind of unexpected content -- most people click on MFA inspo albums expecting like thirty pictures of pants and not, uh, artistic kinbaku and human plastination!	labels:Just kidding :) Content warnings are always good and a nice gesture of consideration for the diversity of possible audiences. I routinely include them when teaching, etc.	episode_done:True
text:Somebody else loosing so much time to choose the right item to buy when looking for something?

Now it's November, we are on lockdown again, I found one I like although pricey, and by the time I can go out again it will be too cold to wear it. So I can't justify the buy now. I suppose that if we want a curated wardrobe of quality, it is a process we have to go through.  But yeah, doesn't mean we can't complain about it, I share your frustration 😫

Teach fashion to your kids if you feel like it, but don't be surprised if your daughter tells you to fuck off with your eyebrow plucking nonsense or spends her teenage years giggling about your style with her friends or doing the exact opposite of whatever hair advice you give her. Kids are ruthless.	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 08, 2020	labels:This is a stupid question about red thread on suit cuff buttons.  I Just got a suit from suitsupply. It had red thread on the lapel buttonhole, vents, shoulders and cuffs. Snipped off easily. But there are four cuff buttons on each sleeve, and only the button closest to the hand is sewn on with red thread. I don't get it. What am I supposed to do about this? Have a tailor resew them on with dark thread? Is this the style? It's a navy suit, so the red stands out. Any advice appreciated. Thanks
text:I doubt it’ll really stand out to anyone else but if you don’t like it you can buy a basic sewing kit from 7-11 for like 8 bucks and redo it yourself I normally resew buttons on everything at some point or another, quite literally the easiest mend you can learn	labels:	episode_done:True

text:(UPDATE) Ladies who miss fashion/makeup/getting dressed up... how are you doing?	labels:I don't have any occasions to dress up, but I **make** occasions to dress up. Nowadays I go all out for the grocery store. I'm the weirdo stomping around the frozen section in tabi boots. It's been awesome to "test drive" outfits I wouldn't feel comfortable enough to wear to work or out with friends. I'm sure the checkout lady has seen crazier.    Also, it's been a good reason to buy everything local instead of online -- I can reach most things with a short walk/bike, and I just really love having reasons to leave the apartment right now.    I do miss lipstick though!	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 12, 2021	labels:What is an alternative to sweatshirts and pullovers (especially during winter)? They don't seem to suit me as I have quite a big butt (even though I'm slim). It causes any pullover to ride up and not sit nicely.  Perhaps a shirt with thermals underneath? Cardigans? I'm not sure. It's a shame because I enjoy the casual, minimalistic look of a decent sweatshirt. Many thanks.
text:I mean, it also sounds like you should look for sweatshirts that have a boxier fit (shorter in length).	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How to build a style with a limited outlet?	labels:Where are you from? Are you a student or a working adult? What is your budget and purpose of dressing up? Do you have any spare weekend to go into a megastore (e.g. Zara, your local department store...) to try out all types of colors and silhouettes to see what suits you? You're not obligated to buy even if you try it on. If anyone ask, just say you're just trying out and still thinking about it.             I suggest knowing your measurements (use a measuring tape!) and sticking to a capsule wardrobe. Black/White top + colorful bottom or colorful top + black/white/brown bottom with neutral shoes.       Keep in mind the stylish people on social media spend a ton on their clothes or rent/return them after taking photos so they are not exactly appropriate comparisons for everyone.	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 07, 2021	labels:Hey guys, brand new to this forum so go easy. Where do you guys find quality fabrics? I'm not really impressed by flashy brands usually, but when I was a teen I got a pair of hand me down Gucci denim shorts, these to be specific([https://www.ebay.com/itm/Vintage-Bootleg-Gucci-Jean-Shorts-/164302034765](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Vintage-Bootleg-Gucci-Jean-Shorts-/164302034765)). I have never been more impressed with an article of clothing in my life, the craftsmanship and the quality were amaaazing. I swore as soon as I got real money I would be a Gucci fanboy for life. Well, now I'm a relatively successful working professional and while I still have that positive experience with the Gucci brand in my head, most of their current fashion trends are wayyyyy too eccentric for me. I've set aside money in the past to build a baseline wardrobe , preferably in the $1k range altogether although I would pay more if I fell in love. I live next to A huge outlet mall for all the name brands, but all the ones I've browsed through just seem like cheap fabric with an fancy logo and an expensive price tag. Any recommendations would be appreciated.
text:Do you have a particular affinity for designer brands in general? I will say that sometimes at outlet malls the products will be inferior in quality compared to what you'd find at a mainline store. There is also a lot more diffusion brand stuff at outlets with lower quality. For example I'd always see a bunch of Z Zegna stuff at the outlet when most people are looking for Ermenegildo Zegna.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:The Pajama Spectrum	labels:sleep shorts or leggings, as soft a fabric as I can find, and loose, scoop neck t-shirts.  My sister in law made me some straight leg flannel sleep pants in cute prints last Christmas, which were perfect for keeping me warm all winter.

text:Better With Age: 10 Things Better Bought Used – Put This On	labels:To add to this article, vintage made in the usa rugby shirts and vintage Columbia are extremely cheap and well made. Vintage Patagonia is disgustingly expensive, but I have found that Columbia in the 80s and 90s is far superior in quality and holds up nicely. On ebay you can pick up vintage Columbia for a fraction of what Patagonia is selling for.  Edit: thinking of this after the fact, vintage full grain leather belts are in abundance at thrift stores and the quality far exceeds current leather belts being produced.

text:Speaking to the LGBTQ-owned label whose kilts were adopted by Proud Boys	labels:I understand discontinuing the kilts to disassociate with them, but why not just keep selling them and continue to give all profits to charity?

text:Just how revolutionary is Harry Styles’ Vogue cover?	labels:The article hit all the points I was thinking except one. Why Harry? Why do we all look at Harry Styles when talking about revolutionary men's fashion when there are so many others who've done it before and are doing it right now. Just a thought.
text:My theory on why Harry is this: playing with gender in fashion isn't new as you pointed out, eternal icons like Grace Jones have been there and done that. However, Harry's instance is unique because we have seen in a highly publicized way the evolution of how he sees his gender. He started as a (sorry fans) generic white musician with bland style and has since sort of aggressively redone his look. I'm sure he's been called "brave" in numerous articles documenting his steps towards this moment. Similar pretty boys like Ansel Elgort and even people like Post Malone have played with gender, but none in an as aggressively pursued and marketed way as Harry did. I also think people see that he has an X-factor because of his sexual identity. Billy Porter being a publicly queer person is sort of expected to do these things. Yeah his gown moment was highly publicized but it certainly didn't "break the internet" and spawn discussion like this did.  edit: also exactly what u/Anthraxistaken said	labels:I was thinking that too about how it was all because we've seen his growth and I couldn't have summed it up better.	episode_done:True

Will you be posting this daily on Instagram, or a final post? I would love to see the final product!
text:As far as vintage influence with subversive twists, I'm also figuring out what that means! However, it seems to be the common denominator in a few of my favorite combos: vintage dress + combat boots, classic blazers + ripped jeans + wedge sneakers, menswear inspired trousers + crop tops. Part of this endeavor is figuring out how to translate that aesthetic into something more grown up (I'm 31 and recently made a career switch).   I can tell you the list off the top of my head, at least the ones that didn't immediately get cut once I started researching, because I've been going over it so much! I also included notes on what I like about them. I can at least post the ones people are interested in.   Darlene Conner (Roseanne) - flannel, oversized tops, dark colors   Faith (buffy) - Buffy gets credit for the red leather pants, but we all know that's faith's influence   Buffy (Buffy) - feminine details, leather   Cordelia Chase (Buffy) - monochromatic mixes of luxe fabrics   Willow Rosenthal (Buffy) - boho influence, pattern mixing   Donna Pinciotti (That 70s Show) - bell bottoms, flannel  Jackie Burkhart (That 70s Show) - peasant tops, styling (we're similar coloring), bell bottoms    Bette Porter (The L Word) - power suit   Alice Pieszecki (The L Word) - exaggerated feminine details, jumpsuits   Shane McCutchen (The L Word) - androgynous styling, blazers   Tina Kennard (The L Word) - this one is more of a joke. She spends a whole season in these awful knit ponchos, and I happen to have a bunch of ponchos from when my family sold them in our gift shop  Jenny Schechter (The L Word) - vintage pieces, neutral colors, eyeliner on point. I also happen to have an almost exact replica of her wedding dress.   Jenny Humphrey (Gossip Girl) - "dark" Jenny with dark colors, layered sweaters, and knee socks   Blair Waldorf (Gossip Girl) - pattern mixing, lace tights  Serena Van Der Woodson (Gossip Girl) - street style, boho influence  Aria Montgomery (Pretty Little Liars) - jewel tones, fringe, statement earrings   Spencer Hastings (PLL) - the boot collection!

text:General Discussion - November 17, 2020	labels:Hot take time:  "It's a clash in formality" is a baseless and invalid criticism, and if we're going to ask lurkers/new people to do better than "it's just bad" then we should ask the same of our community  I saw very few criticisms of sneaker/dress shoe hybrids in the other thread that amounted to much more than just "they're different formalities so they're bad" but I've seen ties in casual outfits, jeans worn with tailoring, and suits worn with tank tops come off fantastic. Shit if we're gonna give Thom Browne credit for the short suit that's a massive formality clash.  Not saying that there aren't reasons to critiques sneaker/dress shoe hybrids but if you're gonna say that individual shoes are somehow objectively bad and *especially* if you're gonna say that an entire category (subgenre?) of shoes is irredeemable then I expect a better reason than "formality clashes are bad"  Also separate but related hot take:  Caring about the rules of formality is at worst barely-coated elitism and at best it's nerd shit and should be ignored

According to the website, most people say it fits true to size and the model in the photo is 6'1" and wearing a M. I usually get stuff in a medium but the sleeves are 35.5".

I honestly have no idea where 2021 will see me, what I will be doing, or what I will need to wear to do it.   I would, however, like to update some of my casual stuff, as I have had some very well meaning folks in my life gently let me know that my casual wear does look like I wore it in highschool (and they're right - I'm currently wearing a graphic tee I bought in 7th grade, and at home I tend to wear the jeans I bought as my "back to school" pants for freshman. I'm almost 30.   For the past 10 years I really only focused on updating/growing my "career" clothes (dress for the job you want and all...), so on days off I have been wearing stuff that's either 10 years old, or hand me downs from female relatives. This year I'd like to try and consciously update that part of my wardrobe. Perhaps a new pair of boot cut and skinny jeans that fit well, or that I take to get tailored, and a few versatile shirts that aren't "office attire" but also aren't tee shirts.   And then I'm always trying to justify needing "brand name" designer heels to myself, and now that I don't see myself commuting by bus at all in the near future, I might consider it if I find work again in my previous field.	episode_done:True

text:How do you dress for the (extreme) weather where you're from?	labels:Midwest (southeast Ohio) summer (tends to be mid 80s- low 90s with hella humidity) I pretty much live in maxi and knee length dresses with anti chaff shorts underneath- plus sized girl here (18W). I found brands for both the dresses and shorts on amazon- all dresses have pockets because the one thing I dislike about summer is no jacket pockets! Winters have been fairly mild the last few years but pretty much live in booties/boots, wool socks, leggings and tunics or the knee length summer dresses with a chunky sweater over them. If I go for jeans I usually wear a tshirt with chunky sweater or hoodie and I have a pair of bzees boots that look kind of space whey with a wedge heel that are Uber comfy. I have super broad shoulders which are hard to fit for coats without feeling super constricted so I found a north face wind resistant fleece a few years ago I wear under a full zip asymmetrical hoodie with scarf, hat and gloves.

text:Revisiting Tim Gunn's List of 10 Style Must-haves	labels:To me, this is “wardrobe staples if you have a traditional office job with a business dress code” tbh. I do, so I own a version of most of these, but that kind of work environment is less and less common, and I think a lot of women no longer have much use for blazers, trench coats, dress pants, etc.
text:I feel like this list can be modernized by stating an item's function, rather than defining what the items themselves should be.   For instance, instead of the blazer and dress pants, the description "an outfit well-suited for a professional job interview" would work well, and then one could discuss various pieces that could work within these constraints, such as a well-fitting cardigan and a pencil skirt.   Instead of a "little black dress," what they really mean is "an easy and versatile somewhat-formal piece" that's suitable for anything from a work happy hour to a holiday party and is easy to dress up or down. Doesn't have to be a dress, doesn't have to be black, but something that has the same level of versatility and formality that's appropriate for multiple occasions.   Instead of "classic white shirt," could mean a "versatile neutral top" that can be coordinated multiple ways across multiple contexts, worn casually on its own or as a foundation piece under a pantsuit. "Trench coat" is similar--a piece of outerwear that has trend longevity and can be worn atop most outfits, but obviously this changes depending on your climate; a down coat could fill this wardrobe niche if you're somewhere cold.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:How has the quality changed over the years at some of your fav brands?	labels:Madewell - I ordered a plain black t shirt during covid just for lounging and the thing literally had a hole already in the front when it arrived.  Aritzia - I've been shopping there for well over a decade and while you really can't compare fabric from so long ago (it's incomparable imo) even just the stitching is becoming obviously bad. Last winter I saw a blazer, still on the rack in store, with threads already sticking out at the shoulder seam. Absolutely ridiculous. However, I will say their peacoats have turned around a bit - not what they used to be but a couple years ago they looked like they were made out of felt and definitely have gotten better since then.  American Eagle - I really like the new curvy fit of their jeans, 10/10, and I feel like the aerie underwear quality has gotten better, the last couple of years the material had gone downhill.
text:I have a few Babaton by aritzia  dresses made of seriously 100ply silk. They’re all secondhand and I don’t know what year they’re from but dolman minis were in.

text:Your thoughts on leopard print (and animal prints in general)	labels:I am just a bit older than you and watched Narcos last year and it was an immediate throwback to the animal silks of the late 80s early 90s. My husband recently took one look at a silk shirt I was considering with a leopard print and said, “you look like a Columbian drug lord’s girlfriend” and it made me laugh a bit.  I don’t mind it actually - especially the recent prints are much more refined and subtle than they used to be. My main issue with them is the styles they currently come in - silk shirt, midi skirt or cami slip dress. The [midi skirt](https://www.papermag.com/leopard-print-midi-skirts-defense-2637908605.html) look is not one I can pull off with my body shape, regardless of print. It just instantly makes my legs look shorter and body wider and unflattering.  I honestly almost bought this [silk zebra print slip dress](https://www.nordstrom.com/s/cami-nyc-raven-zebra-silk-slipdress/5509589) but realized that the weather for which it’s appropriate to style with a jean or bomber jacket (cool but not cold) really only happens for like a week or two here in the fall. Seems out of place for spring for some reason and summer is just too hot to wear it with a jacket, and without a jacket, it just looks odd on me like both dressy (length and fabric and print) and yet undressed at the same time  By the way if anyone is looking for animal prints, one of my [fav boutiques](https://c2.clothing/collections/crazy-sale?_usf_take=176) is having a huge sale with a lot of animal print items from like NYC Cami, Frame, L’Agence etc on like 70-90% off	episode_done:True

text:what pieces/brands did you buy when moving from a warmer climate to a cooler climate? what did you end up regretting/not using?	labels:I didn't move to a north climate but I was born and raised here! I also am lucky to travel a lot for work.  It depends on the exact climate but for almost all of them the secret is quality base layers. Things like thin thermals and quality socks will allow you to wear your favorite jeans and shoes without freezing your butt off and a thermal shirt can go under other long sleeve tees, button ups, jackets, and sweaters.  Here in the PNW it's all about the jackets baybe. Jackets in the office, at home, at the club. A jacket lets you keep the cold out by zipping or buttoning up outside and then unzipping once inside while keeping the jacket on. Underneath you can have a blouse, tee, or thermal. Compare this to the Midwest, which usually goes for a sweaters and coats pair up because it's much colder. Wool sweaters are warmer but they're also more cumbersome to change out of if you're too hot inside.  Shoes are given a lot more leeway when you're north. I was part of our company's hiring process and while appropriate dress was discussed, the only requirement for shoes was that they be a certain color and often close toed. You'll get compliments for cute shoes, but nobody will notice or judge if you wear the same pair of boots 300 days of the year. Most people go for only short and chunky heels, or no heels due to slippery ice, mud and slush.  Outer coats are usually something that is heavily dependent on what northern area you're going to also. While PNW people tent to have a couple different jackets (rain coat, windbreaker, leather, and outer wool "winter" coat) if you're somewhere it gets mega freezing you're more likely to see people that have "The coat" an expensive piece, usually a puffer, that is built for utility rather than fashion, and goes *over* the outfit you actually want to show people. Alaska is the king of this ofc. Go to any bar in fairbanks mid febuary and you'll see a bunch of thermals and coats, fashion be damned because it's -30 fahrenheit.  ETA: where north are you moving? It can really help narrow down useful items to know.
text:Do you mean Jackets as in blazers? I'd love to see what your all day jacket is in PNW.	labels:Actually from what I see blazers (and all suit pieces) are fairly rare in the PNW. Fashion seems to be a scale of fully casual to at most business casual, and a *lot* of workplaces allow jeans+tee shirts. If you see someone in a suit or blazer you can fairly often predict they're in finance. Just about everyone perpetually looks like they're ready for a day hike in the foothills (even if they've never hiked a day in their life).  [Field jackets are huge up here.](https://www.jcrew.com/nl/p/womens_category/coats_and_jackets/utilityjacket/quilted-downtown-field-jacket/G7608) I'd say literally every one of my friends (25-30ish) owns at least one. You'll often see them layered with a hoodie underneath.  At one point [North face](https://www.thenorthface.com/shop/womens-jackets-vests-fleece/womens-denali-2-jacket-nf0a4r2u?variationId=JK3) had a vice grip on the jacket game up here and you'll still see the echoes of that happening now, even though there's more diversity. [Athletic jackets](https://global.llbean.com/shop/Womens-Airlight-Knit-Full-Zip-Hoodie/122977.html) in general are fairly common, probably because they're again good for layering in our perpetually 40-65 degree weather.  If it ever *does* get cold you get a mix of some people just wearing all their jackets on top of each other, people with hoodies or sweatshirts underneath of rain coats, or a [midsized wool coat](https://www.nordstromrack.com/s/laundry-by-shelli-segal-faux-fur-trim-hooded-coat/n3328082?color=FROST%20GREY&eid=431547). I've noticed puffers are far less prevalent here than some other northern cities, probably because they don't often hold up well in rain (which we obviously get a lot of), dont layer well, and dont store well in a bag if you get too hot.  ETA: for a mental image of the level of casual we're talking here, the CEO of my company is most often seen in a cashmere sweater layered over a buttoned up shirt, no tie, and a nice pair of jeans and brogues.	episode_done:True
text:Help with 2020 post-COVID scrubs style	labels:I hated myself for buying a pair of figs butttttttt they really are fantastic. Before that I was 100% all hospital given scrubs all the time but with the figs you can still get professional looking (I’m a resident and I feel like the cartoon scrubs are not so much our forte) and they’re sooo comfortable.   I wear an Apple Watch with a silicon strap and my engagement/wedding ring if I’m on regular wards on a rubber ring if I need to be scrubbing. As for shoes, I bought some Skechers memory foam shoes and put in my own arch support (but sometimes when I’m feeling FASHION I wear the jogger bottom figs with my high top vans)  I generally put on a department Patagonia for my jacket (because do they even know you’re a doctor without a Patagonia? Lmao). And finally, and laziest, I cut my hair into a bob and got a loose spiral perm so my hair is wavy. I realized when it was longer all I was doing was putting into a bun anyways so honestly this is easier. Someday when I’m a grown up I’ll grow it out again
text:I totally feel you on the long/short hair thing. Part of me loves my long hair, its like a mane, but I feel like I'm just not old enough to take care of it and make it look nice lol. I just recently tried growing it out again over Quarantine and I can't stand it most of the time! It's always up in a bun or some excuse for a bun anyway. Getting it chopped to my shoulders again pretty soon and I can't WAIT to feel like I've got my hair together again. Your perm is gorgeous by the way!!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do I improve my fashion sense beyond just tshirt and jeans?	labels:I am with a lot of the people here saying don’t rush out to buy items you think you should own - take the time to consider what you love about your current look/body shape and push forward in that direction. Some great advice can be found on youtube as well - Jenny Mustard, Justine Leconte and Dearly Bethany are some accounts whose style-related videos I think are super helpful for this. They tend to focus on knowing yourself and honing in on what you want and will make you feel confident rather than trying to follow someone else’s recipe.	episode_done:True

text:How would you describe the quality of self-knit/self-made clothes vs. store bought?	labels:In my experience as a knitter for over 10 years, my handmade knits last longer than store bought clothes. With the exception of socks, which I refuse to ever knit again. Those get holes in them so fast that I literally cried because I spent hundreds of hours making them and used fancy ass yarn. Store bought socks for me only.  ETA:  I took some quick pics of my sock situation: Top pic is a handknit sock that started to get a hole, you can see my finger through the stitches. The matching sock had a huge hole at the heel and has already been unravelled to use on something else. Second pic is a comparison between Smartwool on top and my handknit sock using Wollmeise on the bottom. My stitches look huge in comparison to the store bought ones 😢 [https://imgur.com/a/WEHMRav](https://imgur.com/a/WEHMRav)
text:bummer :(  That's happened to me a few times too.  Did the yarn have nylon?  That will help give it strength.  I love knitting socks but it's heartbreaking when you get a hole.  I have 2 pairs with holes that I need to try to repair sometime.	labels:Yes, they were good quality sock yarns :( Kroy and Casbah were two of the ones I've tried. I also bought the smallest size needles (000 I think) because I read that the tinier stitches form a stronger fabric. Nope. Still wore out at the back of the heel. I understand why knitters are obsessed with clogs/Danskos now.	episode_done:True

Others are dress shoes or loafers for warmer weather. Basically looking for something for a date in a casual-mid-level restaurant/bar that we will likely be outside under heat lamps for the next few month  What is everyone wearing for this sort of thing? Do I just do the clean white sneaker/trainer aesthetic but in black? A more casual style black Chelsea? Any other suggestions?  Me: Late 30s, but admittedly probably dress on the younger end for my age Budget: under $200, though less is better Location: Philadelphia (tends to be more casual than NYC, where I used to live)
text:Does it have to be black? I'd probably wear docs myself.	labels:Doesn't have to be black per se, but generally I think of my outfits and then have an idea if it would call for black or brown shoes. I feel like I currently like my Brown winter options but have a bit of a hole for black options. Maybe something like navy or gray could also work, but I'm just not visualizing right now, so here asking.	episode_done:True

Lol.	labels:I just don’t feel dresses in leggings and T-shirt. That’s what I wear under stuff, or to exersise, or as pjs. If 8m actually trying to get stuff done then I am dressing properly. Might be canvas work pants, work shirt over a linen top, and boots with a hat, or it might be a random satin blouse and wool skirt to go to class.	episode_done:True

If he won't wear them then yea some joggers or track pants would have to do.

text:How many handbags do you have and which one is your most used?	labels:I've got a ton (not sure the exact # but it's about 20) but I change up my accessories fairly often.  I rotate my handbags out in seasonally; earlier this season, it was my brown fringe, green, and black grommet crossbodies, but I swapped to a blue straw pouch I use as an insert, and 3 totes recently, because I found myself wearing a previously untouched [tote](https://www.depop.com/products/underthejrose-afi-crash-love-tote-bag/) I'd had 10+ years daily, and I bought [two](https://www.amazon.com/IKEA-POTTFRILLA-Multicolor-grocery-904-847-67/dp/B0859RXW31) [new](https://www.ikea.com/es/en/p/hostpromenad-bag-grey-90482853/) ones for variety.  Usually I don't buy bags for years, since I know what functionality I want and and will have a couple variations, so it takes ages to wear them out.  I also don't tend to be too fussed about the quality, once it looks sturdy enough. I doubt I could ever be about luxury handbags; where I live tends to be aggressively casual (which I tend to do with accessories since my style is dressier) and I'd be worried it'd make me a target.	episode_done:True

I say this as someone who collects and routinely searches for Japanese clothes that are released in limited runs and the secondhand market for which is very cutthroat. They routinely sell far above original retail. The dress I’m searching for at the moment doesn’t get much talk and a lot of people aren’t super aware of it’s existence so I want to keep it that way

I’ll mainly be wearing it casually so I think I’ll mainly be going untucked. How do I find an OCBD that actually fits me? I’m 5’8” and around 165, slightly athletic build.  Edit: I think I got the neck and sleeves right, but the shirt length specifically which doesn’t appear to be a common measurement when buying shirts
text:The neck is a bit tight but fine if you're not going to wear a tie, the sleeve length is also a bit short but fine if it's going to be worn casually without a suit. It's long because it's meant to be tucked in. You can get it shortened at a tailor. Otherwise try other brands like JCrew untucked fit which is a slightly short or Asket.	labels:Gotcha, it doesn't seem like that was something that is specified with OCBDs (the length or whether it should be tucked/untucked) or maybe I didn't look hard enough? And interesting about the sleeves, I actually they might be a bit long if anything because of how they ruffle up at the elbow.	episode_done:True

I usually wake up, put on a sweatshirt, some sweatpants or jeans and that's it for the day at school. Most the time that happens cause it's so early when I wake up. Basically I'm dreadful at style and look stupid most the time. I kinda wanna branch out and look better and my goal by June is to kinda be an improved better version of myself etc. I just don't want anything to fancy or crazy cause I live in a kinda conservative area and some fits would be seen as "weird" or "gay" (which is fuckin stupid). So yeah that's basically it it's really hard to have any sort of style but I hope it's something I get better at. Anyone got recommendations?
text:To be completely honest with you, I went through the same phase (I'm 19 now). What ended up working out for me the most is simply youtube, fashion YouTubers are a great way to start off your style. They emphasize fit, and once you get into high-end fashion, you realize that you dont have to follow a lot of these style "rules," as you will see with the oversized fits. HOWEVER, I highly recommend if you are fit, that you wear fitted (not tight and uncomfortable), but fitted throughout your arms and body. That's what got me the most compliments when I started off learning about style, I could legitimately be wearing the most basic outfit, like jeans and a nice sweater, but when they fit perfectly you tend to look thinner, more muscular, and generally more attractive.   My second tip for style, if you live somewhere that isn't hot year-round is layering. Although a nice fitting sweater/sweatshirt and jeans will look great, again it's basic. That's where I got stuck for a while starting my style journey, I became too basic where I wasn't experimenting. People thought I was dressed very well, but it's always the same, bland, the fit no longer saves you. When you add a puffer vest, flannel, jacket, etc, it adds dimension to your fits, especially if they fit well too.   Finally, I recommend jewelry. Dont overdo it and become those kids who wear 15 bracelets on one hand, think minimal. One or two bracelets on a hand, a watch on the other, a ring or two, and a necklace. Now you dont have to wear all of these at once but I recommend getting to wear at least one or two of them, I guarantee people will ask about it and compliment it. Now, this doesn't have to be expensive stuff here, I've actually bought stuff from amazon before and it works very well. A ring on amazon is like $5-10, a bracelet is around the same cost, you see where im going here.   DONT try and copy other people's style, the biggest mistake you will make when is building this new wardrobe to dress better is watching specific outfits, people, where and buy pieces like that DONT. Instead pick a style that you like, not an outfit. If you like flannels, buy one or two of them, then look at different ways you can wear the flannel, and buy pieces that will compliment that. Always try to pick versatile pieces, you are in high school, so I dont know how much you can afford to buy all these different pieces of clothing, so start with basics and see different ways you can wear these basics. If you have any questions hmu, im glad to help.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:General Discussion - November 14, 2020	labels:Does anyone with sewing experience have experience specifically with lining a garment that's already made? I'm big on embroidery and repair but i'm trying to line a denim shirt i have with some thrifted wool material i found a while back. I don't love how it feels on the arms so it's likely just gonna go on the torso.   Should i launder the wool, too? People say you can't wash wool but you absolutely can (carefully), and obviously not putting it in a dryer. I'm not sure if i'll do that, but for now i'm focused on making a pattern to line the western shirt.

"Tesla admits design flaw led to vehicle rear bumper falling off when driving in puddles of water"  You make luxury vehicles. Get the basics right and stop living in a Clarke and Dawe sketch, you drugged up weirdo.  But some of the comments in the [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/ht8m0b/tesla_model_3_rear_bumper_falling_off_issue_more/) on r/electricvehicles:  > If it's 1 in 100,000 chance, and there is no safety consequences - then service center is ok.  I'd say the bumper falling off when it gets wet is a *slight* safety issue.  > Anecdotal, but I've driven my 2018 Model 3 through two very large pools of water last year. No issues in general from that surprisingly.   TWO whole puddles? Well someone please give Mr. Musk his gold star.  > I can’t imagine many owners would go to the shop to get this changed out. I know I wouldn’t...waste of time.  A bigger waste of time than having to replace the ass end of the car after a little mist?  > My early 2020 model 3 bumper has visible gaps in the rear bumper that were not there on delivery. Like it's slowly getting pulled off. Tesla service tech told me it's normal defiation  Just...wow  > I would still take a Tesla with its QC issues over they comparable ICE vehicle.  To each their own, but personally I value my car arriving at its destination in one piece over method of propulsion.  This is early Kia level quality from a brand that wants to be considered exclusive and innovative; at least Hyundai and Kia made amends with a great warranty. And people are seemingly unbothered with having their $50,000+ car fall apart on them in completely normal driving conditions.
text:It's really bad. I don't even like the car that much. The acceleration is cool and the autopilot or whatever is really neat technologically but other than that it's....not a good car.   The windshield wipers *suck*. I personally don't really like the interior design or the massive infotainment stuff. I have a phone which way better technology to do all that and there's no where to mount it.   It has lots of gimmicks but it's really not worth the cost and the apologists for Elon's bullshit and the objectively bad cars they sell just makes it worse.   I think the biggest credits to Tesla/their vehicles are the safety ratings and the fact that they're making normal car manufacturers actually pursue electric vehicles. But man literally the ass falling off after driving through a bit of water is insanity and anyone defending it needs to stop licking Elon's shoes.	labels:	episode_done:True

This is more or less how your 60+ in-laws dress and they even make fun of themselves for having looking like crap when they go out like that. The combination of Norwegian salaries, the rain, and an utter disregard for how they look when they're out on morning walks makes for a lot of expensive technical wear and Salomon shoes.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 12, 2021	labels:Advice for Jeans  I’m someone that likes quality products that are fairly priced for their quality, and not priced for hype.  I want a pair of jeans that is good quality, but I don’t really want raw denim.  I know selvedge is a standard for really good denim, and I like the look of the cuff when it’s finished (I really like that look) but I don’t wanna pay the price tag or wear something that’s not comfy.  Also, I’m someone with athletic legs, so most nice fitting pants will fit my waist but not my thighs or butt.  Any advice on an athletic tapered jean that’s comfy, and maybe also has a cool pattern when cuffed?  I know this is a super specific ask
text:Selvedge denim is pretty uncommon already, selvedge denim that is also not raw is even more uncommon. Gap or American Eagle might have something, but it's not guaranteed.

I can distinctly remember driving all the way from Indianapolis back to Columbus once with these uncomfy jeans rubbing against my thighs the whole time, and I couldn’t get out of the pants fast enough.  I also know raw denim needs to be broken in and washed very uniquely.

If I'm out in the field I don't even try - it's jeans and t-shirts and PPE all the way. My [boots](https://xenaworkwear.com/collections/all-products/products/omega-eh) are from Xena Workwear and I had to send our EH&S guy that link after I bought them because he said they were "too fancy" to be safety shoes.  When I'm at my desk and know I won't be in the lab I dress up as much as I feel like, which for me includes skirts and heels. If I'm in the lab I wear pants with flats or oxfords and a nice shirt. I do love jewelry so I wear a fair amount of it, but except for the pieces I never take off (my watch and one necklace) if I have to go to the lab I take it off and lock it in my desk.   For me the secret to looking 1000% more professional and pulled together in the lab, especially when we have visitors, is a tailored lab coat (as opposed to an everyday lab coat). I have [this one](https://www.medelita.com/vera-g-slim-fit-womens-stretch-lab-coat.html) from Medelita but there is another company called Classico that makes tailored lab coats too. I'm thinking of buying my next one from them.

I find it very hard to find fashion influences for adult women that aren’t super basic, skewed super young, or just generic preppy “put a blazer over it!” J-crew style. The only place I see any creativity at all is in super high end fashion, but that’s not within the reach of most of us. The whole fashion industry in general is skewed so young, it’s like after 30 they think I should just wear a sack. The only reason the super high end brands cater to an older demographic at all is that older wealthy women are the only ones that buy their clothes. Any price point below that is plain plain basic city

Aritzia - I've been shopping there for well over a decade and while you really can't compare fabric from so long ago (it's incomparable imo) even just the stitching is becoming obviously bad. Last winter I saw a blazer, still on the rack in store, with threads already sticking out at the shoulder seam. Absolutely ridiculous. However, I will say their peacoats have turned around a bit - not what they used to be but a couple years ago they looked like they were made out of felt and definitely have gotten better since then.  American Eagle - I really like the new curvy fit of their jeans, 10/10, and I feel like the aerie underwear quality has gotten better, the last couple of years the material had gone downhill.

text:What did your mom teach you about fashion/style - and what did she not teach you?	labels:My mom has CURRRRRRLY hair, whereas mine is stick-straight -- so I identify with the struggle of her not being able to help you. For years I went to school with slept-on-wet, badly parted, staticy hair which I could only ever manage by putting in a ponytail (which was so long I might as well have been an actual horse.) I didn't know any better at the time, but I do recall seeing girls at my school with trendy haircuts and vaguely noticing they looked a lot better than me with my weird cowlicks. I may have been more stubborn about cutting my hair than I remember, but I don't recall my mom ever suggesting I should, say, use a product or learn to style it.  What she did teach me was about fabric content and garment quality. My mom used to sew, so she was no fool when it came to how something should fit, how surged seams wore compared to finished ones, and what would happen if a shirt was sewn off the grain (spoiler alert: it WARPS.)

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- November 04	labels:Hey guys. I work as a bartender and I'm looking for a hat to go with my uniform. My uniform is a pair of dark blue jeans, black button up with logo, either short or long sleeve, Black or brown shoes. I already have a flat cap picked out, just a simple cotton ivy cap in black. I wanted something else to mix it up a bit. I was thinking a trilby but I don't know if those are still in style or if it'd go with my outfit. Any advice is appreciated.

text:What are some habits that keep clothes/shoes new vs that habits that ruin them?	labels:For me, it is in how you launder the item.  I wash all my laundry on cold with as little detergent as possible (I do pretreat stains).  I will use mesh bags very generously and wash darker items inside out.  I never use the dryer (I'm allergic to dryer sheets) and hang dry everything on a  drying rack (or hanging from door frames on a hanger.

text:What's your fashion tragedy?	labels:I spent like two months investing in a bunch of nice wool sweaters that I could wear through the winter, put them in a separate laundry bin after wearing so I could launder them myself, but my ex washed and dried them on high heat and they all shrunk so badly that I couldn't even fit them on my dog. About $1500 gone.
text:This is why I don't really let my husband run the laundry too often. He's an amazing human, I love him, and there is so much he is good at; but laundry ain't it. He puts everything all in the same load, all on Hot water, and all in the dryer for an hour. If I left him to do it with no supervision, everything would be ruined.	labels:My partner is the same. He’s lived on his own before, has been doing his own laundry since he was a teen, but for some reason, he thinks you can just throw whatever fits in the washing machine together, then throw it all in the dryer. In his world, you can wash denim with rayon shirts and the only thing that truly needs to be hung up is his favorite Manchester United jersey (but only the one he paid extra for a players name on the back). The only thing I can think of is that men’s clothing really doesn’t need as much special care as often, since it’s mostly cotton or polyester with no special beading or designs.   I’ve tried so many times to explain it and he normally overcorrects when he does things wrong, but laundry just isn’t one. He grew up never recycling, now tries to recycle virtually everything. He used to never vote, and now will thoroughly research the local school board elections (and we don’t even have kids). Why can’t he do the same with laundry?!?!?	episode_done:True

text:Changing your mindset from fast fashion to one of investment pieces. What did you learn?	labels:One of the big things I learned is that there's a lot less room for error or experimentation with investments. I feel pretty fortunate that I had a pretty good idea of what I liked and didn't like, but I think if you're still wanting to experiment then it may be best to stick with very specific investments. For example, I started just with shoes (I have strong preferences) and outerwear (I wanted to upgrade shapes/colors I already loved). That'll help build confidence in moving to other areas.

text:When to start saving clothes for your children?	labels:Id say really only items that have some reason to be heirlooms or have family history or cultural value.  My mom died about 20 years ago.  I have an amazing pair of patchwork bell bottoms that were hers that I keep in a trunk, I have some pieces of jewelry.  I have two pieces of my grandmothers jewelry. I have a scarf that my other grandmother knit me that I'll keep.  I wear the scarf and one pair of earrings but the rest is sentimental, and I wouldn't want to keep lots and lots of volume of stuff for sentimental reasons.  Otherwise though its so hit or miss what your theoretical children will/won't need, like, or want to use.  Edit: I will add though that some of the culturally important items might be different.  There are still no guarantees, but it can be even harder to hold onto that part of one's family history when the family has emigrated, it may be worth more erring on the side of keeping if you have the space, at least until you're older and have a clearer picture.
text:That's really lovely - a few pieces are exactly what I was thinking of. And yeah, my mum's clothes have a lot more value to them to me because they're cultural clothes.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:General Discussion - November 26, 2020	labels:I've seen warnings about Gustin before but just wanted to relay my most recent experience as my own warning.   I ordered about five pieces a couple months ago and they're just starting to arrive. One of which was a pair of sweatpants. I followed their sizing guidelines (I'm 29 waist) and they recommended an XS. Already, red flags are apparent as I never wear an XS but I figure they know how their clothes fit, I'll go with it.   The sweatpants arrive and I try them on.  They are skintight and short. Not at all how I expected. The quality is there, just the sizing is way off the mark. So I email them asking if they can get me a pair that fit.   This is where things get real lame, real quick. Their customer service says they can exchange them. But *I* have to buy them from their store. They had two sizes left, S and XL. Kind of weird to direct someone to do so when inventory is so limited. Next, I have to go to the post office, pay for a shipping envelope and postage to return the original pair.   I really wanted to give them a chance so i ended up exchanging for a small to see if it’s a better fit but it’s been rubbing me the wrong way for a few days now. For this one pair of sweatpants I will have paid nearly an extra *$30 in shipping* while doing most of the work to process the exchange. I’m still due about 3 other pieces from them and am wondering if I’m going to go through the same ordeal if the fit guides are wonky for pants and shirts, too.   TL;DR Gustin is a hard company to take a gamble on but even if some of the clothes work out, based on my overall experience so far I can’t recommend them for the basics they provide considering the quality can be had for slightly more elsewhere but with a substantially better customer service experience.
text:[deleted]	labels:I did for the pants I bought and used that to inform the sweatpants (every time using their guide). That’s why I hold worry they’re not going to fit. Fit wouldn’t be such an issue if every purchase/return/exchange had the shipping tax. Also think it’s kind of ridiculous they don’t give you the option to batch your orders to save on shipping. Like, it’s already going to take months for my orders, what’s an extra few weeks to collect and ship at once and avoid $ in fees?  Oh and I diversified my orders so it wasn’t like they were all pants. Hoping the rest come out Ok, just a bad start	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 16, 2020	labels:I'm a smaller built guy (waist 28, and I like my trousers to end around my ankles, so length 28 too), and as such, have a couple of pairs of everyday wear tailored jeans that I use for most of my fits. I do tend to stick to streetwear, meaning mostly dark denim paired with hoodies/sweaters/bombers.  However, I've been branching out to more semi formal fits, and wanted to incorporate in textured suit trousers and linen trousers (etc) to pair with my sweatshirts, tucking them in for a bit of layering.  This is all well and good but with I tend to find more waist 29s and 30s from stores, meaning I need a belt - which by itself, is fine. But it tends to ruin some of these looks by adding heft to the look - I feel the fit looks cleaner without a belt and just with the top tucked in/flowing out a bit.  Maybe I'm overthinking this - but are there belt options won't add to the aforementioned heft while also being more discreet/less immediately noticeable?

text:FAQ: What is the environmental impact of different fabrics?	labels:I think a proper answer to this question would require a research team, a lot of money, and a lot of time. Here's some top-level things I know about various fabrics/materials:  * Cotton requires a lot of water to become a fabric. Especially anything that's "washed" like non-raw denim. (See Levi's Water-less line) * Any synthetic fabrics are made from fancy plastic and release micro plastics into the water every time you wash them. Even the tees and fleeces that are made from recycled plastics. There are [bags](https://www.patagonia.com/product/guppyfriend-washing-bag/GP001.html) and filters you can buy which supposedly cut down on the amount of micro plastics that actually make it into the water supply. I can't speak at all to how effective they actually are.  * Leathers of any kind require a lot of water and various "chemicals" to tan. Vegetable tanning is generally regarded as ~~better~~ less bad than chrome tanned leathers. * The excuse that "leather is a by-product of the meat industry" is basically a dumb trick of economics and the definition of "by-product". Meat is a larger industry and is more popular than leather so cows that are raise are more or less called "angus/beef" cows instead of "leather" cows because most of the money in them comes from the meat and not the hides. Farmers still make money off of selling the hides and such. If everyone stopped eating beef overnight then leather would no longer a by-product it'd be the main product. Don't get sucked into this excuse. * Fabric treatments, in general, are "bad". Waterproofing, non-iron, etc. * Washing clothes is "bad". Similar to how the majority of the environmental footprint of combustion engine cars comes from after they're sold, a large part of the environmental footprint of clothing comes from once it reaches your house. More specifically when you wash your clothes. Lots of washers aren't high-efficiency and use a lot of water, more energy if you don't wash on cold, dryers use a ton of energy, etc.   Hopefully someone else can talk about wool. I personally know nothing about it.  This is all really surface-level takes and there's more than enough nuance to go around that I've avoided in this comment. As always, if your primary goal is to have a small environmental footprint, there's a reason the order is reduce, reuse, recycle. Buy less.
text:I would also add that dyeing is, in general, "bad". There are a small number of brands that focus on undyed clothes, but for the most part, dyeing is a [very water and chemical intensive process](https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/sustainable-fashion-blog/2015/mar/31/natural-dyes-v-synthetic-which-is-more-sustainable). Some of the sustainability benefits of linen and hemp clothes (saved water in particular) are often tempered by the intense dyeing processes these fabrics go through to achieve color.   In terms of washing, hand-washing > front-load washers > top-load washers, both in terms of water use and effect on the lifespan of clothes.	labels:I wish it were easier to buy undyed/unbleached products- paper goods, clothes, linens, etc. I don’t need everything stark white.

text:Can we discuss how uncomfortable it can be to dress fashionably sometimes? Must beauty = pain? Looking for comfort tips!	labels:There's some outfits that are just not going to work for me if I'm prioritizing comfort, but often I can achieve a look while finding a soft, stretchy version of the garment.  I've learned a bit more about different types of fabric this year, and discovered that ponte knit is the type of fabric that most of my favorite things are made out of. It's similar to jersey, but double knit, so it's thicker and works really well for more structured garments like dress slacks or blazers. Having this language to search for clothes online has been a game changer for me. In the past I knew what I liked, but I didn't know exactly how to describe it, and now I do.  I'll tolerate slightly uncomfortable clothes for special occasions, but life is too short to spend every day feeling uncomfortable.

text:What are "iconic" items that you should know about, and their basic history? What items can singularly be identified as "starting a trend"?	labels:I'd like to call attention to the [double rider (DR) jacket or 'Perfecto,'](https://www.schottnyc.com/images/1300x2000/118_BLK_FNT_NEW1.jpg) which I find to be a very interesting symbol of how trends are appropriated and re-appropriated for various sociocultural reasons.  In WW1, German fighter pilots wore buttoned leather jackets with a [similar design DNA](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/59/49/f3/5949f3a8c74505394a3f87ac358b3574.jpg), a style adopted by the US military later in WW1. In the inter-war period in 1928, Irving Schott used this as a basis for the first-ever zipped motorcycle jacket - the Perfecto, after [his favorite type of cigar](https://www.cigaraficionado.com/glossary/perfecto) - following [a meeting with a representative from the zipper manufacturer Talon](https://books.google.ca/books?id=How0xeGhFM4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Fashion+in+Popular+Culture:+Literature,+Media+and+Contemporary&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiqrcK_qL_uAhW7EVkFHWRrCrQQ6AEwAHoECAEQAg#v=onepage&q=perfecto&f=false). These were quickly picked up by motorcycle enthusiasts, but it was only in the aftermath of WW2, when motorcycle-riding troops returned home and formed the first motorcycle clubs, that the DR started to acquire its cultural cachet as a garment for badasses and rebels. *The Wild One*, a 1954 film about an outlaw biker club, prominently featured [Marlon Brando wearing a DR](https://hips.hearstapps.com/autoweek/assets/s3fs-public/Marlon-Brando.jpg), further popularizing the style and its connotations.  A [leather subculture](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6602472695aad869fa060acf33c9314201ccfa1b/0_76_500_625/master/500.jpg?width=300&quality=45&auto=format&fit=max&dpr=2&s=88d47cacfeab4e1057579b2aac85a8ad) emerged in the 1940s from post-WW2 biker culture, wherein butch gay men began to adopt similar aesthetics -- resulting in gay leather bars for gay biker clubs. Symbolically, the DR took on associations of subversion of high and camp culture (that is, opposing the idea that gay men were necessarily effeminate, unmasculine, or effete), and became a symbol of free exploration of sexuality and kink. It was from this community that Rob Halford of legendary heavy metal band Judas Priest, which had previously had a sort of [rock-and-roll hippie aesthetic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=957N7EAtpY4), adapted his signature [leather-clad](https://i.redd.it/nj0essu7duiz.jpg) image in the 1970s, prominently including [DRs](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/8f/02/ca/8f02caef344b4087f629a0e67adca5eb.jpg). The coolness associated with the look, and the monolithic popularity of Judas Priest, resulted in it proliferating through the scenes of edgy music like heavy metal and punk.  Celebrities in the 80s and 90s also began to [co-opt the style](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/2e/6b/ca/2e6bcacb183189a0d1e091461897f859.jpg), no doubt influenced by the growing popularity of grunge music from Seattle, its punk/metal influences, and its [thrift-store chic aesthetic](https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/rs-soundgarden-bc5ba027-81b2-4310-892d-8605095d10c6.jpg?resize=1800,1200&w=1200). Since then, the DR has become so prominently associated with celebrity and wealth that it seemingly carries more heavy connotations of the former than its previous edginess and subversion. Dinosaur fashion critics have [bemoaned this transition at length](https://www.sz-mag.com/news/2017/05/context-changes-meaning/) because apparently it's cool to wear garments with 7 layers of appropriation (in Rabkin's case, military > biker clubs > leather subculture > heavy metal > punk > post-punk > "fashion") but not 8. In reality, the shift from counter-culture to "regular" culture is virtually inevitable, as edgy outsider aesthetics get defanged, normalized, and proliferated.  These days, you can still buy a Schott Perfecto, which is so ubiquitous as to have a [collaboration with Urban Outfitters](https://s7d5.scene7.com/is/image/UrbanOutfitters/36657054_001_b?$xlarge$&fit=constrain&qlt=80&wid=683), but my personal favorites lie with Japanese nerd brands (shocker, I know). For classic aesthetics, [Fine Creek Leathers](https://www.butterscotchlb.com/products/fine-creek-leathers-leon-custom) makes some truly incredible DRs I'd love to handle one day. For more modern or edgy aesthetics, the top of the heap in my view is still [Isamu Katayama Backlash](https://store-backlash.jp/?pid=157045626), a little-known brand overseas but super popular in Japan -- they dye and wash their leathers in-house, giving them [extremely nasty finishes](https://imgur.com/eOJOY4y) while still somehow managing to preserve strong quality control (unlike other brands that wash leathers, like Guidi).
text:God I’d die for a Katayama DR man, they’re just incredible, I’m scared of the sizing given them both being Japanese and making leatherwear and making WASHED leatherwear. What’s the sizeing usually like on them?	labels:Both the pieces I have (the depicted DR and a heavy denim jacket) are size 3/L, and I normally take a 38/Medium in US sizing. Be warned that they fit slim through the arms and body, sort of like Julius, and a new Backlash jacket is supposed to fit quite snug.

text:It depends how you want it to fit. Bedfords are meant to be worn slightly oversized. I don't know about recent seasons because their sizing may have changed, but when I wore mine maybe 4ish years ago I had my XS tailored a little smaller in the arms and torso. 5'7, 120lbs.	labels:Thanks for the info.

text:How do you handle budget increases when it comes to clothes? (ex. going from student to working professional)	labels:I finished up grad school last year and started working full time, so I totally went through that transition. For me, I don’t have a set clothing budget, but I do have a monthly “wants” budget that clothing purchases go into. I try to be strategic and identify gaps in my wardrobe and work from there, buying things as I have the money/need for them. It has been a big change going from mostly buying secondhand to having more to spend, but I still love to thrift/posh etc. My budget now is significantly more than it was in grad school though, so I have more flexibility.   One of the more difficult parts for me was feeling like I needed nicer, high quality items for work. Those get expensive! For example I recently bought a wool dress coat since I only had a parka. I am lucky in that my work is quite casual, so most of my wardrobe works for both work and casual stuff.	episode_done:True

I wanted another Pearl in the softer leather (safino is built to water and stain resistant), but I literally only wear one bag full time for years until it gives out. I have several other purses in a box under my bed but they get used once a year, if that.

I've always walked to class / for commute and waterproof footwear is a game changer. Honestly I think soggy feet should be banned, no one should have to suffer that!   Nowadays I have a pair of office appropriate waterproof boots and a pair of semi-hiking boots and my toes never have to feel the horror that is wet socks.

text:Has consulting a stylist really been a revelation to you?	labels:A little over a year ago, my mom brought me along to a party her friend was hosting with a color analyst.

To my utter surprise, I was identified as a cool summer -- which means blush pink, peach, slate grey, and all blues are in my range. As someone who previously limited myself to blacks, olives, and navy, it was a revelation. I look **AMAZING** in pastel pink. It makes me look like my skin is glowing!   Since then I've invested carefully in my new signature color with t-shirts, sweaters, hair bands, scarves, and special occasion dresses. I don't think I ever would have picked up a pastel if not for that party.  Edit: [Here's a photo of the first blush pink dress I bought.](https://imgur.com/a/AkLyhGN)

It'd be cool to have a fire-resistant coat just because and I can totally imagine, for example, Canada Goose (which is in the album) making something fire resistant since they brand themselves as a functional brand and not just fashion.	episode_done:True

Finding shirts that fit me is terrible and tiresome. Kohl's in house brand, Sonoma, used to have a line of shirts that fit me wonderfully and held their shape great. They were 54% cotton, 41% polyester, and 5% spandex. I still have two of them: https://imgur.com/a/ziacqLi  These shirts hold their form beautifully. I have large arms and other t-shirt arm holes will, over the course of the day, deform and stretch, becoming baggy on my arms. Call it vanity, because, well, it is, but I like my shirt sleeves to hold their form on my arms. The current line of Sonoma t-shirts are made differently. While they fit ok, the arms eventually stretch and the bottom of the shirt billows as it gets worm throughout the day. The large tall variants I have are slightly better in this area but not my much. The current composition is 50% polyester, 36% cotton, and 12% rayon. These shirts are very soft and overall they're really nice for the price, but I just much prefer the 5% latex versions. https://imgur.com/a/kBtLdd9  My issue comes from the fact that I cant find any shirts that are similarly constructed with the same or similar percentages. The only comparable options are gym shirts, which are fine for the gym, I already use some, but not for casual every day wear.  Do any of you guys now of any similar shirts? I looked on Kohl's website and thought I found the shirts but the ones they sent had the rayon instead of latex.

I definitely went through an awkward adjustment period when I switched up my style. My advice would be to go for it - buy an outfit you've been lusting over and get used to wearing it. Eventually it'll start feeling like you were always meant to wear it, and then you can buy more of the sort if you want. Just make sure you can trust the sizing if you're ordering online (I like shopping from Etsy sellers that take your exact measurements into consideration when making clothes for you).  I'd love to know what you end up doing and I'd love to see your new outfits if you get any!

text:Has consulting a stylist really been a revelation to you?	labels:I did one at a charity event being thrown by a wealthy-wealthy person I tangentially know.   I broke my arm on the way there (slipped on the sidewalk - I did NOT know it was broken). I bought three fingers of whiskey and drained it because my arm hurt.  I found a pair of sparkly shorts, and the stylist said that they thought those might be to "loud" for me.  They brought me pantsuits. I'm a stay at home mom with a side business selling things at farmers markets.   So for me? I got a terrible stylist who thought I was a drunk jabroni off the street.  I later told my friend I might not recommend that stylist to people in the future, and she was horrified I was treated that way. So I don't think it was Indicative of the profession. But funny story trying on clothes with a broken arm sucks!

text:Let's talk the impact of fragrance on perception of style! How much does a person's fragrance affect your impression of them? Do you choose perfume with this in mind? What are some of your favourites?	labels:I've always loved the quote of "fragrance is meant to be discovered, not announced", because it kinda reflects where I stand on fragrance *amount.* I'm always curious what people are wearing, but if it's overpowering, or the fragrance strongly lingers in the room long after someone has left it (ghost perfume!), it turns me off from the rest of the outfit and I tend to avoid the person. I'm not a fan of strong/intense smells.  I tend to associate flowery fragrances with twee and more dainty fashion choices, and more "masculine" (for lack of a better word) fragrances with alt, androgynous, and other such styles, so I tend to expect x fragrances if someone is wearing x outfit. But even if someone doesn't wear what I'm expecting, it doesn't really take away from the outfit too much.  I haven't worn fragrance in ages because my favourites were discontinued (DKNY Be Delicious and Katy Perry Meow). But based on my style nowadays (more masculine, lots of darker neutrals, odd silhouettes), I would probably choose something less sweet just to complement my outfits a bit more.
text:I think DKNY Be Delicious has not been discontinued, if you mean the classic original one. At least in Europe it is very easy to find on online retailers. It is a kind of classic on its way, a very popular, for good reason, fruity scent which has spawned lots of other scents.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- November 08	labels:Am I correct in assuming [the top is fleece and the bottom is terry](https://imgur.com/a/bGRGFAy)? Im trying to figure out if I can recognise the difference between the two.
text:They are different only in the way that the fabric is finished during manufacturing. With sweatshirt fabric (used to make hoodies, sweatpants, etc.), there are yarn loops formed on the back side of the fabric, this would become the inside of the hoodie when the garment is sewn.    With Sweatshirt Fleece, the yarn loops are shredded, which makes the inside of the hoodie soft and fuzzy.  With French terry, the yarn loops are left intact, which makes the inside of the hoodie moisture-wicking - that is, more absorbent and more breathable.	labels:I understand that already, but that's the point - the finish changes the properties of the fabric entirely and I want to be able to recognise the two so I know what to expect from a sweatshirt I'm buying.	episode_done:True

I'm 6ft tall, 135 LBS and have a really hard time finding pants that fit. I'm usually a 29 waist and 31/32 length. looking for the tucked in polo w/belt/dress boots/shoes. Any suggestions?  &#x200B;  Thanks.
text:Sounds like you have the fashion worlds ideal body but a difficult shape to dress in the retail world. Not sure why there's such a disconnect there but there certainly is.   Business Casual can be a great look for you because you're tall and lean. You're going to look really attractive in a tailored pant, with a fitted shirt and a skinny tie. Suiting and button downs are MADE for your build.   If you have the budget, head to Nordstrom and consider opening a card to earn the best deals and points. Suiting will add up. Brands to look out for are going to be AG Jeans, Frame LA, BONOBOS, Ted Baker, or TOPSHOP. TAILORING IS FREE ON ALL FULL PRICED ITEMS.  TopShop is going to be the most friendly for your budget, their sizing is very small and they offer extended sizes and have crazy deals. I always advise against fast fashion but if this is all you can afford for now, it is what it is.   If you're spending range is very very small, you'll want to head to ebay and poshmark and use the filters to find trousers in your waist and inseam or as close as possible. When buying used, you want the length to be right and to take it in to a trusted seller to have them tailored. TAILORING WILL MAKE A THRIFT STORE PIECE LOOK CUSTOM.   You're gonna have to roll up your sleeves and do some searching but once you get it right it will have been worth the labor.	labels:Well I appreciate it haha, I don't like being this skinny and want to be a little more filled out but it could be worse!  Good to hear, I really appreciate the advice I just think you're a little bit too fancy for the look I'm going for. I am going into real estate and need like a polo shirt no tie with some chinos/jeans/dress pants. Honestly won't be wearing suits/ties really ever other than weddings and such.   I wouldn't mind spending extra on some nicer clothing that can be tailored by them for free. That would be really nice I'll have to look into those brands although I think you may be referring more to suits.  I would rather stay away from cheap stuff. I want to buy once and cry once.  Yeah I really want to do it right get it tailored and be happy with something that will fit for a while. (body type won't be changing soon with my metabolism and lifestyle) haha.

text:20 Sweaters for Less Than $150, So You Can Achieve Peak Coziness - Esquire.com	labels:In my experience, sweaters are one of the few garments where there's a noticeable increase in quality as you spend more money.  Cheaper sweaters are noticeably thinner (both the threads and the sweater itself), which don't keep you as warm and don't last as long.   The good news is that there are some great options for getting high quality sweaters at low prices if you're willing to shop secondhand. For $150 you can find a gently used sweaters from Ines Meain and IMO that's a much better purchase than most of the cotton and fine merino wool sweaters listed in this article.

text:I've taken 566 outfit photos over 4 years (my style from mid-20s to 30)	labels:Re:working in fashion I completely agree. If you love a brand, don't ever go work for them. You end up becoming extremely disillusioned and see too many dark undersides. You learn these people don't actually have passion for the brand or the "vision" or the art, just passion for beating sales targets and convincing the mass population to buy more, more often. Those who try to steer the group in the right way, most times than not, get ignored and like all thing corporate assholes always win.  I left fashion retail and joined an outdoors retailer recently. I was so nervous I didn't know anything about bike parts or camping gear but all that didn't matter when it came to doing my job well. Now I can focus on doing my job well (and have fun doing it) and focus on really loving fashion the way I did before I started in the working world.
text:I wish I could stress to people how much I think this. So many fresh faces join this industry (naturally, as it's usually their first job and people come in with a genuine love for fashion) and so many leave disheartened.  Like you, I know so many people who have left fashion retail, to move onto non-fashion (e.g. homewares, food, FMCG) because, IMO and their opinion, there is just far too many negatives to the fashion retail industry and you get to a point where you feel like it'll never change. So you want out.  I'm moving back home to Australia in a few months and know I won't be going back to fashion retail. I don't regret having worked in it as the lessons learnt about the harm of fashion retail is invaluable and eye-opening, but mentally, it's time to move on.	labels:Thank you for sharing your story about corporate fashion retail.

I scratched up my lenses and am too lazy to fix them so I wanted a nice cheap lens to keep as an extra while I go to repair my old ones. I always wanted to try a circle lens, but always thought I would look bad with them. However, I took a chance and bought them (from Zenni as well!!) to be honest when I first tried them on, I thought I made a huge mistake, but after the initial shock, I am in love with them and now am completely unmotivated to fix my old pair (the price to fix the old pair would be more than me buying these new glasses)!!

I needed a distraction today and this was an amazing and unexpected read. I happen to be partnered to someone who, in many parts of our country, would likely assumed to be gay because he dresses in loud prints or colors at times. Where we live, no one bats an eye. It fascinates me how, for straight men, their sexuality is so heavily policed through their clothing. The most interesting part of this article in particular is how his addiction is all wrapped up in both sex and buying fashion, and I wonder how much of that is a result from how policed he’s always felt.	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - February 16, 2021	labels:Hi. I was wondering if anyone could tell me the exact type of Hanes shirt this goes with. Every Hanes t-shirt I've bought in the past has been garbage except (ironically) the one I got for free. The tag is virtually identical to this one:   https://images.app.goo.gl/bDUY8Mp88wZJzw7EA   The only differences between this picture's tag and mine are that mine is "XL/TG/XG" instead of "L/G/G" and the bottom right most number is 35 instead of 17.   What I'm looking for is the exact shirt made by Hanes that this belongs to (I keep finding Hanes shirts with tags nothing like this or ones with tags that are sort of close but the shirts are garbage) or just a link to where I could buy this exact "model". This is a crewneck t-shirt. Thank you in advance.	episode_done:True
text:What are your go-to basic fall tops? I’m talking long sleeve tees, sweatshirts, turtlenecks etc!	labels:I prefer layers myself as an hour glass figure.  Big and boxy makes me look like sponge bob.   I like a thin sweater made with silk blend, leather coat, awesome scarf.  Good fitting pants and heeled boots.  I love fall.  Last year I bought a BRIXTON Fiddler Fisherman Cap and I really want to wear it again.
text:Do you have brand recommendations for the fitted sweaters? I also do not enjoy the boxy look that is popular these days.	labels:No I don't.  I am having a hard finding them myself.   I did pick up a mock turtle that had a V pattern of ridges that did a good job of muting my DDs.    Ever wear a vertical wide ridge sweater.   Omgosh.

text:A discussion about “knockoff culture”	labels:Logos are *trademarked. Clothing designs are... a more grey area. Like, a v neck knit sweater can only be designed so many ways, you know? However there are some instances where parts of a design are copyrighted, like i think the red soles on Loubitons, which i cannot spell, are copyrighted/trademark. Prints and artwork are a whole other story.  There are a lot of factors and copyright and intellectual property law also differs from country to country - there is no international copyright law, just general agreements between specific countries.  I personally feel that knockoffs and replicas are different. Replicas are illegal as they are faking an item AND copying the logo. Knockoffs that just copy the design... not illegal, generally speaking. Ethical? Truly depends on the situation.  In your specific examples, yeah theyre probably inspired by Sezane but tbh theyre not really dupes, there are clear design differences in each example.
text:I've watched a video on this and I think you're right.  Also, I think the argument is that a knock-off is not going to steal market share from the original. Those who want to and can afford a high end designer brand aren't going to buy a knock-off and those who do probably can't afford the original.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Is it disgusting to not wear socks with shoes?	labels:The only hard and fast answer to this question is that it depends on the person. Some people have feet that get smelly and sweaty easily, and others don't. But people are more likely to judge *your* choices on their experiences with their own feet rather than yours.  So if someone gets sweaty feet that make their shoes disgusting without socks, they will probably not realize that's not the case for you. So they will judge you for not wearing socks. Doesn't really make sense, but that's the way it is. Also, feet are a really polarizing thing in general. Some people are really disgusted by feet (as evidenced by all the comments at the bottom of this thread), and the thought of sockless feet in shoes might be repulsive to them.   All that being said, there are definitely shoe styles that look better without socks, like your vans for example or any kind of plimsolls or boat shoes. I would just wear no-shows with those types of shoes. If someone doesn't understand that it's in fashion to wear them without visible socks, who gives a fuck. They're the one who is wrong. But if you want to completely avoid judgment by everyone, the safest option is just wearing socks.	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 28, 2020	labels:This has been at least a ten year saga for me. I cannot get jeans the way I want, and I’ve probably tried over fifty brands at this point.  All I want are nice, dark jeans that fall completely straight on me, all the way through to the opening. I see this on practically every brand’s website in their model pictures:  https://us.mavi.com/collections/men-relaxed-straight-leg-jeans/products/matt-deep-rinse-soft-move  But virtually every pair of straight leg jean crumples and looks like crap on me, regardless of inseam. This is to say nothing of narrower cuts (slim, etc.) as I detest that look on a man, especially if it has any taper. Makes a man look like humpty dumpty in my opinion.  My only option to date has been bootleg (usually too flared) or a straight/relaxed straight where I make a ~1” cut on the inseam at the opening to get them to fall straight over the shoe. But then I have a cut in my jeans :).  Somewhat recently, perhaps on here, it was recommended to me to buy a pair and have a tailor craft them as I want.  Great idea. I was excited.  I tried. This was a tailor I trust and does great work. I went through at least six different iterations with her, changing sometimes in as small as, no joke, 0.25” increments (diameters here). We took a pair of Levi’s boot and worked the part below the knee, the opening diameter, and the length.  I thought they were done. Then I walked around today and caught myself in the mirror. STILL this crap:  https://i.postimg.cc/3w0B2Bnn/596-BE6-B0-BF29-422-E-9145-817-B987598-ED.jpg  I want to blow my sartorial brains out :)  Is it because my thighs are large or something? I’m a 29”x32” so it’s not like I’m big. I just do not understand why I can’t get a pair that lay like this:  https://us.mavi.com/collections/men-relaxed-straight-leg-jeans/products/matt-deep-rinse-soft-move  That’s just one example pic amongst millions I can find. I seem to have bought them all. Nothing works. What the hell is wrong?

However, wondering if you guys knew of a brand and cut that is roomy through the seat and crotch but still gives an excellent slim look through the leg opening for an excellent cuffed look. I'd love to get them for under $75 but for selvege denim that may be near impossible. I live in the US  &#x200B;  EDIT: Anyone here try the "GOODTHREADS" Amazon brand?

text:Hmm, are yours regular fit? It sounds like you're looking for a tapered fit, i.e. roomy top block and tighter legs.   I find that Uniqlo's regular fit is tapered, compared to LVC for example. Did they fit properly in the waist? I'd assume that you're just not used to the "regular" fit. No jeans from Uniqlo are baggy really. Post a pic and show us if you want to.

text:I need help with getting rid of clothes	labels:Hi! As a stylist I get this question ALOT. For starters don't get rid of too much before buying replacements. What ends up happening is we get rid of everything without establishing what pieces we actually need.   Start with establishing your personal style. What do your want your closet/style to be? What do you want to look like on the day to day?   Next, set aside pieces that don't fit you well. If there is potential to have the piece tailored then get that done. Key here is to just set these pieces aside but dont get rid of them yet until you find a replacement just in case you HAVE to wear it again.   Lastly is shopping! Now that you have a moodboard and list of things you need you can shop to fin in the gaps and more importantly you can shop with intention!   &#x200B;  I hope that wasn't too much and was helpful haha. I'm always happy to help.
text:That's actually really helpful! How do you suggest finding my style? I feel like I have such a wide style that I wear (minimal, to punk, to cutesy, etc). I feel like I love all of my clothes but some go months without being worn.	labels:I think it’s fine to have multiple styles and even clothes you don’t wear that often. Maybe be more conscious in your purchases about how often you’ll wear something but if you already own it and love it there’s no rush to get rid of it just because it’s not an everyday piece.	episode_done:True

I have some more expensive, sustainable items I’ve added in the last couple years but the majority of my closet still includes “fast fashion” basics that have lasted quite a while and I won’t be tossing anytime soon. Curious to hear more discussion here - from an environmental standpoint, I’d think it would be better to buy less overall regardless of manufacturer, and when you do *need* to buy something, seek out more sustainable or ethical brands or thrift?

text:When/why did you get your first really fancy purse/bag?	labels:This’ll probably sound terrible but here we go ha.     My first serious boyfriend really influenced me a lot. I was 18 when we met, he was 24, and I just wanted him to like me and think I was cool. He very expertly put me on a pedestal with phrases like “I love that you don’t wear a ton of makeup like other girls” or “I fucking hate nose rings, I’m glad YOU don’t have one”. I took pride in not being like other girls.     One thing my ex hated (and when it came to women and their fashion choices, the list was long) was designer labels and bags especially. He’d see some woman minding her own dang business with a LV bag on her shoulder and he’d roll his eyes and make some comment on how flippant she must be with money and how “retarded” (sorry :/) she is and how glad he is that *I’m* not like that. So on and so forth. I could literally go on like this on a million similar topics. He was a Really Nice Guy and also said if I got a nose ring he’d tell me how fucking ugly I was every day until I took it out.       HOWEVER! Life of course moves on. We broke up (thank god.) I grew older, I ended up falling in love with my best friend and we got married! Wahoo! But one thing really irked me. I still didn’t care for handbags. I felt like they were wasteful and unnecessary. Which is a fine and okay opinion to have - just don’t buy any then - but I couldn’t work out if I’d always felt that way or if I felt that way because he so completely molded that bit of my personality. And that, to me, is *not* okay.        I finally decided I did want a bag - for nice nights out to dinner where usually I’d just hold my phone in my lap. My husband heard me hemming and hawing away about Kate Spades (which, I know aren’t crazy expensive but I really can’t get my head around expensive handbags but baby steps ha) and he asked if he could buy me one for Christmas a few years ago.     So there it is! Lol. I have a mediumish cross body in tusk, I think, with a black bottom and black strap. I bought an adorable black cat wallet that kinda goes with it. and no one will ever *ever* influence me to that extent again. If it goes inside or on my body and is obtained with my money then it is *my* choice.	episode_done:True

text:Review: Brunello Cucinelli Men's Deerskin Derby Shoes	labels:Regarding what you said about Leather smell, tanned leather actually has a smell of it's own which historically was quite unpleasant [\(owing to the use of Urine or Alkali solutions\)](https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Tanning_\(leather\))  and so the "smell of leather" as we know it was created to scent the tanned leather products and mask the unpleasant original smell.     It is quite possible that a manufacturer with modern methods of tanning is able to avoid the unpleasant smell entirely and hence has no need for the "leather scent" to disguise unpleasant odor.     Bonus Section:    Cuir De Russie ([Russian Leather](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia_leather)) is a type/family of  fragrance  that were used for Russian made leathers which differed in process from the other more common methods of tanning.   [Chanel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuir_de_Russie) and  [Guerlain](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Guerlain/Cuir-de-Russie-29336.html) are based around this leather's scent.

text:[Serious answers only] FAQ: Why does runway fashion looks like nothing you'd ordinarily wear on the daily?	labels:The best response I’ve ever heard for this question was comparing runway high fashion to the concept cars you’ll see at auto shows. Those cars will often never make it into production but that’s not the point. The point is to show off new materials, technologies, design philosophies or to generally stir up interest in a brand. Same for fashion.
text:This is just incorrect though.  RTW runway shows are literally a showcase of the products that will be available to buy in the following season. They exist to show off the collection to buyers who can then decide which pieces they want to order for their stores.  Sure, the most elaborate runway pieces may not be picked up by many stores, and conversely some more basic pieces from the collection may not be shown on the runway, but by and large what you see is what you get.  —-  To answer the OP: high fashion brands aren’t trying to create average / generic / everyday clothes. Generally the designer has some kind of aesthetic vision or “world” that they create the collection to fit into.  Sometimes, this vision is actually pretty accessible; e.g. brands that essentially make “rich people basics”, from Brunello Cucinelli and Ralph Lauren to Lanvin and The Row.  On the other end of the spectrum you’ve got designers who build their own fantasy world - Rick Owens is the prototypical example of this. While Rick does have some more accessible / “normie” pieces, you need to kind of buy into his world to really appreciate the majority of his pieces.  And then there are tons of other points in between these two extremes.  - Dries Van Noten essentially makes fairly traditional tailoring (and other familiar silhouettes), rendered with a heavy dose of bold prints, embroidery, and luxury fabrics.  - Ann Demeulemeester makes romantic goth clothes. Stuff wouldn’t look out of place in a period vampire movie, but is done with much more finesse than straight cosplay.  - Haider Ackermann’s world is a collage of cultural references, always with a kind of “elegantly disheveled” vibe and with lots of explicitly luxe fabrics (especially jacquards and velvets)  These are just the brands I feel somewhat qualified to give a reductive one-paragraph summary of, but essentially all high fashion brands can be placed somewhere on this spectrum.  The final thing to note is that a key difference between runway shows and real life, for every brand, is that the runway _styling_ is never trying to look “effortless” or worrying about “overdressing” or “trying too hard” - they are an unapologetic showcase of the collection in its purity. By contrast, the outfits people end up wearing in the real world with those same pieces will tend to be more restrained.	labels:This is 95% the case , a lot of RTW runway shows have a number of samples that are otherwise rejected by buyers or are more couture-esque by nature for the show	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else hate literally everything they put on?	labels:I found getting an independent personal stylist revolutionary. I was never happy with what I wore before her now I know exactly what goes with what and what accessories to wear. I know it’s not the most affordable option (think it worked out to about $150/h plus clothes) but if it’s important to you maybe something to save up for?

text:Are our ideas about what looks “dated” on either ourselves or others affected by or correlated with our age?	labels:My favorite comment about being dated is [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/hxpp50/What_are_signs_that_someone%E2%80%99s_style_hasn%E2%80%99t_changed_in_10_or_20_years%3F_Do_you_consider_that_a_problem%3F/fz8z0qk/) from a past post.  >This can be a really hard question to answer without offending people - anyone who provides specific examples will be met with: *"well, it's not dated when I style it,"* or *"Noooo but I love x and I will never stop wearing it but also don't want to be dated,"* or *"Who even cares if what you are wearing is dated?"* So instead I'm going to potentially offend everyone by trying to break down what is happening here.   >**What are the merits of not-looking-dated v. what are the merits of not caring?**  >If you opt out of caring about what is or is not fashionable, you are psychologically freeing yourself from the pressure of having to meet what may seem like arbitrary standards. However, you also have to be the kind of person who doesn't mind being judged for this decision or being perceived as someone who is not entirely with the times.   >On the other hand, some people opt into wanting to seem with-the-times because it removes the psychological pressure of judgement for not fitting in. Or maybe they really enjoy the trend cycle, and like that styles change frequently because they find it fun to indulge in new looks. However, they may feel a lot more pressure to keep up with things, spend more money, and be judged by people for being frivolous/buying into wasteful trend cycles.   >Align yourself with whatever viewpoint you want.  >**How can I wear beloved item x that people say is dated without looking dated?**  >This is called wanting to have your cake and eat it too.  >One option is to align yourself with Camp A above, accept that you are wearing something dated, and accept that you do not care. This means that if people say what you are wearing is dated, you don't cry "nooooo!". Instead, you just say, "lol okay, but I like it". Analyze the thing you like, understand WHY you like it, and if that is worth being perceived as dated. Maybe it is.  >Another option is to branch out and try new things. Are you sure that you hate the new style that has replaced old style? Or are you just having a knee jerk reaction? Maybe you look really good in the new style and don't know it yet!   >And maybe you've heard that "trendiness" and "style" are different things, and that you can be "stylish" without being on trend. That is true - but also be aware that having a "style" that is not "on trend" can be polarising as well. It's not a free ticket to having your cake and eating it too. This is an acceptable option. It comes with accepting that some people will think you look amazing, and other people will think you look ghastly.   >**What if the old style looks great on me and the new style looks terrible on me?**  >Make sure your eyes don't just need to adjust to the new silhouette. There's also never just one silhouette that is in style, so chances are there's a way to make the newer fashions work for you. Having the right body type for the old style does not automatically negate it being dated.  >**Thing x isn't dated where I live - and I haven't even seen anyone wearing new thing**  >Yeah, none of our experiences are monolithic. We have people posting here from all over the world, and the trends in Tokyo are not the same trends as in London or as in Dubai or as in New York. And then people in Auckland aren't even in the same season. And those are just big cities - even within the US people dress differently. Central PA is different than Western WA in terms of what people wear day-to-day. You know your own experience best, but it doesn't mean that what someone is reporting about *their* location is wrong. If your outfit is not dated where you live, then great! No one thinks you are dated. They may even think you look crazy for wearing some new trend that no one is wearing there yet. So you can choose whether to fit in with your surroundings, or follow fashion blogs from New York after weighing the pros and cons of both.  >**Who even cares if what you are wearing is dated?**  >Look, I don't LIKE all of this. I don't like that people love to be judgmental and categorize other people. But it is something that people do. Yeah, not giving a fuck gives you a certain type of power, but it also gives you certain deficits. Giving a fuck also gives you a certain type of power and gives you certain deficits.   >This is what being a woman is. It's running in circles trying to meet standards that came from ???   >Sometimes you're in that mood like, "What should I opt into this/care? I should do things for myself" and other times you are like, "Gah, I need to meet all societal expectations perfectly so that I don't feel bad about myself!"  >You can't win. A lot of people just pick an option and justify their choice with whatever makes them feel the best for their situation.   >**And what side, may I ask, are you on?**  >I oscillate between *"I'm going to wear comfy clothes because I have chronic pain, and my fear of the judgement of looking blah does not outweigh my physical discomfort in the moment,"* and *"I want to have a distinct personal style but one that adapts to the current silhouettes. I'm not necessarily achieving that, but it's an attempt."*

text:Dressing 'out of time' (vintage/history bounding)	labels:I don't *intentionally* dress historical on a day to day basis, but because I have a passion/profession for historical costume and a habit of wearing exactly what I like, it was bound to happen eventually.  I wouldn't wind yourself up too much about historical clothing; there's this myth floating around the public consciousness saying that historical women's fashion is always over-the-top, uncomfortable, impractical, expensive and hard to pull off, and while certain elements of historical high fashion *can* be pretty ridiculous, we can't forget the literal *millions* of women who, over the course of centuries, woke up every morning, put their shift and stockings and boots and stays and bum and petticoats and gowns and mitts and caps and mantles and *lived life*--and they lived without air conditioning, washing machines, showers, cars, Target, Amazon, or any of the other things that we have come to depend on to make our own modern clothing choices *seem* practical.    When it comes to clothing, we have a *lot* that we can learn from historical women. It's not just wanting to look like you stepped out of a frock flick; it's the attention to flattering shapes, and the sturdy, sensible, yet beautiful construction.  It's being warm in the winter and cool in the summer.  It's having freaking *pockets* in all sorts of fun places, and little tucks and laces that you can let out when you eat too much.  I mean, I guess there's plenty of people who are *only* interested in the 'look,; but, to my eye, a superficial approach often provides superficial results.  Which is fine, if that's what you want.  But since we're  naming the names of Rachel Maksy and Bernadette Banner, I think it's worth noting that they *own* historical the way they do because they *think* about historical style the way they do.  In fact, I think *everybody* could benefit from that more lifestyle-oriented approach to fashion, even if the historical look isn't what they're going for.  With that lecture given... I shop almost entirely vintage--buying new is almost entirely pointless since manufacturing quality has plummeted, even for higher-end clothing. Finding a good recently-made garment will take twice as long and cost ten times as much. If I can't find something no matter how hard I look, *then* I'll sew it, but I find that it's mostly unnecessary to sew things like midi skirts and blazers when I live on a planet that's floundering with its excess of unwanted clothing.  The thing you want is almost certainly out there.  Be patient.  If the plague ever ends, make a habit of checking thrift stores regularly, and don't be afraid to walk out empty-handed if they happen not to have anything that's right for you.  For quarantine shopping, Poshmark is fine (eBay is a little more hit-and-miss in terms of sellers accurately describing their clothes, but it works too) as long as you pay close attention to fiber content, measurements, descriptions--and avoid sellers who can't give you any clear answers.  Any time you shop online you'll have to budget for fail!purchases, but I find that *most* of my online vintage purchases turn out alright when I shop carefully.  So far I've had no issues with society when it comes to my way of dress.  I get mostly compliments; sometimes people with the best of intentions will ask me what I'm "all dressed up" for, which is kind of an obnoxious way to confront somebody who's dressed the same way they dress everyday... but I try to remember that they're not insulting me on purpose.  They *like* what they see, they just don't know what to make of it.  The *real* social downside is that you're going to become a magnet for misogynists.  You will be "complimented" on your "femininity," your "class," and your "modesty--" you're not like *other women*, who are trashy--no, *degenerate*--because they dared to get a tattoo and show cleavage.  Never miss an opportunity to tell those men that they're garbage; they get their hopes up, you see, when they spot a lady who looks the way they want us to, and like to imagine that we might be sympathetic to their ass-backwards vision of society.  So it is of the utmost important that their dreams be crushed, ruthlessly, under the weight of your dainty French heel.  And, dude, looking at guinea pigs makes me want a guinea pig.  They are so unfairly cute.  I'll bet I could convince my sister to paint portraits of them, too.  Alas, after years of searching for a man that jigs to my old-time jive and *isn't* a human wastebasket, I found one who is allergic to rodents :(

Works as a mid layer in cold months or as the only thing over a pair of shorts in the summer and will be at home in a bunch of different styles. I like my Todd Snyder / champion one.  - Slim straight or straight dark wash or black jeans. As close to a “must own” piece of clothing as exists. - A good pair of boots. I like my RM Williams a lot at the moment, but something like a service boot or Chukka is equally useful. Great for all the situations “in between” sneakers and something more formal.  - Long coat like a duffle or balmacaan. Cool way to standout when it seems like every dude in existence has transitioned to patagonia or other down jackets for winter casual outerwear.

text:I Dyed My Jeans With $6 Dye and Here Are The Results	labels:I think the Rit Fixative is a new product, or at least not widely available. I've spent many an hour dyeing clothes over the past decade and had never noticed the fixative as one of their products until the past year or so. Rit is a combination of different chemical types of dyes, which is why it works on so many fabric types, but also why it fades quickly. For a long time, it was the only dye that was readily available to the public. I suspect adding the fixative to their line was a way to compete with the more speciality (higher quality) dye makers out there. They've also updated their color line over the past several years to add trendier shades (neons, etc.) and they have a fun color recipe guide online that it really accurate and helpful.
text:Oooh that makes so much more sense - both why many blogs don’t mention the fixative and also why Rit Dye is so much more predominantly mentioned on denim dying resources than any other dye (because it was the only thing available for so long)	labels:Rit does have some sort of fixative already in their formula, otherwise it would wash out immediately. I've not ever used the separate one, and haven't had an issue with dye transfer in the laundry - but I'm also pretty selective about washing like colors together, and minimizing the amount of laundry I do to preserve the clothing lifespan.  I've always had great results from Rit - I can only think of one garment of dozens that really turned out badly, and I'm pretty sure it was a fiber content issue.	episode_done:True

text:What style rules or clothing attributes are you ruthless about?	labels:On myself I prefer a very structured silhouette on my upper body - I don't buy anything that's not either a high crew neck or a mock/turtleneck. Only exception is plunging v-necks for formal occasions, and the occasional camisole (but those are mostly for layering under sheer items). Actually one other rare exception is cowl necks that hit high on the neck as well.   I won't buy items with a drop shoulder unless the garment has a lot of structure or a pattern that visually will expand my shoulders to counteract the effect of the drop shoulder.   No silver hardware, I've got gold facial jewelry so I've made my choice.  I used to agree with some of the other commentators on not buying items that have details that negate the item's function - ie sleeveless sweaters - but I've been getting a little bored of all that functionality and I'm trying for more layering. Sleeveless sweaters I'm excited about so that I can layer them over my existing button downs or thinner knit long-sleeves. I'm also very into sheer layers so that I can add some excitement to my more functional outfits without overheating all the time.	episode_done:True

text:[Serious answers only] FAQ: Why does runway fashion looks like nothing you'd ordinarily wear on the daily?	labels:The best response I’ve ever heard for this question was comparing runway high fashion to the concept cars you’ll see at auto shows.

Same for fashion.

text:What are some differences between stereotypical Millennial and Gen Z fashion/aesthetics?	labels:I think in this conversation it’s sort of difficult to tease apart what was millennial style 10 or so years ago, when millennials were a comparable age, from how millennials dress now, which is more heavily influenced by the fact that we work/have kids/are not in high school now.  As for why sustainable brands are more millennial, it’s because sustainable brands will never be cheap, and ideally the clothing should have some staying power. Younger people don’t have tons of money and also tend to switch it up more often. A sustainable brand would have a harder time marketing to that.
text:Yeah, it doesn't make sense to me to compare modern millennial fashion with modern Gen Z fashion. They're at different points in life, of course their styles will be so different.	labels:Finally somebody said it. Because guess what? Millennials were dressing just as risqué 10 years ago we they were teens and young adults. Mini skirts, tiny cut off denim shorts, tight jeggings, wearing leggings as pants, sheer button up shirts with a visible bra, the whole American Apparel hot pants trend, bandage skirts and dresses, tiny tight t shirts with the whale tail thong in low rise jeans, I mean I can go on...  The point is that while the trends are different between generations, the intention to dress uniquely, flashy and risqué in your teens and early 20s is no different.	episode_done:True

text:How to build an age-suitable varied chic wardrobe?	labels:>French chic and preppy school girl  Have you ever heard of the brand Claudie Pierot? It's suitable for your age, but it's really perfect for this. It's probably too pricey, but maybe you can copy that style elsewere. Also, I am East Asian - women tend to look very young and our fashion is geared a lot towards looking youthful as well. Maybe you can get some inspiration with how we style stuff too.  Anyways, I remember how hard it was as a teen to hear "dress however you want and don't worry about it" from people and have it mean anything (hell, that's the case for me even now in my mid-thirties). So I'll just say this - people will definitely notice if you dress differently than them, but they are less likely to think you're trying "too hard" if you don't act differently (better or different than them, seeking validation, etc. etc.) because of how you dress or if you avoid drawing attention to your clothes specifically (like name dropping brands or styles or being not willing to go certain places or do certain things because you're not dressed appropriately).	episode_done:True

It's actually more of a charcoal grey. I still need a black one! I also need a bright red one.  Another concern that  I forgot to mention. Since the fit is loose and it has that 50s style flair at the bottom, paired with the gingham pattern, and paired with the slim fit clothes that comprise most of my wardrobe...is it possible that it looks a bit too feminine?

I ended up getting [the olive color g-pants](http://imgur.com/a/BtkYCcL) which I got today.   The problem is, I feel supremely indifferent towards the pants. I'm sure I'll wear it sometimes, but I don't really love it.   What do mfa veterans do in this situation? What do you do with a purchase you don't love or hate? Do you usually return it or do you usually keep it?
text:If I don't love something it's a return  typically.  That being said I think it's good to reflect on what your were expecting/thinking when you bought them and compare that to how they actually fit and look on you. It will ideally help you mage better purchases that align with the style you want	labels:That's a solid advise. Thank you.

text:How do comfort vs. style compare in what bottoms you wear?	labels:I mostly wear jeans/pants and I find them to be very comfortable personally. I'm honestly always a little surprised that they're so uncomfortable for most people. Most of my discomfort in skirts/dresses is mental (I just don't feel like me when I wear them).   I think if you enjoy wearing skirts you should keep wearing them, nothing wrong with that. If it's a seasonal thing maybe fleece stockings or something like that will allow you to wear them in the cooler months.
text:I have found people overwhelmingly wear clothes a size too small (like speaking to friends and whatnot). My sister, for example, buys the same size leggings as I do despite her hips and waist being 5-6 inches larger than mine, and then complains about them being see through. I have strong suspicions that this is the reason people find thongs horrifically uncomfortable as well.	labels:Once I realized that low rise jeans were more for me (bc I have a very short torso) pants became much more comfy for me!

text:Tips for feeling confident when wearing stylish clothes around family?	labels:Ease into it slowly. Start with a few blouses that are more your new style preference, and wear them with jeans/leggings. It'll instantly add a bit of polish without looking too different. In the cool weather now, sweater dresses are sexy and stylish but also not too far off from a hoodie. long sweeping cardigans over sleeveless blouses/tops and leggings means that you can probably wear that same top when it gets warmer without the outer layer and people will already be used to it.     Also, Chances are there will still be days you want to wear that super comfy soft hoodie so keep some of your favs (take it from someone who found themselves owning zero sweat pants at the beginning of quarantine and had to walk live around in "dressy" pants for a few weeks). But also, there's nothing quite as comfy as a baggy hoodie on the weekend or if you just want to run out to do a quick errand without getting fully dressed up.	episode_done:True

text:How different is your actual heel length vs what it's advertised as and, how much does it change by shoe size for you?	labels:I am size 5.5 US, 35 international, 3-3.5 UK and honestly two inches (50mm) is about as high as I’m willing to go for all day wear. You’re right, smaller feet makes the slope quite extreme. A lot of designer shoes are 70, 80 or even 100mm and I just cannot imagine ever doing that
text:I agree, I wear a 6, but tend towards the smaller side of the size and wore a 5.5 in high school and college before I started walking everywhere. I have a really high arch, though, so I can make 4-5 inch heels work for date nights because they shift me fully onto my toes and the balls of my feet. Anything in the 2-4 inch range just feels like my feet are sliding forward and end up being really uncomfortable.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How to find the confidence to wear clothes you like?	labels:Unless your mom is a stylist or a chemical engineer, know that what she is saying is out of a place of love and concern, but probably 100% factually incorrect.  Unrelated, I feel like the mark of adulthood is when you realize/come to the reckoning that what your parents say or have ever said is usually coming from a place of deep love, but is 100% factually incorrect.  (Gestures broadly at literally everything they have made that is killing us and the planet)  Your mom grew up in an age where there were like, 10 solvents for cleaning.  We now have thousands.  Don't worry.  Wear your pants.  I also feel irrationally upset at this boomer scare mongering, which has been done by women raised 1940's-1980's to intentionally scare, control and oppress young women, in the name of good intentions. Meanwhile, real threats are totally ignored or unaddressed.   Anyway, wear the pants.  The only way to do a thing is to actually do it.	episode_done:True

text:Have you ever gotten tons of compliments on something but are still on the fence?	labels:>how I felt in them was more important than how people saw me in them.  Well, i came to say this but you already said it.  A great example is probably many of our parents - my mom will always compliment me on things that do NOT suit my normal style.  And she'll use words like "cute" which just makes me feel degraded and belittled.  I am not "cute" i am a force of nature to be reckoned with, which is why i dress in mostly black with studs and spikes and bones.    The hair is a different flavour than an item of clothing, but ultimately it's your hair.  I agree it's so much easier to not dye hair, but when i let the purple wash out of mine and i see my blonde self in a mirror, i feel like a washed out copy of myself until it's purple again.  Yes, it's a ton of work, but for me it's totally worth it.  For you, it's not, and that is 100 % okay.
text:>A great example is probably many of our parents - my mom will always compliment me on things that do NOT suit my normal style.   Ooof, I feel this. Especially the “cute” bit. I know she sees me differently than I see me, but my peers always got to be cool or gorgeous or sexy or badass... and I was just cute, which was the last thing my self-image issues needed. I’ll wear the stuff she’s already gotten for me, because I need something to cover (just cover, not emphasize!) my butt, but no more; I’ve finally gotten the backbone to tell her even if *she* likes XYZ on me I won’t have any part of it.	labels:> I’ll wear the stuff she’s already gotten for me, because I need something to cover (just cover, not emphasize!) my butt, but no more  Yup, when i was 23 and in grad school and absolutely broke, accepting clothing items from her was sensible, because most of them would increase my total wardrobe by a good 10 %.  But now that i have a job and income? Yeahno.

text:What is your ideal first date outfit?	labels:Ahh, so fun. On my first date with my husband I wore a gray bodycon jersey skirt, a navy tee, a pendant necklace, and muted gold sandals.   If I were going on a first date today, I think I'd wear skinny jeans, a black camisole, a long sweater, and slip on black vans-esque shoes. Like [this outfit](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/fd/fa/91/fdfa9155f78ec924338cbb1f614c6d96.jpg) and [these shoes](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81KVes-Zq3L._AC_SR700,525_.jpg). It's basic but idgaf.   Colder weather, it could honestly be the same outfit but swap out some black boots and a sweater with a neck wide enough to show a little cami and a wool coat on top. It doesn't get that cold here ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
text:Horrid shoes for a first date, nice pumps would be better, or even smart lace trainers. Nice outfit. Black boots would be hot.	labels:Uhh, haha, we'll have to agree to disagree here. I think the shoes are cute, casual, but sleek.   Tennis shoes would be okay but reads too sporty to me.   Heels are a no-go. Too formal for a first date, no good if you want to do a physical activity like going for a walk or bowling or something, and most of the guys I dated back in the day were shorter than I am and I wouldn't want them to feel intimidated. They'd obviously have to be cool with my height no matter what, but I'm not going to push the issue on the first date.	episode_done:True
text:When your personality and aesthetic don't quite match?	labels:I’m going to echo what others have said - this is *his* problem, not yours. It seems like to some extent he’s expressing that he knows what your “true style” is better than you - when more likely it’s just about what he likes best. I’m going to apply the benefit of the doubt here too... but I think you need to express to him that you’re happy with how you dress.  My partner once said early on that I dressed too colorfully for the area where we live - I was pretty firm that I was happy with how I dress and it’s never come up since then. In the past few years he’s even come to encourage my habits.   It’s someone reflecting their feelings on to you - hopefully when you let them know you don’t feel the same way, they’ll understand and their point of view will change. If it doesn’t, it’s probably not a good sign.	episode_done:True

text:What did your mom teach you about fashion/style - and what did she not teach you?	labels:My mother mainly taught me the rule of quality over quantity, and matching undertone to colors, especially clothing. My mother is very stylish, and tried to teach me about makeup, but I refused. I’m pretty glad I did, because I firmly believe makeup should be for enjoyment and not “fixing” things. There’s no one way to look, and makeup/fashion should be part of that—not part of how someone fits themselves into frankly outdated and damaging notions of selfhood through conforming to marketable types of beauty.   I later discovered my own makeup style/desire as a performer, which was fun.	episode_done:True

The description of “brain dead” is about the nature of the middle class society (which is only 1/6th of the Chinese population) that has been created, which is mind blowingly consumerist and blind to the crimes of the CCP and not the individuals within it.  3. Yes, I 100% believe in Western supremacy in the terms you’re describing. Liberal democracy is better than dictatorship. If Liberal democracy was an eastern creation I would believe in Eastern supremacy by your very tight and manipulative description.  4. A lot of people die under dictatorships and war. Is my not buying some junk products created by ethnic minority slaves making “a lot of people die”? I don’t think so.  5. What you’re doing is such nonsense. You know that it’s easy to play the race card in discussions about China in order to turn the conversation against discussion about the CCP. None of us are talking about Chinese people. We want Chinese people to thrive in a free society and if I can undermine your government to make that happen I absolutely will.   Although, I must say that your comment reeks of the kind of comments we used to see from Russian trolls in advance of 2016. Is someone paying you to write this nonsense?

text:Endless and rotational monthly.  Back in 2015 they began with Palazzo Pants, much to my chagrin.  When I saw them in the store I was horrified; only the size 18+, and 40+ aged ladies wore those in the 80’s when everyone young was wearing designer jeans and I doubted I would ever buy a pair.  I have stuck with skinny leggings of various types because of a little spandex and my legs look good enough yet to wear them and they are really more comfortable than jeans around the waist.  So far in the provinces of suburbia one can see everything but I assure you the soccer moms around here did not wear mom jeans.  I now have a very jaded opinion of Who, What, Wear because each day it is just really an excuse to showcase overpriced designer items fit for big city life at prices set in the stratosphere.  I look at what is sold in the stores I shop at.  I pick what I like and what materials I think will wear well.  I am happy with that.	labels:	episode_done:True

If you mean one or two versions of literally the same outfit (like 5 identical white blouses worn with 3 versions of the exact same pair of black pants) then no...I would absolutely hate that and be bored out my mind by day 3, lol.  But then again, clothes are a form of artistic expression for me, so I would never thrive in a minimalist mindset with clothes.  However, I do tend to gravitate towards 2 or 3 main silhouettes, and the vast majority of my clothes fit into this.  In that sense, it's kind of a uniform?  Just without identical pieces.	episode_done:True

They drape/fall well, and have usable pockets. Lots of different cuts in the same fabric, increasing the chances something will fit perfectly. Most of their pants come in petite and tall also.
text:For context, I worked in animal medicine rather than human as a vet tech, and I've been out of that field for a few years now, but I did love UA butter soft (when I could afford them)! They're so comfortable and definitely more flattering than some other brands.   Also, I literally never tucked in a scrub top. The thought never once crossed my mind and I never saw anyone else do it. Is that a thing people do?? How do you use the pockets that way?  As for accessorizing, I wore a purely functional waterproof sports watch with a seconds counter. My hair was usually back in a pony. Shoes were just athletic sneakers.   Our patients, I imagine, are typically a lot messier and require a bit more physical restraint, so there wasn't much "fashion" involved.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:People who used to play super safe with fashion, how did you overcome your fear of bold choices?	labels:I'm in my mid 30s and all I want to do is dress for myself these days. When I hit the 30s and gained a little weight, I found it harder to connect to my wardrobe. It just didn't really feel like me anymore in ways I couldn't quite articulate. And then I thought to myself - what do I want to wear? Do I actually like these clothes? How do I want to feel in my clothes? What outfits will make me feel like me?   One of the things that helps me is following women over 30 on instagram who make fashion decisions I admire, especially WOC and women who wear larger sizes. I'm slowly moving towards my goal of caring less if an outfit is conventionally attractive, but rather focusing on how it makes me feel. I still pin outfits on skinny models, but then I go through my closet and try those things out and see how I feel - and then I write them down or take a picture so on a busy morning when I don't know what to wear, I remember oh yeah that outfit makes me feel really cool.   I am the size that I am - a slightly poofy French tuck isn't going to change that, and it doesn't even really change the perception of my size except for those who think - hey that's a chic outfit, nice French tuck! Some people would say that a French tuck isn't conventionally flattering on my body because I'm not skinny anymore - but I like the way it makes me feel. With the right shirt or sweater, I feel a little chic and eclectic, or a little academic, etc.   Have you checked out r/oldhagfashion? They're inspiring in general for their no-fucks-given attitude, and there's a list of bloggers/instagrammers to check out.	episode_done:True
text:Dream Unconventional/ Unrealistic Fashion Accessories- Discussion	labels:I’m Op here’s some of mine, ranked from most normal to weirdest. These are all at least partially ironic I should mention lol but feel free to joke and comment :  - Septum Chain Brooch - it’s really difficult to find a photo of what I’m talking about Ive only ever seen it in runway fashion. The closest I could find is [this one that connects to the ear instead.](https://m.aliexpress.com/item/33057876757.html?trace=wwwdetail2mobilesitedetail) essentially it just a nose ring with a chain that hangs down onto a brooch which is usually pinned on to a blazer. I would love to find one some day, however it does seem quite hazardous.  - Victorian walking stick / Parisol - I just know both would look fantastic with my wardrobe. A [parisol ](https://www.worthpoint.com/worthopedia/black-battenburg-lace-gothic-lolita-1692896768) like this would be oh so stylish and perfect for avoiding the sun and a [victorian walking cane ](http://www.catwalkyourself.com/fashion-dictionary/walking-stickcane/) such as this one would match my velvet blazer perfectly. Could also make for great self defense as historically they are weighted at the top for said reason!   - Art Dolls - so this one may need the most explanation and isn’t too serious but I feel carrying around one of these stylish beautiful art pieces in the same fashion rich teens carry chihuahuas would truly make me feel like the glam eccentric crazy artsy lady I have always dreamed of being. Truly a fun accessory. Especially if I could get its outfit to coordinate mine. I like animal ones like [This one](https://www.etsy.com/listing/712535682/stuffed-wolf-animal-art-doll-animal-wolf) but my absolute favorite dream one to own would be [This over 1,000 dollar anime one ](http://dolkus.com/mobile/detail.php?id=40202) . At that price I’d parade it around everywhere. Possibly peeking out of a purse. I have seen some fellow teens on tik tok put calico critters in overall pockets as a fun fashion statement so maybe it could work out for me. Lmao. (If anyone’s done anything similar let me know)

I started buying clothes left and right, bulking up my wardrobe which had only seen used items before.   Ive always had a kind of alternative, grunge style, and i think i still do, but now I can do it and still look cute, I feel amazing in everything I wear, I have a beautiful motorcycle jacket with all the zippers and snaps.

text:Had the same experience when I started wearing knit sweaters instead of sweatshirts a couple years ago and more recently started wearing shirts in casual settings other than going out for a drink or dinner.  I think it's a matter of people getting used to seeing something "new" to them, and making a "tryhard" association with dressing a bit smarter (wearing and OCBD was enough to elicit reactions from my friends), especially in the 18-25 year range in my experience.   I didn't give them weight: it's a matter of feeling comfortable in what you wear.  If you want to dress up because you take it as a form of self expression, then you shouldn't care about what your friends say, as you wouldn't if someone criticized your favourite band for example: personal taste is different for everybody.   If instead, as many of us, me included most of the times, you take fashion as a way to make yourself look "nicer", and are genuinely happy/hyped to be wearing what you are then remember that THAT is what people from the outside will see the most, even before your eye-catching last jawn!  I am now the one my friend ask suggestion about clothes to, and as seen in my pics it's not like I am some kind of fashion inspiration or know anything special! Take a look at [this article](https://streetxsprezza.wordpress.com/2020/09/20/old-ethan-my-style-evolution-and-the-journey-to-being-myself/) /u/theteenagegentleman posted a couple months ago about his fashion journey, it definitely is something I found inspiring and helped me come to terms with the fact that your style is your own and you shouldn't feel forced to wear what is "common" in your group if you like something more. Hope this wall-of-text was somewhat helpful! Good luck out there!	labels:Took a screenshot of this and gonna refer back to it when feeling conscious, it’s really well said.	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 16, 2021	labels:What are your thoughts on dress shoes that are spit-shined? As in, the type where you see your reflection in 'em  I usually just polish dress shoes with a single layer of wax or two so it's protected from scuffs. But aiming for a mirror look seems like an interesting skill
text:Mirror polish is tricky; takes some time to achieve and you’ll have to maintain it, which at some point after adding more wax just means stripping it all down and reapplying it layer by layer. Some people consider it a meditative/calming ritual, others think it’s a pain.   My take on it — it’s a nice detail, but might look a little out of place on derbies or loafers. I could see it on a dark brown Oxford, and definitely on a black captoe Oxford or wholecut, especially as an opera pump replacement (bc let’s be real, patent leather is gross; it’s literally a layer of plastic on top of leather)  Just a question of if you want to do it or not.	labels:https://imgur.com/a/D8B3lg7  I just did it on some Oxfords I had.

text:This comment is surprisingly based:  >While I agree that the patches on the bomber jacket, or the Naval rank insignia are extremely bad taste, I don't see an issue with military inspired clothing. Bomber jackets, peacoats, cap toe Lace-up boots all used to be strictly military items and are now pretty normal to see people wearing around. You'd be hard pressed to find a store that doesn't sell at least one of these items. Even the most basic of basics like chino pants, t shirts, and suits have military roots. These RL designs suck, but there's plenty of tasteful military clothing out there that civilians wear because it's functional, or stylish, or is no longer strictly military clothing, and there's nothing wrong with that.  And then Mr. Silva comes in with his take on it (unsurprisingly he's a literal boomer):  >It actually wouldn't be an issue if the people pushing this weren't the same people who despise the military and all who are connected with it. In the late 60s and early 70s, I put up with these people and only hit one of them (the only one who came close enough) and don't want them profiting off our gear.

text:Just singing the praises of wool	labels:Fashion in general. I alternately wore the same two pairs of sweatpants throughout middle school, even when I had to run the mile...in the summer :') I only got compliments on my clothing when I wore my sister's hand-me-downs (which are Korean style and iykyk). I'm much  more into finding my own aesthetic now but I'm still googling things like "best styles for tall girls" and "how to shop effectively at thrift stores" cuz I'm not used to the whole fashion thing yet.   So uh, any advice on best styles for tall, slender college-age girls? :)
text:I’m 5’8 and 120lbs. The majority of all of my clothes are thrifted.   The trick with thrifting it browse often. At my pique, prior to covid, I go to the thrift store multiple times a week. The trick is to have an idea of what type of items you’re looking for, but without being too specific. But you don’t want to go into the store without a plan either.   For example, I know I need more clothes for layering in the winter. So I might go to the thrift store and browse long sleeved shirts, looking for shirts in colors that match my wardrobe and that seem like they’d easily wear under other clothes.   For more specific items I need, thrifting is t usually the best option. However, because I thrift frequently, I have a tendency to see things that I know I’ll want in a few months (eg in college I knew I’d need a dress for an event in the next semester, so I’d keep my eyes open for dresses for several months prior to the time when I need the dress.   Learning very very basic tricks to alter clothes has also helped tremendously. I’ve actually begun sewing now and purchased a machine, but for a long time I’ve been working on a few easy alterations that really don’t require knowledge or skill in sewing.   For example, I have added strips of elastic inside the waist band of almost all of the jeans I own. As a tall skinny girl, the waist in jeans is frequently too large. I know waist fit is an issue for most women regardless of height. I cut a slit on the inside of the waist band that doesn’t go all the way through to the outside of the pant, then I slip the strip of elastic inside the layers of the waist band, stitch one end in place, then use a safety pin through the other end of the elastic to pull the strip of elastic through the layers of the waist band, pulling it tight and stitching the other end in place so that the elastic gathers the waist band in the back, making my pants fit more comfortably at the waist without making them tight. Takes about 5 minutes once you get the hang of it.	labels:thank you!	episode_done:True

text:Not sure if you are new to the cold.  If you are you might want to try silk long underwear.  I wear them under all pants.  They fit without bulk and the silk slides with the body.

I don't want to keep holding onto clothes just because I got that while on a trip with a friend that I enjoy. You can also do a cost per wear analysis to help you visualize the value of clothing or think about what the value is of a shirt that's not being worn, or shoes that aren't being worn.

text:FAQ: What are the different use cases of boat shoes, moccasins, driving shoes, and loafers?	labels:For me, the simplest distintiction would look at it in terms of the casual vs. formal.  Obvious with the name, boat shoes and driving shoes were originally designed for people who wanted stability/comfort when operating a boat or vehicle. But nowadays, boat shoes, moccasins, driving shoes are all meant for casual outfits when you don't want to wear sneakers. They can be worn with tees and jeans, casual button downs, chinos etc for just a regular night out or weekend errands.  Loafers on the other hand, have a large variety (ie. penny loafers, horsebit loafers, chunky lug sole loafers that are trendy right now, unlined Belgian loafers, etc) that they can go from casual to formal. I would even argue that velvet slippers that people match with tuxedos would fall into the loafers category too. The popular look this summer had been pairing Weejun loafers with Patagonia baggies for a more casual look but the loafers on the higher-end price points (Gucci loafers, John Lobb, Baudoin and Lange, etc) can easily be paired with suits and tuxedos.
text:[deleted]	labels:Why is it that the "rule" for boat shoes is no socks but the very similar camp mocs are to be worn with socks? Particularly the thickest socks you can find. The only differences I can tell between the two styles are the number of eyelets and slightly different soles. I wear socks with my boat shoes regularly and think it looks fine.	episode_done:True

I responded reasonably by taking things way too far and felt wounded and violated for weeks after the sweater comment incident. I resolved thereafter to hate all fashion, jewelry, and beauty.

So far, I've found these brands that fit me:  * Jeans: Express Jeans * Tops: Express Jeans, some others * Jackets: Express Jeans, UNIQLO, J. Crew * Slacks: Express Jeans, UNIQLO * Jeans: Nudie Jeans, Abercrombie and Fitch  Even Express Jeans is hit and miss. Their 29x34 slacks fit me, but I have to wear a belt to hold up their 29x34 jeans (and they don't make 28x34 jeans). Some of their XS T-shirts fit me, but many have arm holes so large, I can't comfortably raise my arms. Abercrombie and Fitch jeans fit me initially, but after a few washes, the length shrinks. Nudie Jeans are expensive and UNIQLO jeans are too short, if I recall correctly.  I've found some clothes in the women's section, but most either don't fit right or look too feminine. The best fitting jeans I've ever purchased were actually a juniors size--but I didn't care for the embroidery on the butt.  I've generated the 3D model from my measurements, for what it's worth:  [https://preview.redd.it/cv0of99jj3i61.png?width=654&format=png&auto=webp&s=8bf9a897b5fe3edd6ffe7f2b5dcb9aa75bd9d700](https://preview.redd.it/cv0of99jj3i61.png?width=654&format=png&auto=webp&s=8bf9a897b5fe3edd6ffe7f2b5dcb9aa75bd9d700)  I see others guys who are roughly my shape--but they often seem to resign themselves to looking pitiful in baggy clothes rather than trying to find something that fits.  If you're a similar shape, where have you found clothes (at a reasonable price) in the U.S. (or online) that fit? Also, have you found any brands that offer men's jeans designed for a W/H ratio of < 0.90?  Please don't tell me to hit the gym or eat more pies. I'm looking for clothes that fit me, not the other way around. My body type wasn't all that uncommon 70 years ago in the U.S.  I mistakenly posted this in the main reddit and was instructed to move it here. User u/J0zey posted a good response that I'll paraphrase:  >A 32" inseam might actually be OK. You may not want the jeans to bunch at all at the ankles. Some brands are: DUER, Vuori, Lulelmon, Western Rise, North Face, Everlane
text:>My body type wasn't all that uncommon 70 years ago in the U.S.  But it is now. You'll have to have your clothes altered if it's that hard to find clothes off the rack.

text:Inspo Album: Back to School - a Dark(ish) Academia Inspired Style Album	labels:Welp, I've been dressing in a mix of minimalistic, structured and vintage clothes for a few years and almost looks like this with a few twists.   Thanks for the tag, I didn't knew how to search for this kind of aesthetic.  To add to the discussion, I've felt like something was missing in my wardrobe rotation and plan to add a few things to my collection in the next months.   My vintage pieces tend to be really bold compared to the rest of my clothes. Strong patterns, 30s & 40s blouses, full circle skirts etc. I don't want to dress in a full 40s style because I feel kind of costumey.  I struggled to wear them in a coherent way and I found a rule that pretty much works all the time: I only wear a vintage or vintage looking piece at at time. The rest is pretty clean and modern in style. My hair is long wavy curly and strawberry and my face round and vintage looking??? Idk, sometimes I think just my hair and makeup makes the outfit vintage-y enough.  I have a bunch of turtleneck fitted sweaters in every jewel colour and that's my go to option tucked in high waisted anything bottom.  The season I struggle the most with is summer just because I live in a permanent 35C weather in summer. I've recently bought some simple blouses with short bell sleeves and that seemed to make the trick with some skirts. I'm still searching for the perfect knee length pleated shorts to wear to work and anywhere else.  This thread made me curious about tweed since I don't have any. And some blazers I don't feel stupid or overdressed in.	episode_done:True

I've spent so much money on them and have bought cropped jackets, shirts, tube tops, etc, to match.  However I don't like wearing them anymore because they squeeze my fucking organs. I literally get stomach pain/cramps and am miserable.  But I continue wearing them when I have to go somewhere that I know I'll be at for a short amount of time (i.e. grocery store). I wear them out of guilt and don't want to think I threw my money away.

text:General Discussion - December 23, 2020	labels:How do you all keep trying new things fashion-wise without expanding your wardrobe? I'm on a clothes-spending freeze for a little while and I'm finding it a bit hard to put together new, different outfits out of what I have.   I don't think it's for a lack of pieces, because I feel like I have a lot of variety there. I just feel like I've been lacking some inspiration lately and was curious how you all get over that block?
text:I try to "shop my closet" if that makes sense.

text:How would you describe the quality of self-knit/self-made clothes vs. store bought?	labels:[deleted]
text:IMO it’s surprising how well fast fashion is sewn- stuff like top stitching etc is often better than I can do. Also they are more likely to have exactly the right machines such as cover stitch to get the correct finish.   But yes, fabric is the major one. At the moment I’m making a linen dress with pockets and sleeves (Grainline farrow for the sewists :)) its a gorgeous good quality emerald linen. The fabric and thread cost about $60 Australian. The closest equivalent ready to wear would be $200+ AUD.   Each to their own but I do find it frustrating when people put in the effort to sew then use some awful cheap fabric that pills or loses its shape after a few washes.	labels:I find its the cut and the fabrics that let me down with fast fashion - over the last few years i have rarely found anything that hasn't been sewn properly. I think the last thing was a small section of unravelling hem stitch on a t-shirt? I bought that one in 2015.	episode_done:True
text:Favourite places to get your fall wool fix?	labels:Don’t forget to check out thrift stores. This is where I stock up on cashmere sweaters for a few dollars a piece, wool skirts, kilts, sweaters, vests, and cardigans, and amazing wool blazers and coats. I’ve found mint condition mohair and camel hair 3/4 coats for as low as $10, black cashmere sweaters for $2-3 and up, and cable knit pullovers for as low as $4. It’s amazing what people get rid of, not realizing how expensive it all is new. I also loooove wool in the fall and winter, and so this has been a super affordable way to build a dream cold-weather wardrobe.   The only thing wool I buy new are socks for the most part, everything else I’ve found at estate sales, garage sales, and thrift shops. When/if you go, definitely go through the boys and men’s departments, too. A bit of tailoring can make anything look custom like some of the pieces on Walker Slater maybe.

Wide in the legs and seat, but do no require a belt to stay up because of the waist cinch tabs.  They aren't the most flattering trousers i own, but they look professional enough.  Home life i take my work trousers that are too beat up for work anymore and cut them into either crop pants or shorts, and get another several years' out of them.  Those are my everyday social trousers, though i still have a 1 pair of cargo shorts i bought almost a decade ago now, that started their lives as shorts.    I haven't owned jeans in at least 10 years.  They just aren't compatible with my style, and black jeans fade so much more quickly than BDUs, i had to re-dye them multiple times a year.    If i have a more formal occasion, i have 1 pair of black dress trousers, and 1 black kilt, and i alternate between them depending on my mood and the formality of the occasion.

I've had *strangers* ask me if I was ok because they assumed someone who resembled a corpse that much must be actually nearing death.   I love heels and very sleek business casual as well as what I can only call ho-fits. I have bad ankles fr from working on concrete floors too many hours, and take public transportation. It's too much of a risk I could sprain my ankle from how much I walk, and I can't afford another sprain. My office is not business casual or sleek, but a no fuss "just don't wear t-shirts with slogans or anything" type of place. I am decidedly over my ho phase, despite my continued love of the clothes.   My fantasy of wearing heeled booties with a structured fashion blazer over a mauve dress is not any less real just because I have the common sense to not go through with it.

text:Can you have a clothing style without actually wearing that certain style much?	labels:This isn’t a direct answer to your question, but I’ve found I have a ‘hopeful’ sense of style and a ‘realistic’ sense of style.  Hopeful-me will think about buying a teal floral wrap dress because it’s gorgeous. Realistic-me knows it will sit in my closet untouched for 3 years because I don’t wear teal!   I’ve learned to differentiate between the two while I shop, at least. If I was a celebrity suddenly, maybe I would lean towards hopeful-me’s style, but for now I am normal and realistic!
text:Yes this! I call it “ideal style” and “real style”. My “ideal style” involves a lot of flowy, Christy Dawn-style dresses. My actual, “real style” is way more simple - in my free time I wear a lot of plain t-shirts, sweaters, and jeans/shorts. I’ve bought a couple of absolutely lovely dresses over the years that I never wear, but will reach for my favorite Everlane t-shirts and comfy sweaters over and over again.	labels:I call it clothes for my fantasy life, Think shoes I can't walk in or stand in for too long.

And I don’t care about what you say you are. Fedoras/Dusters/Capes/whatever is not just clothing. It’s an entire lifestyle and subculture that you are unlikely to be privy to or even fit into if you lack the euphoria and pedigree. That’s just the reality.  You’re probably one of those people who believes anybody can be anything yada yada yada. Sorry to break it to you, but no matter how much I want to be, say, a gentlesir, it simply isn’t going to happen. I can don the wolf shirts all I want, but it doesn’t change the fact that because it isn’t who I was born, it’s something I’ll never be. The same goes for most of the people on this subreddit who, by most accounts, even detest and reject the trappings of class that can not be divorced from euphoria. It is a style of, by, and for the American lower basement class and below, and nothing you say will change that.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 06, 2021	labels:So I'm an idiot, I bought my 1st suit final sale from Suit Supply without knowing much about suits. The sleeves are way too short, measure 5cm with my arms at the sides. I contacted Suit Supply and was told the most a tailor can extend the length of the sleeve is 1.5cm due to the functional sleeves. So 5cm - 1.5cm = 3.5cm. I googled and according to the site Gentlemansgazette: "Many menswear guides claim that the proper amount of cuff to show falls between between 1/2″ (1.25 cm) to 1″ (2.5cm). Most guides, us included, agree that anything more than 1.25″ (4cm) is too much cuff to show; it makes the junction of your two sleeves look like you haven’t considered how they will go together." At 3.5cm it makes the cut if I get this to a tailor but I'm not sure if I'm just fooling myself into thinking this will work and should just try and sell it and cut my loses. Here's what the suit looks like on me: [https://imgur.com/a/vyME2Bw](https://imgur.com/a/vyME2Bw)
text:The suit fits you fine through the chest and body, but the sleeves and body are both too short. You can lengthen the sleeves to a semi-acceptable length, but the actual jacket cannot be lengthened, and it’s too short on you.   Cut your losses, sell the suit, and get the L (long) version next time. You’re lucky that SuitSupply holds its value quite well, especially new. You will be able to sell it for close to what you paid for it, possibly more. Start on Grailed, Styleforum, and eBay.	labels:ok thx so much. I bought this suit for $268.24 Canadian and retails for $530 Canadian. It's a size 40 regular, navy pure wool that's textured, what price should I list it at? And where does Poshmark fit into the Grailed, Styleforum and ebay order? Also in terms of length of the body I'm only 5'11.5 and Suit Supply said I need to be over 6'1 to be tall so I'm wondering if just the Lazio suits have a shorter length? Unfortunately all I did was take chest/body measurements when buying this.	episode_done:True
text:What's the greatest length you've gone to obtain a much coveted fashion item?	labels:When I was in middle school, I saw a sweater on a fashionable outfits Twitter page. I reverse googled the image to find it came from a shop in the UK (I’m in the US). Forgot about conversion and I ended up paying over $60 just for the sweater, not including shipping. My parents were so angry I spent all the money I had on one single clothing item but I still have the sweater about 10 years later and it continues to be a staple item

text:Changing your mindset from fast fashion to one of investment pieces. What did you learn?	labels:Basic classic pieces never go out of style: i.e., black cocktail dress, blazer, good denim shorts/jeans/jacket, pencil skirt, black pumps, you get the drill. Those pieces are always worth spending extra on. The mix and match pieces can be more of the economical, trendy purchases.  Budget is important. Don't buy what you don't need unless it's screaming at you. Actually, never buy any piece of clothing unless it screams at you. Lol that's my rule of thumb.  A great wardrobe has stuff from department stores/fancy pieces, forever 21/zara (or the like) and thrifted pieces. Buy cotton when you can - it breathes better and lasts longer than most synthetic fabrics.  Also! you probably have a lot more good outfits than you think you do. Sometimes you just need to boost your creativity, mix old pieces with new pieces, get a little adventures and above all else, be confident! confidence is more important than what you're wearing - it's the sparkle factor.	episode_done:True

text:What rules do you break for your body type?	labels:I think a lot of these rules come from old fashion norms that are meant to make people look as thin as possible so I hope they become a thing of the past!

I think the example picture was Jessica Simpson and I thought she looked gorgeous in that outfit.  I also love mixing black and navy.
text:I don't understand the turtleneck one. I tend to think they look better on people with larger breasts because they break up the block of color a bit. I am not well endowed, and I think turtlenecks just make everything look flatter. Like now my torso is a large expanse of nothing.	labels:I think the "rule" is for people with large and maybe kind of saggy boobs? Cuz big boobs can look like they hang SOOOO LOOOOOWWW in a turtleneck. Source: I used to HATE turtlenecks on my 34D boobs until I bought one hell of a pushup bra.

text:Low cuts usually end near the ankle, no show is exactly how it sounds - they're designed not to show at all.   No show socks are for people who dont want their socks to be visible when they are wearing shoes. They're usually used for warm weather shoes where it can be acceptable to go sockless, such as loafers, boat shoes, and sneakers/trainers.  Low cut socks are for when you don't mind a bit of sock, or you're wearing higher ankles shoes (i.e. hightop converse) where no-shows are not needed.   I personally enjoy my light cushioned Icebreaker socks during the summer. I also have some basic Puma ankle socks that work well on a budget.

text:I also think a fabric construction post would be a great add-on to this. Could make for an interesting series that takes you all the way from raw material to finished clothing item--I guess technically yarn construction should come before fabric, but maybe that's getting too deep into the nitty gritty.  Just spitballing...  **Wovens:**  - [Plainweave](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/12/7a/28/127a283bcfb6ca8c289a1a8d2a78d633.jpg): the simplest weave, a grid construction. Very rigid (low drape), stable, and cheap to do. Dull, flat appearance. Tendency toward sheerness unless densely woven, depending on thread size/spacing. **Commonly made with**: All, but especially cotton (e.g. chambray, gingham, poplin/tabbinet, duck/canvas, muslin, quilting cottons), linen (the majority of linen is plainweave, and has that characteristic slubby, thick-thin look), wool (e.g. houndstooth, [Chanel-esque](https://www.lunss.com/uploads/product/4/Y/4Y005/cute-simple-A-line-tweed-fabric-flower-girl-dress-4.jpg) in boucle yarns), silk (dupioni/shantung, silk crepe (de chine), georgette, taffeta, organza, geogette and chiffon), raw silk (noil) - [Twill](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/d5/f8/f8/d5f8f8b12a5639b8f518d32351ab5eea.jpg): Involves staggered floats of thread that create a slanted pattern. Smoother hand and look than plainweave, can sometimes be shiny.

text:What is your "White Whale" fashion product that apparently doesn't exist?	labels:For me it's a pair of leggings that have a faux leather panel down the side of the legs like a wider tuxedo stripe. I managed to get a pair a few years ago but the faux leathers starting to tear and I need to replace them. It seems like it's out of style because all I can find now are full vinyl leggings.  Also anything with pockets that can actually hold a modern smartphone without it falling out every step.
text:They’re slim pants rather than leggings, but I thought of these! I thought it was insane to pay that much for clothing but on my goodness. Drunk impulse buy that I do not regret. I’m never buying another brand of pants or leggings again. Amazing quality and good weight to them so they don’t wrinkle and they smooth and wear well. They don’t constrict like you might think of with Spanx. Just a comfortable hold.  https://www.spanx.com/the-perfect-black-pant-ankle-tuxedo-slim-straight	labels:These are really nice, I didn't know spanx had pants!	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else have this style issue?	labels:I struggle with this as well, but I have sometimes succeeded in making a style work that didn't come naturally to me. The things that help me the most are:  1) Really studying the references I like. Where is the silhouette loose? Where is it tight? At what point on a limb are the seams tailored to fall? What are the other key styling details I need to recreate? With proper tailoring, I think you can recreate a lot of looks (think of how much contouring your makeup can change your face; it's easy to create illusions on your body even if your body proportions don't cater to the typical silhouette of the lewk)  2) Take photos of your attempts and study those. Having a reference photo of what you tried and then studying it in a similar way can really help you hone in on what's working and what's not. I especially recommend looking back on the photo over the course of a couple days. Seeing a photo of my own styling after some time has passed since I created the look helps me see what is and isn't working more objectively.  3) Experiment, experiment, experiment. This was easier when there wasn't a pandemic and you could go try lots of things on, but it can still be doable. And it often takes a LOT of experimentation, but it can be really fun if you're motivated to expand your style. May not be worth it for everyone though! I think it takes a hobbyist's amount of effort.   Of course, sometimes it may just be that you appreciate a style more on others than on yourself (I will never feel like myself in a bohemian look), or you don't appreciate it enough on yourself to invest the time it would take to nail the execution (which is totally fine!)

Otherwise, I'd prefer a darker shade or even a darker color; the laces aren't exactly exciting either.   Any possible brands or recommendations? I dunno how to explain it, but I'm looking for a very "matte" design and color. Something on the darker side as well, color-wise.

It's an oxymoron to me, like have you got your legs out to stay cool or have you got the denim on to stay warm? What's going on here?
text:I wear them almost exclusively in the summer. Cut off jorts and bands shirts. I just think shorts made from other material just aren’t my style or something... when I wear them they just look like I’m trying to look “preppy” or something. I wear chinos to work.

text:What rules do you break for your body type?	labels:I think a lot of these rules come from old fashion norms that are meant to make people look as thin as possible so I hope they become a thing of the past! I remember once seeing in a magazine not to wear turtlenecks or high waisted pants if you have big boobs and that's basically all I wear. I think the example picture was Jessica Simpson and I thought she looked gorgeous in that outfit.  I also love mixing black and navy.
text:This is so true, they were all about what made you look the slimmest! But honestly, no one is going to think I’m thin regardless of what I wear. I also just think it’s so silly - fashion should be about making a statement about who you are, instead of only  showing how thin you can make yourself look. I think it’s fine if people do care more about what is flattering, but they certainly shouldn’t feel pressured to do so. I’m done with it!	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Matching shoes & purse	labels:I don’t think fashion has any rules anymore unless you’re royalty or it’s cultural.   I personally don’t like matchy matchy bag and shoes unless I’m going for a monochrome look. I tend to match tones rather than colours. I like a patterned bag (say Gucci dionysus or Fendi zucca or LV canvas) as opposed to patterned clothes because I find they blend in well with a variety of outfit choices.   If I do colour, I will make sure the tone matches. I can’t stand mixing warm times with cool tones. Eg I have a cool tone lilac paid of heels that I love wearing with my cool tone magenta bag.   You can also do opposite sides of the colour wheel with shoes and bags like a green bag and a purple/magenta pair of shoes. But again keep to the same tones. The key with fashion is the tone of colours, and that includes neutral colours too. I would always suggest everyone does a colour/tone analysis and then stick to buying items in that range. It makes mixing and matching easier.

text:Shitpost Saturday: Fashion is dead. This is now a house plant subreddit.	labels:My spiderplant is the MLM of houseplants. It keeps growing. I have 5 generations in various pots. I nurture the little babies in recycled go-go coffee cups and old candle jars. Whenever someone does me a favor, wants a plant, buys a house and needs a housewarming gift - boom, spider plant. Don't want one? Too bad, here's a spider plant.  I also have a schefflera, which I think some of them are called umbrella plants. The little tag says it can grow up to 6 feet so I have taken it to be my personal challenge to grow this sucker as much as I can.  The other ones I have are an unscientific result of trial and error. I buy random little 2-4" inch potted plants and do my best to take care of them. If they grow, I keep doing whatever I've been doing and assume they're fine, lol. If they don't grow, I change tactics and try to bring it back, but if it doesn't make it, welp, wasn't meant to be.  I've tried at 3 least times and I can't keep African violets alive.  My biggest plant caveat is that I will not bring in anything poisonous to my cats. I do enough googling in a store to determine if I feel safe maintaining it at home. Anything like lilies, for example, are an absolute no-go because even a small amount of their pollen and dust can be dangerous to them.
text:Honestly, my African violet seems to thrive on benign neglect. I water it maybe once a month and it’s out there blooming and shit.	labels:This is the way to do it. And when you water them, don't get the water on the leaves!	episode_done:True
text:Brands that are actually great that you discovered on Instagram?	labels:Ruggable!  Amazing customer service and cool product.  Edit: (I was fast scrolling and didn’t realize this was in Female fashion advice.  I’m not advising you wear a rug.  I’m such a dork!)
text:I actually hate my Ruggable. I love the design, but it is horrible for a house with dogs that shed a lot. The only way I’ve found to get hair out of the rug is to get down and scrape it with my hands. Since using the vacuum with the brush (which would normally loosen hair) separates it from the Velcro and causes it to wrinkle, it’s impossible. Also, the edges are always rolling up.   Ok, end rant!	labels:Try a designated floor hair brush	episode_done:True

text:How would you style or rebuild your wardrobe around your holy grail fashion piece?	labels:Pear shape with a big arse - I want Lauren Bacall style wool trousers. Fluid, full, and fitting just so on the waist. Styled classic for work with an equally full and fluid washed silk shirt, rolled up sleeves and tucked in with a patent waist belt. For brunch dates with a bateau neck tee that fits like a second skin, and for evenings with a low backed long sleeved version of the same. A chunky, cropped length fisherman’s jumper if theres a chill on casual strolls
text:Are you me?	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What are your go-to basic fall tops? I’m talking long sleeve tees, sweatshirts, turtlenecks etc!	labels:One of my staples is the 100% merino wool ribbed turtlenecks from Uniqlo. I have it in 3 colors (black, grey, and camel) and I wear them at least once or twice a week. They are thin enough to wear alone during autumn and also thin enough to layer under other blazers or sweaters to withstand the cold of Canadian winters

To those who have owned BS and OC gats, which one is higher quality? Also, do any of them rival the quality of Margiela GATs?
text:As with what others have said, Oliver Cabell has a bad reputation for shitty QC and bad customer service.   Apart from the other options that others have mentioned, I know that Novesta makes a decent pair too, at a fraction of the cost of the Margielas.	labels:Thanks!

text:Oh that’s amazing.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What fashion trend/s have you been obsessed with lately?	labels:I'm still going strong on the y2k meets 90s minimalism trend. Colors: black, gray, white, blue, occasional lime green and orange  * Leather! Second hand ofc * Double breasted blazers (and matching pants) * Chunky y2k-ish platform boots a la Ganni, Balenciaga, Prada * Midi pencil skirts * Long wool coats * Shoulder or carry by hand bags * Cool layering, like bustiers over shirts * Silk button ups
text:Why is it called y2k	labels:Like late 90’s 2000 style. It’s called Y2K, like Year 2 thousand (k is thousand). It was a shorthand for the year all the disaster that would unfold when the computers melted down lol a lot was “futuristic” inspired with metallics, sparkles, structure and mini-sized things.	episode_done:True
text:What to do when nothing fits you properly?	labels:I have a similar issue and I’ve resorted to getting everything tailored to fit me. It feels good having clothes fit perfectly but the extra cost sucks	episode_done:True
text:What did people *actually* wear in 2000's?	labels:I was in middle and high school in South Carolina. We wore flare jeans that drug on the ground and gave us all muffin tops, t shirts from your flavor of mall store (Abercrombie for the preps and Hot topic for the goths) oversized skateshoes, rainbow flip flops or potato shoes(the clog form of birkenstocks) and the same damn hoodie every day. If you were a student you had a jansport book bag and if you were a girl you had a purse, either a Dooney and Bourke(sp?) Coach, Vera Bradley, or a "Louis Vuitton" speedy bought for $20 at a flea market
text:Never heard them called potato shoes before, but it's so accurate!	labels:Oh lord, I bought a pair last year for slip on dog walk shoes. They really go look like foot potatoes. I can’t bring myself to wear them out of the neighborhood, but they it next to the door for trips to the mailbox or car. So comfy, so ugly.	episode_done:True

text:Is fast fashion really fast fashion if you get years of use out of the garments?	labels:> So where does that leave the consumer who has a closet full of items purchased at fast fashion retailers, but rarely makes new purchases and many of their current pieces have remained in their closet for years?   If you already have a closet full of fast fashion, taking good care of it and using it for as long as possible is the most ethical choice.  I'm in the same boat.  I'm doing a year of no new clothes/shoes purchases (only thrifted/poshmark) and I'm trying to only get things that are high quality and will last, even if they are used.    Most of these online clothing boutiques (at least the ones I see on Poshmark/Facebook/Instagram are not sourcing ethically produced items.  I'm sure there are some that are, but they all seem to have the same stuff and you can tell just from the photos that it's cheaply made.  Again, I haven't seen every online boutique there is so I'm sure there are some out there that are fine.	episode_done:True
text:How do your clothes wear out?	labels:- jeans stretch and get droopy butt - shirts and knits get pilling in the fabric - clothes get random holes in them from the dryer or something - sweat stains  The sweat stains are the most annoying. I don’t really wear jeans anymore. But I sweat a lot as a person. I try to wear undershirts to protect my nicer work clothes but that doesn’t really work in the summer when it’s too hot for layers
text:ugh the random holes is starting to get me too. they’re not even on the seams, just random spots!!! i hate it	labels:For clothes I really like I put them in garment bags for the wash and then air dry them. No clue if it’s the washer or the dryer doing it but I figure if I can avoid at least one of them them maybe it will help prevent the holes. No idea if it works though.	episode_done:True
text:Best 2020 pajamas?!	labels:I honestly prefer night gowns. Does that make me weird? I swear I’m not 80. I just can’t stand bottoms twisting as I toss and turn. Anyways, I have the hardest time finding nightgowns that aren’t made for the elderly or aren’t lace nighties. I just want a cute and soft night gown! Until then I’m also in the oversized T-shirt camp.

text:What are your most loved ride-or-die winter clothing items?	labels:Uniqlo heattech turtlenecks!	episode_done:True
text:What I Like is Not What I choose to wear	labels:There are many reasons that this could be happening. One could be that you might have self image issues and think that these looks don't eork eith your body type. It could be that you just have the preconceived ide of the type of person who wears these clothes and you don't see yourself that way. It could be that you just aren't used to wearing these types of clothes so it feels/looks weird to you. I used to only wear sandals and flip-flops and I hated closed shoes, but now I wear nothing but closed shoes and sandals make me feel weird. It could just take some getting used to and a change of self perception.
text:Same thing with me. I live in FL. So year round was flip flops. I’ve been wearing actual shoes for years now, and I feel so weird wearing flip flops out of the house.	labels:Hey, I'm in Florida too! My biggest gripe with the heat is that I love layers and fuzzy soft sweaters, and I can't wear much of anything other than tank tops and shorts for most of the year :(	episode_done:True
text:How do you actually incorporate colour in your wardrobe?	labels:I hopped on r/coloranalysis and got an idea of my palette. I’ve been able to add a few sweaters/tops into my rotation that I feel confident look good against my skin tone. It has definitely helped me dip my toes into wearing more color and feeling confident doing so! Before I had an idea of what colors actually worked, I felt uncomfortable buying/wearing color.  I didn’t really think adding an accessory in a color helped me feel more comfortable. Understanding color theory a little more wrt how it works on my own coloring felt more intentional in my opinion, then I just went for adding a few tops.	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 28, 2020	labels:How should a jumpsuit / coveralls fit?  I am planning on buying a jumpsuit. My chest is wider than my waist but every jumpsuit I find has these issues. My waist is 30-31 inches and my chest is 40-41 inches. I am constantly bodybuilding so I will pack on more muscle:  * a medium sized jumpsuit will be exactly at 40 inches for chest and 32 inches for waist. The waist will fit perfectly but the chest will not give me much room to move.  * a large sized jumpsuit will be at 42 inch chest size and a 36 waist size. The waist will be too loose but the chest will be just right.  How should j go about buying my jumpsuit?
text:You’ll just have to come to terms with being an outlier. Very few people have a 10” drop like you. Nobody is making jumpsuits for your body type because they’d only sell three per year.    Just get one that fits in the shoulders and take it to a tailor.  Hopefully they can bring in the waist in a way that works for you.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:what are wardrobe items you own that you absolutely recommend to everyone else here?	labels:IMO- everyone should have a down jacket. They are incredible in the cold. So much better than any of the synthetic weather proof options.

I'm far from vegan but some down harvesting is extremely cruel, and I'd rather not support those practices.	labels:Some brands are certified by [RDS (responsible down standard)](https://textileexchange.org/standards/responsible-down/), Columbia, north face, abercrombie off the top of my head	episode_done:True
text:What inspired your passion/love for fashion?	labels:I remember first time I was about 5 dad worked abroad and took home some huge clothing store catalogs for us to see and I spent every day “picking clothes” and it was so mesmerizing and relaxing and it turned on my fashion sense I started drawing clothes for my paper dolls, recently in parents attic even found “Perry’s first clothing catalog” I have made around the same age. Oh I loved loved loved fashion but we were kinda poor and we dressed what we found for cheap in local market.   When I was a teen I went to emo/scene stage and even tho where I lived haven’t got any clothes for me in early 2000’s, so I got to improvise, sometimes my mom helped me but she used to say “when you move to Capital city you’ll be able go wear anything you want, where we are people won’t get you”. And it made me dream that in years I will move to big city and wear all the things I wanted, still being the strange teen with ridiculous makeup and dark curated clothes I could find in our very small city (talking about 8k people living there).   When I got to choose what to study I, until the last moment couldn’t decide I wanted to study fashion and clothing design or graphic design, swapping both names to a first place until the last moment applications closed (where I live system is that you get to fill a list for your preffered studies and first place you pick is the one you want to go to the most, but if your grade is too low for first position, they check the second and so on and so on till the list ends) and the last moment I went to graphic design still dreaming I will work with clothes one day.  Fast forward to when I moved after scool to study. I moved to second biggest city in my country still loving the fashion but in a preppy, more casual way since I was still too broke but my stuff had to fit and got look great together with my other limited stuff.   However after studies, even tho I found a job that paid well my mental health went down and I stopped even caring how I looked, jeans and old cardigan was it for most of the days. When I hit rock bottom of my mental state and started seeking help I looked for ways to gain back some of my life and one of them was fashion. I finally stopped caring how everyone looks at me and embraced me. I have a friend I love dearly and she wears stuff I always wanted to wear and she is still my inspiration when it comes to fashion, and now, about a year later I loooooove how I look, even tho I am “too pale”, “wearing too much black”, “my platforms looks not ladylike” but I am so happy with how I look and I love looking for some inspiration around the web.   Thank you for this thread, it was really nice to remember when it first came to my life!	episode_done:True

text:Thoughts on jumpsuits?	labels:They're difficult for those of us who are different sizes on top and bottom (even more so than dresses, IMO).
text:Yeah totally agree. Recently I got one from a friend's closet cleanout that actually flatters my body, and I think it's because it's very flowy and loose so the size difference isn't an issue. Regardless I would never buy one without trying it on first because that's literally the only jumpsuit I've ever tried on that didn't awkwardly ride up my crotch and make me look like a toddler...	labels:I’m smaller on top and my favorite thing in the world right now are drop crotch jumpsuits, totally solves that problem.

And the coats they DID have weren't temperature rated so I had no idea if they were sufficient. So I bought nothing...  Signed,  Girl from FL/SC	labels:Oh god do NOT go to a fashion store for weather wear.  Shop at Dick's Sporting Goods.  Or REI.  Cabela's.  Gander Mountain.  You feel me?  Go to a sportswear store and get you a good Colombia coat.  Get a layered coat that is rated for at least 40 below.  And don't get it too tight because you need room for layers underneath it like sweatshirts, big sweaters, etc.  It's not gonna be the cutest but it'll keep you warm.  And shop NOW or they will be gone by Halloween.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else use a “formula” to create their outfits?	labels:I used to follow a lot of formulas and guidelines, but as I documented my outfits (and started seeing other people document theirs), I found that [listening to my lizard overlord](https://www.instagram.com/p/CIlhWoCFiWx/) made me a lot happier. Here are some things my lizard overlord likes for now. I'm sure this will change:  * Comfort first - nothing itchy, restrictive, or painful. This is my most important "rule". * Colors/patterns - I love combining different colors and/or patterns, but they need to have something in common in order for me to like them together, e.g. both patterns have a similar color or the colors are a similar shade. I have always hated wearing pastels/neons and tend to prefer jewel tones or earth tones (although I don't usually like mixing them together). * Statement pieces - I tend to prefer minimalist or maximalist combinations although I can't dress quite as maximalist as I would like due to the limitations of my wardrobe. * Silhouette - I tend to like all pieces form fitting or all relaxed. I have a weird hang up when it comes to skinny jeans w/ oversized tops but am perfectly fine w/ the combo of straight leg jeans with an oversized top or a form fitting top w/ skinny jeans. * Feminine/masculine - I like feminine elements to outfits but tend to combine them with something more gender neutral. For example, if I wear a white dress with lace on it, I'll pair it with black combat boots.  EDIT: Thanks for all the love, but I am not u/FriskyGatos \- just a huge fan. I guess my post wasn't clear in that I was citing her ideas rather than posting my own IG.

text:How do you dress for the (extreme) weather where you're from?	labels:Minnesota winter weather checking in! A hat helps keep body temp up and ears warm. The best hats I've found have a lining like a headband around the ears and the bottom of the hat. Some knits are too loose for warmth and this extra lining helps. Not sure what they call it but it works	episode_done:True
text:Technical/Labwear but make it fashion	labels:Welding educator here.  Honestly? I don't, for two reasons.  First and foremost, my clothing gets absolutely destroyed. Flames, rust, grease, sparks, dirt... It's not worth it to me to constantly have to replace high-priced items, and the "cute" pieces that I can generally afford are not something I would want to expose to flames unless I want it melted to my skin. I spend the most money on my boots, because I'm on concrete 100% of the time, but they aren't particularly fashionable. Comfort and safety are the main factors. Jeans, cotton shirts, hoodies, Carhartt, Dickies, etc. are all main staples.  Second, being in a field/environment that is almost exclusively male dominated, it is less feasible or, unfortunately, wise, to try and dress much differently than my fellow staff and students do. When I first started, I tried to wear cuter, form fitting things, but a lot of times that drew a lot of unwanted attention towards my physical appearance and away from my knowledge and experience. It seems to come off as less credible, which is already an issue with being a female educator in skilled trades.  As a compromise, I do a lot of fun makeup looks when I have the time in the morning!

These are almost all runway pieces and the majority of them weren't produced for sale. That said, if they were and I could afford them, I'd wear about 60% of what's in the album.  I included a bit of womenswear. There's more to draw from in womenswear, and the pieces here are wonderful.

text:People with an over the top personal style, how do you incorporate it into your day to day?	labels:Alternative clothing salesperson here: COMMIT. Nothing is worse than half-assing over the top styles. Also make sure it’s cohesive.

Make sure your hair and makeup match too.  Not to say that like, alt clothing people spring from the ground fully formed, obviously everyone takes time to build a wardrobe and that’s okay too! But imo to really shine it takes a bit more

My daily go-to is just eyeliner (waterline and top lid) and lipstick. Mascara if I remember. I never wear foundation or any other bases and I only do eyeshadow if I’m feeling creative.

Skin oils and acids are not good for fabrics, nor are cosmetics (deodorant, lotion, etc), not to mention that other people can smell your odour far sooner than you yourself can. I use a modern eco-friendly low-water front loader, so I don't feel guilty about depriving the planet of water.   And no, machine washing does not ruin your clothes, providing you use the correct wash cycle and detergent. I very rarely throw clothes out due to wear, even though I have washed many of them hundreds of times.
text:Same. Anything I wear for more than a few hours gets washed. Nothing falls apart and I hang everything but activewear and pre shrunk jeans and tees. Cold water and a short or gentle cycle gets everything clean.   Even in a coma you sweat more than you think and you’re always shedding skin cells.	labels:I hang all my active wear.

I know I sound like I came right out of FFS circlejerk, but dressing like that does get you compliments. Shirts, pencil skirts, pleated pants, they make you look like you put in effort when you... really did not lol.  My peers react well to me. So does my mom. So do my mom's friends. I love being validated by older women.  My large felt hat enforces social distancing.  Cons:  My current style really ages me. I'm a Zillenial, 24, and up until 2 years ago I could basically seamlessly blend in with their fashion. Nowadays, I really can't. I see the zebra print flared leggings, cow print fluffy hobo bags, giant puffy metallic coats and deep down I know I could never pull that off. It makes me feel old sometimes, and sometimes not in a good way.
text:I have this same ✨aesthetic✨ - classic style, New England prep vibes. Lots of pencil skirts, structured a-line skirts (bonus points if they're plaid, gingham, or tweed) with a blouse, turtleneck, or sleeveless tank/cardigan combo. Dark wash jeans, inoffensive striped sweaters, wool blazers, sensible shoes (block heels, espadrilles, leather ballet flats) in neutral colors. The occasional leopard print piece to add a little spice lol  Pros: I feel like it makes getting dressed SO easy - everything in my closet matches and is relatively cohesive!  Cons: Do I look like a rich college student at a private university? Or a suburban soccer mom who's obsessed with LL Bean? I also worry that people will assume I'm stuck up or unapproachable because my closet gives off a toned down Blair Waldorf vibe.	labels:	episode_done:True

I'm 27  years old, 1.77m tall and currently live in  Germany. Only after measuring myself, I realized how extremely slim I  am. Basically, all the measurements put me to size XXS.   Now I've tried out XS clothes in the past, but the issue was  always the length. German size XS is made for 168–173cm, XXS for  166–170cm, which is definitely a size too short for me. Reference: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clothing\_sizes#Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clothing_sizes#Germany)  I  mostly bought sizes M or S until now, but I realize that most shirts don't fit nicely and look a bit baggy.  Do you have any tips for where to look for clothes for my size? Would it be preferable to wear slightly baggy clothes that have the right length, or slightly shorter clothes with the right fit?
text:If you are very slim, and taller than average, congrats!   At first thought you might have what seems to be the default build a lot of trendier brands:   Zara, Armani Exchange, Saint Laurent Paris.etc     Additionally Eton, Eleventy and some other brands cater to extremely slim cut.  Whether you like how that looks on you will be a matter of opinion.

text:Didn’t they change their return policy so you can’t even return online orders in store anymore though	labels:I just got off chat with customer service where the guy told me my only option was to wait until lockdown is over and go to their store in Toronto. Fuck me for ordering a size too large right?	episode_done:True
text:How would you describe the quality of self-knit/self-made clothes vs. store bought?	labels:In my experience as a knitter for over 10 years, my handmade knits last longer than store bought clothes. With the exception of socks, which I refuse to ever knit again. Those get holes in them so fast that I literally cried because I spent hundreds of hours making them and used fancy ass yarn. Store bought socks for me only.  ETA:  I took some quick pics of my sock situation: Top pic is a handknit sock that started to get a hole, you can see my finger through the stitches. The matching sock had a huge hole at the heel and has already been unravelled to use on something else. Second pic is a comparison between Smartwool on top and my handknit sock using Wollmeise on the bottom. My stitches look huge in comparison to the store bought ones 😢 [https://imgur.com/a/WEHMRav](https://imgur.com/a/WEHMRav)
text:Me too. All my hand-knit sweaters are miles better than store bought sweaters. I think it comes down to the quality of the yarn and the fact that I use good techniques to keep the sweater from coming apart.     I went through a period when I was buying good quality second-hand sweaters and unraveling them for the yarn, but i quickly found that the yarn wasn't even twisted, just several individual fibers together. This leads to breakage, which leads to holes and pilling.     I also spend a ton of time on trial and error to get the right fit, making sure I'm happy with every detail.	labels:Nothing beats having your clothes match your own measurements perfectly. I prefer loose and comfortable, but I still want them to fit my shape.	episode_done:True
text:2020 Wardrobe Data Analysis	labels:I don't chart my clothing wears.  However, when purchasing something new, I make a mental calculation of the cost per wear.  It has to be $1 or less for me to buy it.  So if I buy a $10 shirt, I have to wear it (at least) 10 times.  I do make exceptions for special occasions, but it is 2020 so those are non-existent.  And with the exception of walking a red carpet or a black tie (or higher) level of formality, I have something in my closet that could work for the occasion (wedding, political fundraiser, etc).  If for some reason, I get invited to a black tie event, I'd rent my attire.  (And I'm never going to walk a red carpet.)	episode_done:True

text:Dream Unconventional/ Unrealistic Fashion Accessories- Discussion	labels:I’m Op here’s some of mine, ranked from most normal to weirdest. These are all at least partially ironic I should mention lol but feel free to joke and comment :  - Septum Chain Brooch - it’s really difficult to find a photo of what I’m talking about Ive only ever seen it in runway fashion. The closest I could find is [this one that connects to the ear instead.](https://m.aliexpress.com/item/33057876757.html?trace=wwwdetail2mobilesitedetail) essentially it just a nose ring with a chain that hangs down onto a brooch which is usually pinned on to a blazer. I would love to find one some day, however it does seem quite hazardous.  - Victorian walking stick / Parisol - I just know both would look fantastic with my wardrobe. A [parisol ](https://www.worthpoint.com/worthopedia/black-battenburg-lace-gothic-lolita-1692896768) like this would be oh so stylish and perfect for avoiding the sun and a [victorian walking cane ](http://www.catwalkyourself.com/fashion-dictionary/walking-stickcane/) such as this one would match my velvet blazer perfectly. Could also make for great self defense as historically they are weighted at the top for said reason!   - Art Dolls - so this one may need the most explanation and isn’t too serious but I feel carrying around one of these stylish beautiful art pieces in the same fashion rich teens carry chihuahuas would truly make me feel like the glam eccentric crazy artsy lady I have always dreamed of being. Truly a fun accessory. Especially if I could get its outfit to coordinate mine. I like animal ones like [This one](https://www.etsy.com/listing/712535682/stuffed-wolf-animal-art-doll-animal-wolf) but my absolute favorite dream one to own would be [This over 1,000 dollar anime one ](http://dolkus.com/mobile/detail.php?id=40202) . At that price I’d parade it around everywhere. Possibly peeking out of a purse. I have seen some fellow teens on tik tok put calico critters in overall pockets as a fun fashion statement so maybe it could work out for me. Lmao. (If anyone’s done anything similar let me know)

text:Brooks Brothers's Future Looks a Lot Like Menswear’s Past	labels:* Less SKUs. The amount of stuff BB sells is overwhelming.  * Do away with there weirdly named fit system. Change it to Extra Slim, Slim, Regular, Thicc Daddies * Revamp the BB website. It's been terrible for a long time. * Have the athleisure stuff, but also focus on high quality basics, again with less SKUs. Have something like an "essentials" line. The Navy Suit. The Charcoal Suit. The OCDB. The Chino. The Wool Trouser. Without fifty million variations thereof. You go now and it's like here are three navy suits with different kinds of stretch, here are four more with some kind of temperature controlling fabric. Just give me a half to full canvas lined 100% wool navy suit in various fits and sizes. In other words, simplify your menswear line to cut down on SKUs, and that will give you more room to play with sheep on skis and stuff (i think that does sound kind of cute, very Ralph Lauren). * Do away with Golden Fleece, Red Fleece. Mainline only. Again confusing to the consumer. * Where BB could play more is in areas like sport shirts. By all means offer your classics like blackwatch etc., but other menswear shops like Sid Mashburn or Todd Snyder offer all kinds of fun prints and colors while still feeling like classic #menswear.  i dunno, just riffing my own personal desires for BB. i don't know anything about running a large clothing manufacturer and retailer.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 13, 2021	labels:[jacket pics](https://i.imgur.com/wkZ7YDR.png)  I got a bunch of good light jackets from the year end sales, but I feel i should only keep 1 or 2 of these light jackets since where I live, the optimal time period for these is rather short (probably just mid-march to mid-april, and in october, other wise its too cold or too hot)  Of these 3 which of these should I keep (perhaps 1 or 2?)  left: twill harrington from PRL.  classic piece, although I wonder if I look a bit senior in it  middle: a fleece jacket from PRL. could be useful when layering under a rain jacket for winter, and by itself in spring or fall  right: a check jacket from zara. its somewhere in between a moto jacket and harrington in design.
text:My vote is for left. I don't love the pattern on the zara jacket with the bomber jacket cut and I think the fleece jacket actually makes the outfit look "older" than the PRL harrington if that's a quality that matters to you. Fleece will be warmer though.  If you were to return 1 I'd return the zara one. You could also extend the time you're wearing these jackets by playing around with layering, especially when its a fairly dry or warm-ish winter day.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Overdressing - Discussion	labels: Greetings! Op again-   I shared my opinions on this in this thread already but I thought I’d share what inspired this and see what you ladies think.   I recently have been having a good friend say in a half joking but sad way that she always feels so underdressed around me and has sometimes even started too ask me what I’m wearing before we hangout. I don’t mind answering her at all even if I just have a vague idea of what I’m going to wear if I see it in time. It seems to kind of upset her that she always feels underdressed even though I think she always looks great!  I really like dressing up for things even if it’s barely anything but I’d hate to make her feel that way. At the same time however I don’t want to put more effort in to look more casual then I’d really want. I question if it’s more my problem or if it’s more of an personal issue for her.
text:I mean it’s her issue, but I think if you wanna be a good friend it’d be nice to try and meet her halfway.

text:General Discussion - November 17, 2020	labels:Hot take time:  "It's a clash in formality" is a baseless and invalid criticism, and if we're going to ask lurkers/new people to do better than "it's just bad" then we should ask the same of our community  I saw very few criticisms of sneaker/dress shoe hybrids in the other thread that amounted to much more than just "they're different formalities so they're bad" but I've seen ties in casual outfits, jeans worn with tailoring, and suits worn with tank tops come off fantastic. Shit if we're gonna give Thom Browne credit for the short suit that's a massive formality clash.  Not saying that there aren't reasons to critiques sneaker/dress shoe hybrids but if you're gonna say that individual shoes are somehow objectively bad and *especially* if you're gonna say that an entire category (subgenre?) of shoes is irredeemable then I expect a better reason than "formality clashes are bad"  Also separate but related hot take:  Caring about the rules of formality is at worst barely-coated elitism and at best it's nerd shit and should be ignored
text:I think I use the "fomality clash" sometimes in simple questions.  All of these categories are weird, but sometimes someone wants feedback on an outfit and it looks bad and... something has to be said in addition to "looks bad". Sometimes it's "the colours don't match", sometimes it's "the shapes don't match" and sometimes it's just someone in suit trousers and a wrinkly linen shirt... and "this doesn't work because the trousers are so formal and the shirt is so not that" is the best I can tell that person.  Perhaps it should be made clearer that these aren't *rules* but *heuristics*. Not all clashes look good, but it's one of these things that can make something look bad sometimes.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Goals and Resolutions Check in: February	labels:My goals are going well! A couple of ours are essentially the same. Good luck, we got this!  1) Wardrobe Overhaul  At the beginning of the year, all I owned was athleisure. I was a very cozy, but very bored, person. So I’m working on filling my wardrobe with clothes that really make me happy, and it’s working! I’m in a fortunate position right now, so I’ve been spending the last stimulus check on ThredUp and Poshmark. I gotta say I am loving online thrifting.  2) Dress for my emotions rather than comfort.  Part of moving away from athleisure. My clothes really influence how I feel, so dressing up to look like a badass bitch makes me feel like a badass bitch. Even on days I work at home, I wear outfits to emotionally prep myself to enjoy being productive. I change into pjs when my work is done for the day, so I actually get to look forward to my comfy clothes rather than feel like it’s just another lazy day in leggings.  3) Focus on fit and proportions.  This one is harder but is making me feel the most ~fashionable~. I’m trying to identify how/why certain pieces work on me while others look slightly off. I take videos of myself where I make a bunch of tiny adjustments to my outfits to identify the little details I do or don’t like. This is definitely the biggest of my goals, and will take a long time to really figure out. I can often tell when something isn’t right about an outfit, but identifying that element is tricky.
text:Yessssss to all of your goals! Your reasoning definitely resonates with me... I feel so much better and more confident the days I put in effort as opposed to jeans a company polo or leggings and a shirt.   You’ve totally got this :) cant wait to see the end of year progress.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do you challenge yourself?	labels:Yes, I am doing a "challenge" right now. I love patterns, and most of my clothes are patterned - besides workout clothes. I also wear tons of dresses, as you can surmise they are patterned. I do have a few plain items, and usually they are used to wear under something patterned. E.g. I need to wear a shirt under a sweater or a tank under a wrap dress. I am terrible at building an outfit around all solids.   So that is my goal - finding solid colored items I am ok wearing standalone. And getting solid colored items that do not feel too boring. And as I am unpacking that, it means cut and color matter a lot for me. So I am working on finding my solid staples. It seems weird, but I am know for wearing prints, I go weeks without wearing solids.

text:AE Elgin - Before & After recraft pics	labels:DIY - a bit of a stretch as I paid for the work, I didn't do the work. I originally tagged as inspiration.   Goal - my brother started his own company. He is doing something very entrepreneurial for the first time in his life and I wanted to give him something that seemed like the kind of thing a business owner might wear. I am proud of him! I specifically selected the Elgin because it is a discontinued model and thought he might enjoy them more knowing you can't go to AE and just buy this shoe.  The details:  1. The Donor Shoe - Allen Edmonds Elgin sz 11.5D.  2. Picked up on Ebay for $18, the photos tell a realistic story of how rough they were. 3. I use Lance from Wyatt & Dad here in Charlotte, NC as my cobbler.  4. The uppers required a full stripping. The normal stuff - the previous owners were using the wrong color polish, seemed to never condition the leather, and there were black spots on the shoes. Don't know exactly what it was.  5. I wanted to give my brother a shoe that is versatile enough to wear to a meeting but a casual reminder that he is now the boss and can set the tone for how he presents himself. I liked the tread pattern because they are similar to another pair of AE Hamiltons that he has. He has always told me he finds them far more comfortable than the traditional leather sole.  6. Met up with Lance and we went through the sole options and I really liked the contrast of the light blue thread with the dark blue military aesthetic sole.  7. Later that day I was hunting around the internet for the right laces and was pleased to discover that Whisker made this design. I liked that the metal aglet matched the rugged feel of the sole design while the light blue matched the casual feel of the rest of the shoe.  8. The only original components from the donor shoe is the upper.  9. All in cost - $18 shoe + $10 S/H + $15 on laces + $176.99 on the total recraft = $223  Style wise: I imagine these to be worn with dark blue jeans and a sport coat. Comfortable enough to wear on a Friday night and with the right shirt they nice enough to wear to a tech startup meeting.
text:Woah, 176 is crazy cheap! How much did they charge to replace the insole?  Lotsa haters on this thread. I think the shoes are pretty dope. The blue adds a nice pop of color. The laces are a little much for me, but I would definitely wear these with brown laces	labels:	episode_done:True

text:People with crazy hair, how do you plan your outfits to go with your hair color?	labels:Mine isn't particularly crazy, usually a bit of purple or sometimes pink, though right now it's 100 % purple (actually indigo and plum if that matters).  I dress the same, though i have taken care recently to ensure i'm more business casual than normal.  In my workplace, trousers+tshirt are perfectly acceptable.  In order to help cushion the blow of 100 % purple instead of just streaks, i've upped my game to collared shirts instead of tshirts.  Though, i'm kind of crushing it on my last few projects and my director has told me so, so i'm not worried.  The fact that the department head (above the director) thinks i'm incompetent isn't going to be affected by hair colour or clothing, so i've just given up on convincing him.  If you are concerned specifically about colour and "matching", my wardrobe is 95 % black, 4 % purple, and 1 % rainbow.  So that matters basically zero ;)

text:Does anyone have a "uniform"?	labels:A few years ago I lucked into finding three black sheath dresses on clearance at JC Penney and some colorful cotton cardigans—thus began my love for capsule wardrobing. Paired with a simple black wedge, this was my preferred work uniform until I lost weight. I do enjoy having simple items that can be mixed up and color-blocked; as a dark winter who can pull off some dark autumn shades, I keep dark comfy pants, jeans, blavy tees, cardigans and sweaters in colors, and some black dresses in rotation. Seasonal changes are easy—long sleeves and pullover sweaters go away in warm temps, and I layer everything in winter. My feet are older than they should be, so I rely on Alegria mary janes (fun prints) and oxfords (solids) in blue, black, and brown as well as Hokas or Altras in whatever color happened to be on sale. I’m currently not able to work *and* manage my health at the same time, but I find having a capsule wardrobe of sorts to be liberating because I don’t have to stress over choices or whether something fits, and I can look professional to go to the doctor or curl up in bed either way. I relied too long on the whims of whatever crap was on sale; now I keep an eye out for things I want at a reasonable price and don’t buy it unless I know it will look and feel good for my unique situation.	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 03, 2021	labels:OK, so I'm 18, need to buy a good winter coat. Thought the post-Christmas sales would be a good time, so I hit Google. I'm thinking a pea coat is a good idea - I'm only gonna have one, and I like how versatile it is. Looks presentable in a formal setting, but works well with casual clothes too. Plus I just like how it looks in general.  Looking to stay as cheap as possible (under 100, if possible) without buying a piece of shit, and what I've seen points to pea coat on a budget ---> vintage. I'm all for used clothes and helping the environment and getting 100% wool for cheap but I'm a bit worried about buying one for two reasons.  1.	I know they were built to last but if I get a 1960s coat or so that’s >50 years old, is it still gonna hold up and be in good condition (assuming I find one that has been treated well)? Basically is it worth it over worse quality, but new coat? Bit leery on buying a 50-60+ year old coat 2.	I’m a stick (5’10, 120), and I’ve heard the fit on the navy issued coats can be very boxy, can anyone comment on that/can it be tailored at all?  One more question, if this is the best option, what’s the sweet spot in terms of age I should aim for? I’ll probably be limited just on size, trying to find a 34/36, but if I have options which are best?  Any help is appreciated!
text:it doesnt have to be vintage, you can find a fair amount of second hand peacoats for under 100$, just gotta look harder	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How has your style and shopping habits changed with age and financial standing?	labels:I grew up pretty poor, and now, I’m comfortable, though certainly not rich. When I was young (hs/college) I was intent on not looking poor, which I wrongly associated with not wearing the same clothes too many times, and needing to shop at the mall and buy brand new clothes. I focused on how something looked, not necessarily how it looked on me or if it matched my style. If it was on sale for a good deal, even if I didn’t have a lot to go with it, or it didn’t fit quite right I’d buy it. Now, my clothing budget is still pretty small by a lot of standards, but I know more about what I like and what I actually wear regularly. I don’t worry much about being an outfit repeater, so I don’t feel that pressure to shop. I still don’t have the budget to just buy what I want when I want it most of the time, but I have the time (because I have a wardrobe I like at this point) to really search out affordable options for things that I want. And second hand is the majority of what I buy because I know that I can get a better quality thing for usually about the same price as a new mall brand thing if I find it second hand.	episode_done:True

I don't know if I'll ever return to the cute shoes in my closet now that I've had almost a whole year with zero foot/leg pain.   MVPs of 2020: knock off Ugg slippers, black leather Puma flip flops (I live in SoCal so these are my go to get the mail shoe), and for the rare days where I go to run an errand I have been living in my black Nike Tanjun's and Superfeet "Stuart Black/Castlerock" tennis shoes.	episode_done:True

It is frustrating though in general, I’m with you.  I’m also with another comment that said they have a general look they always go with that saves them a lot of time/effort.

I find that they are quite flattering if you manage to find one that hits your waist or somewhere slightly above it.

text:Do you follow the conventional rules around "flattering your figure?"	labels:I've written about this before, but as someone who is 5'2 on a good day, I have stopped giving a shit about looking "longer and leaner."  In fact, I reject the idea that I should want to look taller. Maybe all those 5'7 women should be taking advice on how to make their legs look as stubby as mine. <--Obviously a joke but to make a point. How stupid is it that I should feel like my natural body is something to correct?  I'm an old woman, lol, and over the course of my life I have never found that my stubby legs (that I was once self-conscious about) have kept me from career advancement or from finding people who thought I was beautiful and wanted to have sex with me, so what's the freaking problem?  Fuck conventional figure flattery.  That being said, of course there are things I think look better on me than other things and I tend to wear the things I think look better in ways I think look better most of the time.  Except when the comfort or beauty of a garment is so outstanding it overrules that.  Thanks for coming to my TED talk.  There are cookies on the table in the back.

text:What did your mom teach you about fashion/style - and what did she not teach you?	labels:This is a really interesting question. I do not really remember my mom teaching me anything specific about style and fashion.  My mom is anti-makeup. She was one of those people who used the same tube of lipstick for 20 years. I feel like both of my grandmas did the same. My maternal grandma only wore lipstick to church. My paternal grandma put on lipstick when she left the house. Neither wore more makeup. I think part of this is related to their not really being a lot of foundation choices for Black women. I mean even now I only have a handful of options, it is getting better but it isn't easy. So I have never really been one for a lot of makeup. I go in waves of putting on mascara. And some lip product when going out. Day to day it is basically nothing, ocassionally highlighter. I focus on trying to take care of my skin. Probably because makeup wasn't really an option.  My mom has/had 7 sisters. Some of my aunts wore makeup and my mom was always like "that is so weird!" She in particular complained about one of her older sisters who over plucked as a teen young adult and had to draw in her eyebrows for the rest of her life. That totally made me scared to wax/thread/pluck. I did for a bit, but my brows never came back after that, so now it is like never. I have sparse brows (I am 42).  My mom and her siblings were all very stylish and fashion oriented. My mom was known as the best dressed PTA mom. She always had super cool big earrings too. My mom had a style point of view, while she cared about fashion. But she also had some weird body hangups. (She is a slim pear shape - hated her legs, and was opposed to bathing suits).  One of my fave stories about my mom is how she always told us that when she was in her 20s and living in DC/Chicago she said she was always checking out the prostitutes for style tips. She tells us they were super stylish. LOL.  As a kid, I think my mom had fun helping us be "stylish" but she was also very old school in some ways, and we had to wear dresses/skirts/tights/hose/slips for any dress up occasion. It was scandalous to go bare legged! I had to beg to do it when I got to high school in the spring and summer. It was not allowed at church. (She wasn't anti-pants - just for dress up occasions).  I think her way to instill "fashion" into me was to subscribe to all the fashion magazines! I had all those teen ones growing up: Sassy, YM, Seventeen, and later Vogue. But before I had my own magazines to read, I was always looking a Jet and Soap Opera Digest to see their outfits (mom's magazines).  Things were always a bit tricky for me, because once I hit puberty, I was basically at the top of the size range and had a curvy figure that was hard to fit. I was also way bustier than my mom. She was in the small band B cup range and I was more like an medium band H (though I didn't find that out later).  When my mom turned 40ish, she decided she was an old lady, and needed to dress like one. So she started wearing those shapeless elastic waist pants, baggy shirts, and those "nurses" shoes as they were called. She has been dressing that way in the last 30 years - plus random remnants of my and my sisters high school wardrobes.  I do not really feel like my mom really said much in particular about fashion - beyond setting up the rules like - no cleavage! Don't show off your butt! And this conservative southern mom rules she had. She was always concerned about us being perceived as "fast" so she wanted to keep us covered up. Other than that it was dressing appropriate for the occasion. I was able to experiment how ever I wanted.  My mom always had a large wardrobe, and she loved to bargain hunt. She was opposed to spending money on clothing (my dad was always willing to invest). So when clothing shopping in the pre-autonomy days, we always went to Kmart/Ross/TJ Maxx. We'd try to get dad to take us to the mall to go to Esprit and Nordstrom - because mom wouldn't pay for that stuff, but dad would! When we got older (middle school-ish), the shopping process changed. Mom would take us to get the basics, and then we would have a discretionary budget to use for whatever clothing we wanted, and we'd get dropped off at the mall to choose whatever.  But to be honest, I do not remember limits on what I could choose - other than using those rules.  I feel like my mom was good about directly teaching us how things should fit. And while I haven't really gotten my own tailoring down, she was a passable sewist, and she made some of her own alterations on clothing. So I learned that things could be adjusted. She always needed to hem her pants (she is tall with short legs) and take in the waist.  My mom had no clue about dressing for a busty figure. I guess or a larger one. But while my sister and I are a good big larger than mom, we are lucky in the sense that we have hourglass-y shapes which still have some of the same issues she had as a pear shape so it was transferable.  I guess the most important rules from mom were really about understanding what to wear for a particular occasion.  I have no plans to have kids, but I love helping other people shop - and my number one lesson is to try all sorts of stuff on, you never know if it'll work! And experiment, experiment. And of course about proper fit as much as possible.

I have a budget of about 200-300 euros (willing to exceed by a little if it's worth it). Are there any particular brands I should be considering? What should I be looking for in order to determine if the boot is well made? I would appreciate it if you could redirect me to a few models as well.
text:Look for stitched construction--Goodyear welted, Blake, Blake/Rapid. If the description doesn't say or if it says "bondwelt", it is cemented (glued). You might only get a year or two out of those. The description should include the type of leather used (generally, black calf is what you would want for Chelseas). Better brands will also say which tannery it came from. Avoid ones with vague descriptions like "genuine leather", as this may be heavily processed (corrected) and coated with a polymer that will eventually crack and peel.        Herring's Shoes has some house brand boots made in Spain that look decent (check the sale page). Pediwear UK may have some UK brands on sale in your range (Loake, Edward & James--made by Berwick, Barker). Meermin is often recommended as an "entry level" choice, but many people report an extended break-in due to stiff leather. While a Spanish company, their footwear is made in China (if that matters to you). Other brands that may be slightly above budget are TLB Mallorca and Carlos Santos. If you don't like the idea of leather soles, you can always have a cobbler put on a rubber sole protector (aka Topy) for 30-40 Euros.	labels:This should've been the most upvoted answer. Great advice here, I think I'll increase my budget a little and look into TLB and CS.	episode_done:True
text:Guidance organizing a suit for my fiancé for his father's funeral during lockdown	labels:I'm going to be real, he needs a new suit jacket if he can afford it. A 10 year old budget suit from high school is the opposite of high quality.  Do you live near a Suit Supply? They are a Dutch company so will probably have high quality clothes that fit him. I'd suggest getting an entire outfit from there. They have EXCELLENT customer service and will handhold him through the process in as pain free a way as possible.
text:The problem is that we are in full lockdown (and will be at least through January). Also I want him to get a good-quality and well-fitting suit for our wedding. If he gets a suit now (however rushed that would have to be), he would insist on wearing that to the wedding – I agree with him that it makes no sense to own two suits with our lifestyle.  We are in Europe/	labels:I'd say when the time comes, suitsupply would be a good place to get a new suit for the wedding. Their best value is their suits, but if he needs anything else, you might as well pick it up from there. The staff know what they're doing for the most part and will be able to pair things well, rather than having to combine things from other places. Since your fiancé isn't a fan of shopping, it'll be easier to get everything from one place.   Feel free to ask again about the wedding once that gets closer!	episode_done:True

text:Do you name your favorite outfits?	labels:I have a few named for their aesthetic, sure.   I have:  Tomura - Named after a villain (my favorite character) in the anime My Hero Academia because it gives off dark, sinister vibes. A black beanie, a dark burgundy or navy sweater, a long  black coat reminiscent of a trench coat layered on top, black skinny jeans, and combat boots. My grey fingerless gloves and a heavy black/grey scarf if I'll be outside.  The cozy cool aunt - Dark jeans, a neutral tank top tucked in, a long wool cardigan (either solid camel or a two toned black and burnt orange one), a light printed scarf, riding boots, and either a beanie or some dangly beaded earrings.  Errand mom / The Jennifer - I'm not a mom but named after my mom for an outfit I have spotted her wearing in family photos when she was my age and an outfit she still wears to run small errands. Lighter wash jeans, a crewneck sweatshirt (my favorite is dark green and says "kindness is magic," and black Vans.  I really should name more of my outfits though. It seems like a fun and efficient way to categorize my eclectic and somewhat confusing wardrobe.
text:Errand Mom! I have a really similar outfit and I am definitely going to start calling it that	labels:A friend and I use the term “Park Mom Shoes” to describe casual but upscale shoes a well-off mom would wear to play dates or picking the kids up from school.

text:Noel Fielding X Fendi menswear colab	labels:I see Noel Fielding. I remember the Great British Bake Off. I updoot.  When I think of Fendi, I'm not a fan due to the overt branding on the baguettes. I don't think this collection really strikes me as interesting, though I am a fan of look 31 and the blue piping detail. The graphics also don't excite me a ton, except for the cursive Fendi coat in 23 (and I actually love the pop of the turtleneck and gloves and piping - so whimsical!) This collection confuses me as it's simultaneously very muted but also funky, but I don't feel as though there's cohesive messaging. I don't know Noel from anything besides GBBO, but I would have expected or liked a l'il more goth and/or more color out of the collab.	episode_done:True

text:Do You Ever See A Cute Outfit, Try To Replicate It And End Up Hating It On Yourself? How Did You Fix That? Did You Ever Get The Answer As To Why It Didn't "Look Right" On You?	labels:> So... I'm in the "body types are crud" camp because I am a "pear" but I have a large bust and broad shoulders.  You can't be a pear if your shoulders are broader than your hips. Pears have hips broader than shoulders, but your shoulders might be sloped OR straight. Did you mean you have straight shoulders?   Without seeing a photo of you, it sounds to me like you are a mesomorph/athletic build hourglass. I.,e. shoulders and hips about the same width, with proportionately small waist. (Bear in mind-- shoulders being same width as hips is NOT a measurement-- it's a visual. Take a photo of yourself wearing yoga pants and a tight fitting top or body suit. Visually, do your shoulders look as wide as your hips?)  To answer your question, yes. Always when I was shopping with my friend who's the exact opposite body type as me (she's a pear and I'm an inverted triangle). Everything that looked amazing on her, looked horrible on me.   But, also, vice versa.  I cannot wear the same as my sister either, and she's an hourglass. Spent way too many years growing up gaining a complex from her hand-me-downs that fit me all wrong.
text:I'm just squatty. Like, my hips are the widest part of me, but not by much. My shoulders look broad because I am short and thick : / think Lord Of The Rings Dwarves lol!   It's exhausting XD DX	labels:If your shoulders appear broad, then you are likely not pear shaped. By measurement, I should be considered a “pear” but in reality I’m an hour glass. Even with a 15” increase between my hips and shoulders. I was also an athlete in college, the lightest I’ve ever been is in the 160s, I have a long torso/ short legs and am of average height for your reference.   I strongly recommend you try dressing in some hourglass friendly styles (especially something that you can buy cheaply to try out the style like wrap dresses). Anything with a flare on it (like a circle skirt) will help define your waist and show of your hips.	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- November 04	labels:Guys, I bought an off-the-rack suit in a very good sale, made and sold by a good local brand.  I was wondering if you guys could tell me whether it need any adjustment. I already ask them to put the waist a little bit in and seems good in this area.  However, it seems to have some extra fabric in the arm area. What are you guys thought? Can this area be changed? I usually wear a 48 regular suit, this is a 50 slim - I tried the 48 slim, but the pants were TOO tight.  Front  [https://i.imgur.com/NqJ1fz4.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/NqJ1fz4.jpg)  Back  [https://i.imgur.com/NMTqnwB.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/NMTqnwB.jpg)  Rear side  [https://i.imgur.com/GCYPfZc.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/GCYPfZc.jpg)  [https://i.imgur.com/wdF4AY3.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/wdF4AY3.jpg)  [https://i.imgur.com/MOpBgUz.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/MOpBgUz.jpg)
text:There is no way you'd fit into a 48 anything in this cut. On the front shot, it already looks like there is a slight bowing of your left lapel, indicative of needing more room in the chest. I also don't think you'd want the coat any shorter.  Sleeve length is fine. The lack of visible shirt cuff is a shirt sleeve length problem, not a coat sleeve length issue. The coat sleeve just about ends on the bump of your wrist where the wrist bone is.  Edit:   rear shot - you have prominent shoulder blades, , and a bit of wrinkling up near the collar which may be due to you having a more erect posture than the coat pattern is expecting. This is a bit more advanced alteration than your bog standard dry cleaner is likely going to want to touch. I honestly don't know if a good alternationist would even want to touch it - the wrinkling seems more pronounced on your left shoulder, and I am not sure why. On some coats, I have had that alteration done - "shortening the back" in tailoring speak as it is achieved by detaching the collar, and shortening the back to eliminate the extra fabric causing the wrinkly.   The sleeves are definitely hanging weird in the rear and side shots. I don't have a lot of reps needing any alterations in that world, so I don't really know if that is something that can be improved with alterations.  Overall, the coat body is fairly reasonable from a fit standpoint - a hair more room in the chest would help. I'd recommend asking a good alteration about their thoughts on the sleeves.  Not a lot of photos of the pants.	labels:Wow, I'm really greatful for your through answer. Very helpful indeed!  Indeed, the problem regarding the sleeve lenght seems to be caused by the shirt sleeves.   About the suit cut, I tried, in the store, the 48 fit (I actually asked for some tips here), and it really seemed I little bit tight. Some pics about it:   [https://i.imgur.com/APAgceC.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/APAgceC.jpg)  [https://i.imgur.com/kY5XYpH.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/kY5XYpH.jpg)  Regarding this suit I bought (the 50 slim), do you think the shoulder lenght is fine? I doesn't seem to have a lot of extra fabric there, though I'm worried about this extra fabric in the rear area. I hope this can be solved.  In what concern the wrinkling in the collar area, I believe this is because I have scoliosis (one shoulder is higher than the other), though I'm not sure about it.	episode_done:True

text:Do you: 1) keep all of your wardrobe equally diverse, or 2) keep all of your wardrobe minimal, or 3) keep some pieces relatively similar while diversifying others?	labels:1) I unified my style. Barely any patterns for tops -- only classic patterns. I avoid brights like the plague and only go for pastels, dark colors, whites, grays, blacks, and browns.  2) I rotate seasonally now that I'm up North  Shoes, jackets, jewelry: I have rules for the majority, but break them for a single statement piece.  Shoes:  * Black leather shoes for the majority * one pair of brown shoes * Heels are neutral colored. Mostly black, but 1-2 fashion pieces like wooden clogs w/ leather tops are fine * Black, nice, fashion sneakers that never get dirty (Like an all-black Nike Air) * Black Doc Martens || converse to dress up leggings or boots, wear to concerts, romp around in * 3 open-toed summer shoes -- beach, walking, and birkenstocks 😂  Jackets:  * Black leather -- 1 hip-length + 1 long calf-length * Raincoats can be bright ☀️ * 1 technical puffer jacket  Jewelry:  * Daily-wear has no chunkiness * Necklaces of various lengths, with the same chain weight * Mix of pendants and beaded stuff, etc * 1-2 black/silver collared necklaces for concerts + parties * Prefer silver. I pick a color for my facial piercings and keep the same for fashion.  Tights:  * Lightweight: Exclusively sheertex (unbreakable!!!!!!) * Winter: Fleece-lined pseudo-sheer tights ([Not these specific ones](https://www.amazon.com/Flawless-Translucent-Pantyhose-Stretchy-Leggings/dp/B0827P886B), but similar)  \---  I see you're in a warm place, so I'll give you my "As an ex-Floridian..." advice :-)  When I lived in Florida, it was loud tops \_all the time\_. Chiffon + polyester usually. And bright, bright dresses. It made it hard to declutter my closet because everything only went with one other thing, and I felt like I needed an entire rainbow in my closet.  After living up north in NYC, I figured out that:  1. having simpler patterns and colors isn't really boring if they're interesting cuts or well-made 2. layers make you look infinitely more put together than a single shirt -- regardless of how nice the item is.  If I had to live in Florida again, I'd...  1. mostly switch to wrap tops with tanks underneath 2. lightweight blouses with tanks or t-shirts underneath (I find that Banana Republic is boss for this.) 3. For dresses, [this](https://www.outdoorvoices.com/products/w-the-exercise-dress?variant=12507331985486&https%3A%2F%2Fwww.outdoorvoices.com%2Fproducts%2Fw-the-exercise-dress%3Fvariant%3D12507331985486%3Futm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&campaignid=11810545080&adgroupid=112736383417&utm_term=&gclid=CjwKCAiAouD_BRBIEiwALhJH6F2Rc0xP-UKFefwQRCdLMPx9a666PcFnpsWQ09G_OImHW-gMliDkihoCyekQAvD_BwE) would be my go to dress for every-day wear (I wish it were more in season up north!!!). It's a little short for work, BUT ITS ALSO A SKORT, which makes it king in my wardrobe. 4. Find shorts that I love. Up north, I also discovered that there are shorts that are comfortably long, but also don't look like grandma pants. This was a \*game changer\* for me, because ever since I was a kid, the shape of my thighs would drive the shorts into my crotch. Having comfy shorts that actually fit is 😻. [These are the shorts](https://www.alderapparel.com/collections/shop/products/take-a-hike-shorts). They're not fashion cute, but they're perfect for travel or anything where you'll be outside.

text:This is the most unbelievably helpful comment!! Thank you so much. I’m in such a similar position right now - I feel like 25% of my closet can only be paired with one or two other items, so even though I have far too many clothes, I feel trapped in repeating the same few outfits. Also, I’ve always loved the few months of alabama winter because I love how layers look, but I’ve never put much thought into trying layers during warmer months. You mentioning layering tanks under lightweight blouses is something I’m absolutely going to try.   I have a few questions, if you don’t mind? How would you pair colors when layering tanks under blouses if most pieces you have are neutrals? I never wear navy, so that isn’t an issue, but are other neutrals ever said to be a bad match with one another? Secondly, you mention using a nude tank for structure. What’s the difference in layering for a certain look versus structure?	labels:	episode_done:True

text:How do your clothes wear out?	labels:For me, it’s typically the elasticity of fabrics start to give and the items no longer fit correctly or if it’s a bottom, they no longer “stay up”. This usually happens with leggings or panties after about 5 or more years of regular wear with caring for the items properly.  I also had a faux leather jacket wear out after 6 years of regular wear. The faux leather ended up “peeling off” or something like that.
text:Thank you for bringing this up about leggings, it happens a lot now with my below natural waist yoga pants, especially in the back.  Now stores have high waisted pants in stock so I thought I had fixed the problem (me) but a lot of my yoga pants are 5-8 years old.  The inexpensive brushed leggings with an elastic waistband are all perfect.  I actually have one pair of Nike running pants from the 90’s and they are still good.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Boba's Ultra Basic Steps For Developing Style and Outfits (version 1)	labels:This guide is actually really comprehensive and goes into the finer details. I think it’s easy to be like “just look at the basic bastard and go from there” and even some of the guides on the sidebar aren’t that great or informative. Developing a style takes time, takes years and a lot of mistakes in choices. Still I think taking a moment outwardly and asking “what do I want my style to be” and using the questions really would have had me avoid some of the mistakes I made and maybe sped me up to where I am now
text:Absolutely agree. Learning the technicalities behind stuff is great and all, but you really need to hash out your own taste otherwise that stuff is useless. I think having a style journal where you reflect and elaborate more is great. What kind of style, shape, fabrics, colors, patterns, etc are all questions you need to answer to develop better style. Having a journal or way to reflect on prompts gives you not only a think tank for you aesthetic but it also can inform how you purchase and style things. Lots of beginners just have no idea how to start developing, I certainly didn’t.	labels:	episode_done:True

Also, after about 6 months of wear, I can confidently say the Auralee seamless tee is my favourite one that I own. I immediately knew it was gonna be my favourite as soon as I received it but I wanted to see how it was after many wears. One of the best features about it is that it's so soft but still drapes so nicely. And any wrinkle it develops after being folded in the closet basically straightens itself out after being worn for about 10 minutes. Shit! now i'm looking for more in different colors.

Even Dave chappelle noted how many black men trying to make it ended up in drag... before he fled for Africa  Idk just a thought from someone with an open mind enough to consider this lol	labels:Inshallah	episode_done:True

text:Influencers with Jobs: A Brief Collection	labels:Style Apotheca on Youtube is a pharmacist!   I definitely prefer to keep up with influencers who have real jobs for a few reasons.   Firstly, I don’t love when every other post or video is an ad. It makes it difficult to differentiate between actual personal style content and what’s just an ad for a company I’m not interested in shopping at. I don’t like being Sold something every time I watch a style video, and I find you get that less from influencers who get income from day jobs.  Secondly, as you say, there is a bit more realism in what they’re posting. Style doesn’t happen in a void, it has to happen in our daily lives. I don’t wear four-inch heeled boots to work, and I don’t like watching a college-age girl try and make Work Relatable content by making “Work Outfits” with four inch heeled boots. Influencers who have day jobs understand what it is boring office employees like me are looking for in a work outfit 😊 sure, maybe because of their “influencing” work they spend more money buying high-end clothing items that I’m simply never going to justify buying, but I don’t tend to follow people like that for very long.

text:2020 Gift Megathread	labels:Since this holiday will be spent far apart from a lot of family that we usually see, I'm thinking of mailing out cookies (and maybe other desserts). Has anyone done this before or have any advice? Also would love any cookie recipes that people have tried and can vouch for, especially if they have a fun twist or more grown-up/unusual flavors!  The main issue is that since this would be a lot of packages, 1-2 day priority shipping cost gets out of hand quickly. My previous packages though have had a \~5 day shipping time, which seems a bit worrisome for packaged goods. But I've also seen that because it's the winter, the cold will help and also using cookie types that keep well (ex: covered with icing). Is it probably worth it to shell out for that faster shipping?
text:I have experience on the shipping front. Bake them fully and freeze them before shipping. Avoid iced ones, they don't ship well unless you want to spend a lot on dividers and things to keep them from touching. Harder cookies ship better. You'll want to wrap them in paper, then foil, and bubble wrap the entire packet.	labels:Thanks so much – this is super helpful info! I haven't thought about freezing the cookies after baking but that sounds like a good idea! Do you find that it changes the texture of the cookie?	episode_done:True
text:I want to be that bada*** biCTH (Ik it's spelt wrong, it's meme bro lol sry. Plus idk if we can swear, I don't post) tl;dr at the end cuz I tend to rant :)	labels:The confidence comes with time. Buy what you like, wear it were you are feel safe. You might start by just wearing it around your room. Taking selfies and such. Get a feel for how you wear the clothes for yourself. Eventually start pushing your boundaries a little. Be paciente with yourself  This will get easier as you get older, think of your age as an advantage for your adventure not a hindrance. Do the same thing with your body. When I was your age, I was self-conscious of my big butt and thighs. Now they are in style.  You are enough as is
text:Aw thank you :). You're really sweet. Maybe the age thing is an advantage because who when they are my age really knows/knew what they like lol.

text:BoF: J. Crew's New CEO has a Survival Plan: Edit out the Ugly	labels:Middle-aged person here and copping to my age only because it legit adds context:  I was in high school when I started getting the J. Crew catalog, in the late 1980s. [Linda Evangelista was one of the models](https://silklacewool.tumblr.com/post/163833033703/barbiescanner-j-crew-1989-linda-evangelista), right as she was beginning her career, which should give you an idea of the time period; she had her little mushroom haircut and I remember her in a long-sleeved t-shirt and, like, flannel pajama shorts.  For a lot of Gen Xers like me, the appeal to J. Crew in those days rested in two things: the quality *and the styling in the catalog* \-- they'd do layouts which were capsule wardrobe before capsule was a thing, they'd show [women wearing the men's clothing in cute ways](https://nibsblog.wordpress.com/2010/01/19/menswear-for-women-1994/), and they'd emphasize [the standards you could expect to see season after season](https://assets.vogue.com/photos/59f371a211143b4f8402f7da/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/06-jcrew-reissues.jpg). So if you couldn't afford the barn jacket out of your allowance in 1989, you could rest assured it would still be there in 1990.  (I still have two barn jackets from 1991, plus a lovely guava-pink cotton v-neck tee I bought in summer 1993 and a roll-neck sweater from 1995; the only reason I don't have two fantastic ribbed merino v-necks from 1998 is because the moths got to them in 2011 while I was distracted on maternity leave.)  That catalog was a really effective piece of marketing because you could come back to it again and again, and absorb [a particular type of preppy-but-cooler presentation](https://theculturetrip.com/north-america/usa/articles/90s-nostalgia-prep-school-chic-and-the-j-crew-catalogue/) from it.  For the girls in my college dorms, Catalog Day was a big deal. We'd get together and read through and comment on the styles and assess how it would all work with the stuff we already had.  The catalog is gone, the website now offers far fewer styling inspirations and there's way too much stuff. And that's not even getting into the quality issues or the pricing.  The brand is unappealing to the people who used to be its core constituency; there's no value there because I'm not seeing fresh ways to wear well-made basics. I mean, freakin' [Primary.com](https://Primary.com),  a children's site,  does a better job on its site of showing how to mix and match its basics for fun and personal style.  J. Crew needs to edit the hell out of its inventory and maybe reconsider what value they can bring to consumers that other elevated-basics lines like Cuyana and Everlane aren't offering.  Perhaps younger consumers are attuned to a digital-first model for remixing/restyling retailer offerings and Instagram and TikTok work for them, but maybe J. Crew needs to consider [a catalog to revive that emotional connection with their older customers](https://www.townandcountrymag.com/style/fashion-trends/a32434902/j-crew-bankrupty-catalog-nostalgia/) or create a new type of communal, social catalog event with younger ones.
text:>a particular type of preppy-but-cooler presentation  I love your post.  I'm 45, albeit, single and my life is more akin to a 30-35 year old.

text:Fellow clothing trackers, what coveted items are you tracking now?	labels:A good, buttery brown leather crossbody purse. After two years of searching, I found the PERFECT shape and size at MadeWell. I placed my order in late August 2020, and still had not received the item by November. I knew it was a 6 week waiting time for shipping, but since it was well over 9 weeks by then, I finally called MadeWell asking where my purse was.  Turns out they had sold out of the item and erroneously did not take it off their website, and it still allowed you to purchase the purse. I was livid, but if anything, extremely heartbroken because I was sooo looking forward to this purse, and one of the few bright and good things I had to look forward to at that time in my life (life was throwing me some crazy curveballs).  I have yet to find the perfect buttery brown leather crossbody, the right size, color and a smooth surface. And under $300. Keeping my fingers crossed!
text:Not sure what shape you’re looking for, but I recently bought a brown leather crossbody bag from Portland Leather that looks exactly like a madewell tote, and it’s perfect. Better than the madewell one (I’ve had a couple) and I got it off their “almost perfect” section for less than the Madewell. There are no flaws that I can tell. Highly recommended.	labels:+1 for Portland Leather Goods!!  Not sure what the first poster's style is, but I have [this bag](https://www.portlandleathergoods.com/collections/almost-perfect-sale/products/almost-perfect-festival-bag) and I love it. It's beautiful and such a steal for the price. Infinitely better quality than what you'd get from Madewell, like you said. I have no idea what's technically 'wrong' with mine, but if you want to spend just a bit more you can get the ['perfect' version](https://www.portlandleathergoods.com/collections/crossbody-bags/products/festival-bag?variant=30269020373074).  I have a few other items from PLG and the quality of the leather on all of them is incredible, again way better than what you'd get for a similar price from Madewell. Highly highly recommend taking a look.	episode_done:True

I reverse googled the image to find it came from a shop in the UK (I’m in the US). Forgot about conversion and I ended up paying over $60 just for the sweater, not including shipping. My parents were so angry I spent all the money I had on one single clothing item but I still have the sweater about 10 years later and it continues to be a staple item

text:Fast Fashion: What are your wardrobe all-stars?	labels:I have a gray sweater from H&M that I’ve had for the better part of 10 years. It accidentally ended up in the donation pile, so I had to re-buy the exact same sweater from Poshmark, but the fact remains that I’ve been wearing the same style/color/size H&M sweater that I first bought new in high school, and if not for the mishap with the donation pile, it would have been the same sweater the whole time rather than the sweater and its dupe. It has kind of an oversized fit, where the body is a big square and the arms are on the skinny side, and it’s lower in back so I can wear it with leggings. I got my first tattoo in that sweater. I think fast fashion isn’t fast if you wear the item for eight years instead of eight weeks.  Honorable mention goes to my GAP medium wash Cheeky Straight jeans, which I wear almost every day because they go with everything and are so dang comfy! I’ve lost a little weight since I bought them so they’re slightly loose, but that just means I can comfortably have a big meal or lounge around the house in them. If I continue to lose weight and change size significantly, I’ll probably repurchase in a size that fits as intended, but for now they’re perfect and I intend to wear them until they can’t be worn anymore.	episode_done:True
text:How do I feel more comfortable "dressing up"?	labels:If you feel uncomfortable wearing a fancy blouse and skirt, try wearing a skirt with a sweater! I absolutely love that look. And to address the people asking "why are you dressing up?" Don't worry about it! Just answer honestly: "I really like this blouse! Or: "I love to look nice!" Many people really appreciate nice dressing. I'm still in school, and though I can appreciate a cute sweatpants fit I'd be ecstatic to see a nice skirt and cardi combo. Make it normal, and people will appreciate it!	episode_done:True

text:How do you style your existing wardrobe in a way that doesn’t get boring?	labels:I also use Stylebook and have made it my little quarantine project to make minimum 10 outfits out of each item of clothing I have and to make the 10 outfits for each item I add going forward. Some items are easily in the 50s of outfits (black jeans, plain boots) but some of them were trickier, like silver boots or an off the shoulder dress. I made it work though and came up with a lot of outfits that I wouldn’t have thought of before!   In your situation I would try to pull one item of clothing out that you haven’t worn in a while and try to make 3-5 outfits from it (just writing them down). Some might be duds but you will probably find a few you like for each piece. Also, if lots of pieces are out of sight, you might not realize that some of them go really well together.

text:Your thoughts on leopard print (and animal prints in general)	labels:I never cared for it myself for the longest time but have changed my opinion in recent years.  I do agree that a stripes (vs dots) pattern can be used as a neutral basic piece. It can still go terribly wrong though if the print is loud, worn with other animal prints, or is poorly made.  I generally will only wear 1 piece at a time, such as shoes or a scarf or purse, and in a small print.	episode_done:True

text:How do you balance bright statement pieces with a capsule wardrobe?	labels:I am like you - I like colors and patterns. A super minimal capsule wouldn't work for me at all. As a thought exercise, I considered what I would limit my wardrobe to.  I have a pretty limited color palette, though I am adding a little bit. My neutrals have hisrtoriclally been grey and black. I recently added millennial pink to the list.  I am now adding taupe/olive and mustard to my neutrals. My colors are basically hot pink and fuchsia (various shades) and burgundy.  I retired cobalt blue from the list.   So all of my patterned stuff has one of neutrals and my accent colors. So they feel pretty cohesive.   This is what my edit might look like, based on what I wear the most. There is no way I could get down to 20 items, but 50ish is my number!  * I wear a lot of dresses, so my capsule would have probably 8-12 dresses    * 3-4 "work"    * 3-4 "casual"    * 1-2 formal    * 1-2 "travel" * 3-4 skirts (at the moment I am loving midi skirts) * 2-4 leggings/joggers that are not for the gym * 3 blazers: one patterned, one colorful, one neutral * 3 cardigans: dark neutral, light neutral, colorful * 2 jeans: one dark skinny, one light to medium straight leg * 2-3 pants in my colors * 2-3 layering tops * 4-6 solid blouses/tee shirts in my colors * 3-4 patterned blouses * 3-5 sweaters/sweatshirts  * 1-2 jumpsuits: one patterned, one solid * rain jacket * cold weather jacket * casual jacket * sporty jacket  My take is, feel free to set your own neutrals.  You may not need more than one traditional one.  In my wardrobe I find that burgundy, mustard, and light pink basically go with everything anyway! So they can be used in place of a traditional neutral. I also found once I was picky about the colors in my patterns, they were so much easier to mix into my wardrobe.    My patterns are generally black and white or have some pink. So it is really easy to pair them with my pink items. Burgundy looks great with them all too. At the moment I want to wear more solids, and I am working on filling in my wardrobe with solids in my accent colors (and not the neutrals).  I'll probably slowly purge my wardrobe in the coming years and further hone in and eliminate duplicates, but I won't give up colors and patterns!
text:Thanks for the detailed reply! My issue with having a lot of clothing isn't that I don't want it, but that I'll be moving overseas at the start of the year and will only be able to bring 1 duffel bag of clothes, including shoes. I'll try to wear as much as I can while we travel so I can bring a bit more, but I'll be very limited on space, hence me trying to get outfit sets as much as possible before then. I would love to bring a bunch of cute statement pieces but I also don't want to look like a toddler who dressed herself! LOL	labels:So not really related to what to pack, but my brother and sister in law moved overseas last year and they ended up paying for extra luggage as it was so hard to fit their whole lives into 1 suitcase each. So they took 2 suitcases each instead, which was a lot more manageable. Just an option to consider!   They also packed up some vacuum seal bags with some of their other favourite things that they couldn't fit, and whenever any family or friends go over to visit them we bring along one of their vacuum bags so they've gradually been getting more of their stuff delivered to them haha.	episode_done:True

I had separate clothes for class, going out, and interviews. Now I'm in a much narrower range of casual to dressy casual with a few formal interview/presentation pieces. Find a good work outfit (not necessarily in black, navy is a good choice too) on the more formal side (think Calvin Klein) for when you need it and have fun with the rest of your wardrobe.	episode_done:True

text:Tips for reducing impulse buying/careless spending?	labels:I'm a bit late to this thread but I just want to share my story with impulse buying:  Vintage/secondhand shopping is my weakness, and in my country (I live in SE Asia), there is a huge market of  Instagram/Facebook sellers that sell vintage clothes at relatively cheap prices, which makes shopping really easy. Because everything is so cheap, I end up buying a lot more. Though my bank account hasn't quite suffered yet, my closet definitely has. It's stuffed to the brim with things that would take me years and years to wear. I made a wishlist and kept telling myself that once I found all the items on it I would stop, but I just kept adding to the wishlist and rationalizing it.  About a week ago, I ordered from this seller that doesn't have a lot of followers and refuses to send me additional photos (those things should've sent up a red flag, but I've bought from small sellers before and it turned out fine, so this time I stupidly shrugged it off, thinking they're just new), and now the package is nowhere to be seen and the seller is ignoring my messages. Luckily, it isn't a lot of money (about $13), but I'm pissed at myself for letting my impulse get the better of my judgment. But at least it taught me a lesson! I'm not quitting cold-turkey, but I'll definitely be a lot more mindful of my future purchases.	episode_done:True

text:Gorpcore: How Arc’teryx Parkas and Salomon Hiking Boots Became High Fashion	labels:This is going to sound strange but hear me out and it'll make more sense.   The young and soon approaching middle age peoples prefer to live in the city. People are shifting towards walkable cities, or at least are trying.  People approaching their thirties, unlike in year's past, are not moving to the suburbs.   Living in the city, means that you would mostly not have a car. Using public transport, or walking/biking around means that you would be exposed to the elements much more than someone that lives in the suburbs and commutes everywhere by car. Being in a city also exposes people to hazards such as being sprayed by a car/bike driving past a huge puddle, wind tunnels, etc. Outdoor apparel, while a little overkill, handles these niggles much better than "fashion" apparel.   This is why I feel that they are getting more and more popular.
text:I have to agree. I'm just entering middle age, and when I moved to a mid-size city in northern Italy several years ago I shifted from taking the metro in my old city to mainly commuting by bike (I live at the edge of the city and the public transportation is lackluster, but I insist on not driving a car because going downtown by car is stupid and totally not cost and time effective, at least here), and this forced me to change my clothing a bit: I started to wear more soft shell jackets in the winter (water repellent, easy to clean, light and more breathable than hard shells), I wore less fancy coats, I gave away the random cool sneakers in favour of approach shoes with vibram soles (my new sneakers, much more durable and better for the feet, mostly Scarpa and La Sportiva), and in the past 3/4 years I have started to acquire better pants/jeans (mainly Outlier and Duer, but I'm interested in other brands). Biking makes you sweat, especially in super humid northern Italy, and you need breathable, practical and durable clothing that's more effective at making you feel better on and off the bike. I'm very interested in tech clothing but I also started to wear more wool sweaters (easily available at the flea market here, 100% wool sweaters from 30 years ago for 20 euros are common) and better quality, handmade resolable shoes.   I am not a fan of down jackets (everyone wears them in Italy as soon as it's below 15c and i don't want to look like a local) and I still like the tech to look subtle (I mostly wear navy or dark clothing, but in my case it's a combination of commuting by bike and wanting to wear better gear that made my style evolve. My clothing style hasn't changed that much compared to 10 years ago, but I wouldn't buy H&M jeans, skate shoes and a low quality coat nowadays.	labels:	episode_done:True

I think my mom just didn't know what to do because she never had someone do it for her. When I got a bit older (and less hormonal), we started watching fashion TV shows and learned tips and tricks together. We would go shopping on the weekends and pick out new things, and sometimes we would trade out shoes or sweaters because we were close to the same size.   Now we live super far apart, and I forgot how much I missed that. I need to call my mom.
text:My parents were both scientists, and  tried to act like how women looked didn't matter.

text:What to do when nothing fits you properly?	labels:I’m an inch shorter than you and weight the exact same and I’d also describe myself as pear shaped so I’m guessing we look similar. My main problems have always been pants due to my height and shape: they’re too tight in the thigh, too short, or if they are a good length and fit my thighs, the waist is baggy. A few tips I’ve picked up at 24: You are now an adult, with an adults body so clothes from shops geared towards teens are going to fit weird. This is because they weren’t designed for your body not because your body is weird. (Young teens who shop there are often still in children’s sizes or are just barely out of them so the sizing is going to skew really small), if you are shopping there, don’t panic if you can’t fit into the size you think you are. The clothes are essentially made for kids.  At stores geared towards young adult women its easier to find pants that are labeled “curvy” which are not the same as “plus-sized.” it usually means the waist is cut smaller proportionally to the hip/thigh area, which is what you’re going to want to look for.  Look for pants that have longer inseams. Sometimes this will be labeled as “tall” I did not think i was tall enough to buy “tall” pants but pants that are meant to hit at the ankle always hit at my mid calf. Sometimes they are a little long but i think cuffed pants are cute so idc.	episode_done:True
text:2020 Wardrobe Data Analysis	labels:I think most people would be surprised at how few times they rewear their clothes!  I used to track my outfits every day in Stylebook but I’ve fallen off that with not getting dressed/WFH. Regardless, all of my most worn items are shoes, coats, and jeans. The only things that have hit the 30 wears mark are 1) my reflective puffer jacket (daily wear to walk dog), 2) winter office slippers (this is a little skewed because I wore these every day Jan-March in office, as a second pair of shoes), 3&4) winter boots, and 5) faded black boyfriend jeans.   I think if I had logged the stuff I wore better, it’d still be jeans/linen pants and shoes for the warmer months as well! Also all my practical stuff like beanies, sweatpants, house clothes that I usually don’t bother to log.   I like looking at cost per wear for fun. My boyfriend jeans are down to 15 cents per wear. My birks are down to 40 cents per wear which is solid for $100 shoes! I don’t take any of it seriously though. I have a bunch of basics that I like now, so I’m trying to buy more statement pieces that probably won’t be used nearly as much, but make me happy.

text:What do you get tailored?	labels:I love the idea of tailoring in theory, but in practice my body changes shape a lot. In the past I've struggles with an eating disorder, and had periods of fairly rapid weight loss and gain. These days I've been doing better with that, but I've also finally come out as non-binary. Some days I wear a chest binder and some days I don't. If I tailored things, I'd need a whole lot more clothing lol.   I expect there are people out there whose bodies change a lot even without these factors being involved. If anyone has tips for improving fit without actually stitching anything, or just wants to comiserate about the difficulties of an evolving body (whatever the source of those body changes), I'm here for it.
text:Makes sense - tailoring is probably better suited to some people (like me) who stay roughly the same size most of the time.  Not really tailoring advice, but when I was losing weight a few years ago I wore clothes with a lot of stretch which were a lot more accommodating to fit at different sizes.	labels:I do love a good elastic waistband :)	episode_done:True
text:People who built your wardrobe consciously from scratch - what were your strategies?	labels:I developed a few "uniform" looks with shapes that I decided work for me, and accumulated a lot of colors and prints and cuts of the same look. I have wide shoulders and narrow hips, and decided I wanted to play that up sometimes, and balance it out at other times. These are pretty generic categories and they're relatively "seasonless" (each season there are new pieces with their own spin on cuts and embellishments).  &#x200B;  * "Play up" style: oversized tops, lean trousers or jeans    * Silk tops (I have \~10 of these) - long sleeve and tee sleeve. Neutrals and loud prints    * Structured t-shirts    * Oversized sweaters and sweatshirts    * Blazers    * Skinny jeans and trousers in neutrals and darks    * Pencil skirts * "Balance" style:    * Sleeveless, tight tops - especially turtlenecks    * Form-fitting sweaters    * Paperbag pants; a- line skirts    * Sheath dresses    * Big belts * Sometimes I mix/match between my two silhouette groups, but I usually stay coherent within them, following the rule that half my look should be tight and the other half loose.  &#x200B;  That's shape. For color, I did some research and decided on colors that I know are all in one generally cohesive color story. As a light warm olive, I wear a lot of cream, navy, petrol blue, royal blue, rust orange, olive and dark green, warm pink/rose, and burgundy, with a smattering of other bright colors for specific outfits (but all my loud pants can be toned down with a cream top). I also rock the monotone grey/black.  * My colors are chosen to pair with each other and I'm relatively unadventurous with color to improve my pairing chances. * I might invest in multiple pieces in a single color in a season to improve chance of match * I often do neutral or monotone sets in color to bring attention to loud accessories.  Cohesiveness is more about what you don't have than what you have. I exclude categories that just don't make sense for my lifestyle, even when they are popular: corset tops, hoodie sets, complicated lace (although I \*love\* lace, I have no idea where I'd wear it), plunging v-necks, bright pink, "sexy" black clubwear, plaid, poofy maxi tutus, grandma cardigans, short skirts, shorts. I have some rather oddball pieces in these categories from gifts, clothing exchanges with friends, or 2005, and they hang in my "costume closet". When my style changes, I have that extra resource available to raid and try a style before committing.  To evaluate my wardrobe regularly, I bring clothes into a shortlist "rotation" and think about what pieces I use out of it and what I struggle to use. Anything I use a lot and wish I had a backup of, I might buy a second, related piece. Anything that sort of does the job it's supposed to do, but sort of fails at it, I might take a note of for an upgrade later, but 80% good is good enough.  * Eg - It turns out that however many plain cream tops I have, I always want more, so I've accepted that my wardrobe should have 5-10 good cream colored tops of all styles and embellishments. They all get worn and worn out. * On the other hand, I find it hard to make use of any black t-shirts, so black is just not a very good basic for me right now. * I have a big cream cardigan/jacket that is sort of good enough for its job - large, light-colored, classy outerwear - but sort of not. So noticing that over 10-20 wears has helped me identify the gap and know I can search opportunistically when I shop vintage, thrift, etc.

My 2020  strategy is a mix of eBay, Poshmark, and clearance sales  - as long as you search “blouse” and not “pajama”, prices are great. Reformation silks are currently $50-70, for example.	episode_done:True
text:People with an over the top personal style, how do you incorporate it into your day to day?	labels:I love flashy in a different way than you described.   I bought tie-dye crocs this spring and wear them with anything that’s not bold. Gray sundress, black baggy dress, all denim etc.   I’m really in love with orange and yellows and bought masks and bags to wear with these outfits.  I do have a silver sparkly pair of pants that I haven’t worn bc mainly it’s been hot. I would pair It with a colored shirt and black shoes. If I do wear that this winter, I will probably do black boots, a denim shirt, or red shirt.   I like playing with unique shapes since I’m a size 14/16 and got boxy body with a belly.	episode_done:True

This subreddit feels a lot like a small subreddit now! Has men's fashion just like.. fallen out of interest? Not that I'm really complaining, this subreddit is a lot friendlier and less circlejerky now that it's so much smaller. Just curious if anyone has any insight into why it's become such a seemingly small community.

text:Is fast fashion really fast fashion if you get years of use out of the garments?	labels:Honestly I’ve wanted to ask the same question. A lot of my closet is “fast fashion” from like 7-8 years ago (I’m 26) and yet it has lasted me years and years. Even some of my thrifted stuff originally from fast fashion brands has lasted quite a while due to the synthetic materials used that are basically indestructible.	episode_done:True

Luckily boots, sneakers and cute jackets are my weakness!
text:Also Seattle. Just want to add on that most of us never, ever use umbrellas.   And I agree about the waterproof shoes. I have a  couple of pairs of leather boots from outdoor companies.

text:Genrally down as long as you are using in dry conditions, it’s fine with some rain and wet snow but down does lose its insulation properties if it gets wet/soaked. Synthetics generally don’t perform quite as well in the warmth aspect but they will still keep some insulating properties when wet. Just a bit of trade off.	labels:Isn't the better insulation when wet more preferable? What happens if it rains or the place has high humidity? Isn't the Polyester more versatile? By the way, what is your opinion on DuPont Sorona?	episode_done:True
text:Dae get overwhelmed by fashion?	labels:I personally would minimize the tik tok and instagram use. I do follow some inspo on Instagram, but it walks a constant line between between being helpful and feeling bad. I tend to keep an eye out for what other people in real life wear, plus cross referenced with my own “aesthetic” of interest on tumblr. Pinterest can sometimes be useful, but only if you can feed it the right things.  A lot of actually wearing it comes down to exposure and practice. The more you try wearing things, the less it will feel like dress up. I wanted to get into hats this summer, and I felt sooo silly wearing one at first, but now I don’t and I get compliments on it. Wearing things in the house, then just to the store, then finally around people is a useful way of breaking things in mentally. I think the question is, what do you regret about colors? Or don’t like about jewelry? Is it something you can get around or genuinely not for you?
text:I guess the colors thing comes down to the fact that I don't like sticking out at all, so I stick to mostly black and grey. And I know this will sound weird, but to me jewelry takes away from my outfit instead of adds to it. I don't feel that way when I see other people wearing jewelry, but when I do they feel so distracting and I get really irritated.	labels:If you feel that way with jewelry, then less is more might just be your style. I get the feeling of wanting to look a certain way too, but in the end maybe it just isn't your style and you should embrace what you like . If you don't like jewelry, explore other things, like specific cool shoes, accessories like scarfs and bags, or low key but structured clothes etc.  Fx I remember loving twee and all things Zoe Deschanel 10 yrs ago, but it just looked awkward on me. So I finally understood how it was a look I could enjoy looking at, while my own style came out in other ways.	episode_done:True
text:What are a few items that you feel are essential when planning a wardrobe?	labels:IT depends on you.  What is your lifestyle (be realistic)?  When determining this, keep your area's climate in mind as well as your workplace (or school) dress code.  Also know your hobbies because a hiker is going to need vastly different attire than someone who likes clubbing.  IF your work environment is casual, then you don't need a closet full of business formal clothing.  If your workplace requires a uniform, then you don't need a wardrobe full of work clothes (unless the uniform is a dress code like black pants/white shirt).    If you're living in Miami, then you likely don't need a down parka.    That said, no matter your lifestyle, I'd have one outfit in your closet (could be the same thing or separates) to wear to a job interview, wedding (guest, not wedding party), and funeral.  Be prepared ahead of time should those occasions arise.    My other recommendation to learn color theory and the color seasons.   If you are unsure, try and find a celebrity that has similar coloring to you and study their wardrobe and what colors they wear on red carpets.  Know what colors look good on you and which ones do not.   I'm a clear winter, so my colors are jewel tones, icy pastels, and crisp colors.  Muted tones like olive, khaki, mustard, off white, etc look terrible on me.	episode_done:True
text:What is your ideal first date outfit?	labels:Could never go wrong with a black fitted top and cute fit jeans. Or black pants w the black fitted top. Shoes can be anything depending on where you’re going for the date from sneakers to loafers or stilettos. Black also.	episode_done:True
text:Is 2020 the year of the 'house dress?' On comfort as a 'trend'.	labels:I totally started looking up 1940s house dresses last summer because I wanted to bring it back for myself - something I could just throw on a day I was staying home, that was as comfortable as a night gown but sturdy enough to do yard work and look presentable if I wanted to run an errand or if someone walked over.  Something where I would feel no sense of commitment about putting something on (like an "outfit") and that would save "outfits" from getting dirty/worn, yet my body was covered for functional reasons, and looked presentable.  Since deciding I wanted this, I went on the hunt at my local Goodwill for the next month or so and here is what I ended up with:  1. A black t-shirt material tank top dress with black crochet at the top - feels like a nightgown, but if I actually decide to wear a regular bra with it, it's cute enough for a night out.  It's great for super hot days when I'd rather be naked.  I also use this as a nightie sometimes. 2. A floral t-shirt dress with short sleeves that has ruching on the sides by the thighs to make it a feminine shape - I actually bought this to be a nightgown, but it's so cute I have decided to wear it out a few times.  For years I wore old ratty clothes to bed that I'd be embarrassed to be seen in - this was a way for me to "sneak" things that should have been tossed in the rag bin back into my dresser, and it always made me feel freaked out if I needed to put my garbage out or something once I'd changed for bed.  I banished all that stuff and bought a few cute pajama sets and this dress, the one above, as well as another nighty that's more of a slip dress that's cute, but more slinky.  I love this t-shirt dress because it's really a casual dress for being out and about, so it's like having an extra item in my wardrobe, but it's a super soft nightgown the rest of the time.  Bonus - I never feel worried about someone seeing me in my jammies, because they are presentable (my husband really loves the banishment of the ratty old sleepwear as well). 3. A faded chambray sleeveless button-down shirt dress.  This is my heavy-duty day dress - the material is a little stronger, and I don't mind getting it dirty, so this is what I use for outdoor work, gardening, deep cleaning inside, etc.  It's presentable enough I wear it to put out garbage or dash over to the corner store for milk, but I don't mind if it gets muddy or stained a bit.  (this is the only one I don't really wear out other places, but it could do in a pinch).  I love not getting a whole outfit dirty when I'm doing something more involved.  So I started this day dress thing before social distancing as a way to be insanely lazy on my days off from work and to be covered without having to "get dressed," but it's really come in handy in 2020!    The nice thing about today's "house dresses" is that things like tshirt dresses and sack dresses are trendy and cute and can totally be worn as fashionable clothes outside the house (I'm thinking of women who wear chic sack dresses with booties), they just happen to also be insanely comfortable.  The floral dress I could even get away with wearing to work with tights or soft leggings underneath.  In some ways, we have it awesome in this day and age - I can literally get away with wearing an insanely comfy nightgown (the dress I bought to use as a nightgown) to work and look dressed up, and we can literally wear blankets to work in winter and look good doing it (hellooooo blanket scarves!).  I can also wear my Prana Halle pants that are flattering and capable of doing anything from hiking to carpentry in (even passing as business casual dress pants), when I feel like wearing pants instead.  I feel like i have a lot of options for comfort, style, versatility, and functionality.	episode_done:True

text:Fashion to help your changing body and lifestyle?	labels:Not really answering the question, but my issue has been the opposite. I'm about 10lbs lighter now than I was in high school, and I've stayed short and tiny my whole life. I basically kept my high school wardrobe all through college, then packed it with me when my husband and I got married and I moved. I didn't see the issue and thought it was ludicrous to get rid of an entire closet of clothes that were still intact and fit me well, until I started getting more serious about my career as a professor and realized my "professional teaching clothes" still read as "student attending an award ceremony."  Starting over the summer, I began weeding through my closet and donating anything that didn't make me happy or I couldn't imagine myself wearing in front of a classroom of college students or colleagues (except for my loungewear and workout clothes.) I felt A LOT of guilt at first, because I realized how many pieces I held onto for the nostalgia or just because they fit. I had to invite one of my closest friends over to help me make the tough decisions and she didn't let me talk myself into keeping a piece I initially put in the donate pile. That really helped my perspective, and now I can make more objective decisions without needing a cheerleader.   Once I got rid of about half of my closet (spring/summer and fall/winter wardrobe combined,) I gave myself permission to buy a few higher-end pieces that are much more my style but also fit both my daily life and professional needs. Neutral colors and versatile silhouettes. I feel so much less stress and guilt when I open my closet now, it really feels like I've moved into a new chapter of myself. It's my dream to have a 10-15 piece capsule closet, but one step at a time.  I'm so sorry I just went on a big tangent. It's been an enlightening quarantine for me obviously lol.	episode_done:True
text:What’s your favorite winter fashion staple?	labels:Lace trimmed camisoles under V neck sweaters, warm tights, and realizing that if you arent using public transportation you arent usually outside and trying to look cute for more than 5 minutes at a time. I stopped doing a lot of layering and just got a couple of coats for the various weather to put over things I like to wear inside. Being sweaty inside your coat is the worst.   Dressing to wait for the bus/train is a different story.
text:Can you recommend some lace trimmed camis that you like? I have been looking for some lately but struggling to find camis that are delicate but still professional work environment appropriate. The only ones I’m finding are a little too lingerie-ish.	labels:I usually cheat and wear a cropped lace modesty panel thing from Amazon unless the sweater is itchy. Something like [these](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07QQRSZ7Y/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_uuENFbRA5GMJQ). Soma used to sell bras with lace panel too to cover cleavage. Its definitely hard to find the high cut ones! If you want a little Edwardian glam search for "lace high neck dickie".

text:I know “fashion” but people of minorities are always forced to try better. Some Insights	labels:How is any of this about racism?  They got 5 black guys and dressed them lazy (sports outfit), comfy (Sweats) and business casual (shirt and trousers). Then they got rated by a predominantly white, female audience who saw one series of pictures.  All that study tells me/us is that wearing business casual makes you look more capable and trustworthy (DUH), sweats make you look less capable and a sports uniform makes you look even less capable.  Did they compare it to a white or nb POC Group? Not mentioned.  So it is racist because white women think (black) men in chinos are more intelligent then men in soccer uniforms? Same goes for white/yellow/red/blue guys. There is a reason why a suit is worn on important occasions.  And then social science is angry if STEM people laugh about them somehow.  Additional:  Original study has 4 black guys. Article talks about 5. 143 participants vs 145.  Study: Models wearing formal clothing or winning clothing were also rated  significantly higher than models wearing swagger clothing on several  traits.  Article: Contrary to the researchers’ expectations, the men in sweatpants were  generally rated more positively than the men in soccer uniforms.  **WHAT?**  Did the journal author even read the Abstract?  &#x200B;  Conclusion in the linked abstract:  >Participant’s Symbolic Racism Score significantly affected their ratings  of models. Results suggest that the clothing that an African American  wears, as well as viewer prejudice, affects the impression that the  viewer makes.  &#x200B;  >Results suggest that the clothing that an African American  wears,\[...\] affects the impression that the  viewer makes.  Not about racism. Same goes for every human being.  &#x200B;  >Participant’s Symbolic Racism Score significantly affected their ratings  of models.  That one is about racial prejudice - so racism? I dont know enough about the current US view of racism to comment. But my next question would be an analysis of the Racism Score. Did they differ by a point or two? Or was it MLK vs KKK?  &#x200B;  tl:dr Shitty article about a mostly irrelevant study even the writer of psypost didnt bother to read. Authors conclusion is wrong if it wants to be based on this study.

text:What are some differences between stereotypical Millennial and Gen Z fashion/aesthetics?	labels:Ooh I LOVE this topic and I love zoomers making fun of Millennials. I worked in retail at a trendy shop with a lot of Zoomer customers, so here are some of my thoughts.   I can't articulate it exactly but here are some thoughts. Zoomers have a cool 90s vibe, their tops are either very baggy T shirts or very tight and strappy little camis. They might even wear tight little polos, which are anathema to a lot of Millennials. But either way they are definitely not wearing the "flowy" or "body skimming" blouses that are Millennial staples. Kind of similarly, Zoomers aren't wearing long open cardigans. If it's a cardigan, it's cropped, tight, and button up .. but they don't seem to go for cardigans in general.    As for bottoms, a lot of Millennials are still into skinny jeans! I really don't think trendy zoomers are wearing that silhouette at all. Another Milennial hallmark is ankle boots. Zoomers are not wearing those cute little black Chelseas. They are wearing either super funky platform boots or skate sneakers. Zoomer makeup trends are different - more blush, a younger and more dewy look.    Part of this is due to age and life stage - zoomers aren't needing as much office wear yet, and they are at a younger and sexier and more experimental age.
text:[deleted]	labels:Just curious, why do you hate them? Is it the look on their own or that they don't work with your outfits or something else?  Personally I always found it hard to make Chelsea boots work with my style/body, but I pretty much live in combat boots in the fall/winter.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else feel that nothing is unfashionable nowadays?	labels:I’ve kind of been feeling this too, but I wonder how much is just me getting older and caring less whether other people like my outfit and more just if I do. We’re also in the midst of a silhouette flip from tight bottom, loose top, to loose bottom, tight top. That means people are wearing both right now and it feels like you can get away with more. (People may say we’ve already made the flip, but those people live in more fashionable cities than I do 😛)  Length is still defining though - most pants are still cropped. Long tops are hard to find and tucking tops in some way is still the norm. These little things make a big difference over a decade. If I style early 2000s jeans and t shirt, I’d wear a really long shirt with low rise pants that go all the way to meet my shoes and I wouldn’t have to think about what socks I’m wearing. If I put on a late 2010s version, I’d do high rise cropped straight leg, make sure I have no show socks and I’d tuck the front of my boxy T-shirt.  All that said, I do feel like you can get away with a lot and still look like you’re making a fashionable choice if you have enough confidence and your hair and makeup are current.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 05, 2020	labels:Could anyone find a jacket like this? https://www.justamericanjackets.com/product/women-suede-shearling-jacket/  Same style, same material, but in grey? And just grey on the base, i want the lining to still be black. I know the site says women's but this is a dope jacket and if I could get it in a grey that's be great. I'm willing to go up to $600
text:You’re not going to find suede + shearling for $600. The website you linked is hella dropshippy and sketch so I would avoid it.   Saint Laurent would definitely do something like that, but it would be a lot more than $600.	labels:I might save up some more then, honestly I could drop $1000, pay off in installments and not really feel it too much after a check or two, but I just got my bank account back up so maybe after Christmas.

text:What did people *actually* wear in 2000's?	labels:Well most cycles of fashion is a new take on an era, not an exact replica, so authentic 2000s wouldn’t be in style, but a 2020 take on it would.   I was in college and we wore low rise flares and tight fitting long tops. I mean, we wanted to look like we had the longest torso and lowest butt ever!!! It was a time to be alive. We wore shiny shit to the clubs and our moms told us not to look like we were wearing our jammies because it was all lingerie-looking.   We lived for a layered look but a fuckin stupid one, like a cami over a t shirt. Or a scarf with a tank top.  I even wore a skirt over JEANS and they were flared wtf.
text:Jean shorts over leggings is making a comeback and honestly I’m here for it.	labels:I did skirts over jeans all the time but never got to do the shorts over leggings or tights.

text:Truly, I never understood what people were talking about when they said they rarely washed their jeans. I was so used to jeans from like Gap, where the knees and waist would stretch and bag out by the end of the day and I’d feel the need to wash them after every use to get them back in shape.

text:Do you have any tips for finding these? I get so overwhelmed shopping at goodwill and never find the pieces that are actually valuable.	labels:Older "made in Scotland" cashmere sweaters are what I look for. The tags are usually obviously old. The cuffs are often longer. A small mens' is OK by me (often in centimeters - 40 cms works for me - am US 8).  If you find an *old* John Laing, grab it.	episode_done:True
text:What’s your opinion on (modern) 90s-inspired fashion?	labels:In the 90s, I was in highschool (94-98) and university (98-02). This 90s-inspired fashion trend is my jam. I've never really moved far from my teenage aesthetics.  After 20 years, I'm finally on trend again! Quick! Everybody throw on your hypercolor tees!
text:Yessss, same!  But it's tough for this generation to understand the idea of subcultures now...like, yes, all those things were 'popular' but among different groups with different interests and different musical soundtracks. And the weird stuff, the clothing that looks totally normal now, was hard to find!!  To be fair, so was the music.	labels:I think there are still subcultures now though, but it's easier to learn about them, so they aren't as mysterious.	episode_done:True

text:Can’t believe I’m saying this to the master of zany, but I think you could’ve gone for some crazier shoes here. Maybe those backless ones with the ripple sole, or some... square toed loafers perhaps?	labels:I dig what you’re saying! I think the sneakers do make it a little more typical than I’m used to.   For once I was actually dressing for comfort but believe me when I finally receive the Martine Rose loafers from SSENSE (which are currently 10 days in to an estimated 30 day shipping wait time) I’ll be wearing them to death.	episode_done:True
text:What are some habits that keep clothes/shoes new vs that habits that ruin them?	labels:I like everything in this list. My top one is to avoid dryers except for garments I don't really care for. Functionally this means I have three categories of clothes:  * 1/ "Basics" including underwear, socks, and some pajamas/tees: **beat up**    * These are worn til dirty, usually 1 day, washed, and sometimes dried in dryer on low (all underwear in mesh bags and some of it is hung to dry)    * Old gear that's worn out is also in this category and used for chores, gardening, etc    * I buy these from Uniqlo, Everlane, etc for ideally <$20 and plan for them to wear out after ~30-50 wash cycles (2-3 years) * 2/ Athleisure and workout clothes that I want to keep in good condition: **hang dry**    * Worn for workout and immediately tossed into hamper to wash on cold, hang to dry. I will turn these inside out and put them into a mesh bag if delicate    * I really like nice workout gear so I may splurge $100 for a piece - eg a nice biking jersey or yoga leggings  * 3/ Fashion pieces: **avoid laundering**    * These may be silk, leather, bonded cotton, wool, etc and include anything luxury but also anything weird and intricate    * I wear these "out" for work or outings or special events, do not wear them when lounging, and try to take them off once I get home. I avoid sweat in these if at all possible.    * I spray these with tea tree and lavender (antimicrobial) to disinfect, steam to release wrinkles, and wash or dry clean if they smell but only if so. Dry cleaning also wrecks clothes and you can assume they will last in “pristine” condition only 10-15 cycles.  I'm a huge fan of athleisure because it's reduced the fussiness of my life by replacing some of category (3) with category (2). I actually don't shop too much but wearing silk regularly, and living in a high COL area, means my dry cleaning bill is typically $1,000+ a year (not 2020 obviously). Fashion is expensive!
text:[The Laundress](https://www.thelaundress.com/clean-collective-loyalty-program/) is apparently safe to use for dry clean only items. Tracey Ellis Ross did a video on this. They have specific products to cold hand wash silks, cashmere, athleticwear, etc. They have sales often and lots of information on their site so definitely worth checking out. Hopefully that helps with your dry cleaning bill.   Great points btw. Will try breaking stuff into categories.	labels:Thank you! I will check out the Laundress soaps - great tip.	episode_done:True

Now that I’m an adult and making decent money I’ve actually purchased a few of these items second hand on Vestiaire Collective or Vinted. The top two are an Alexander McQueen silk skull print scarf and a Mulberry Alexa bag.

PS for the upcoming year... I will need to know how to style this one.
text:I love linen! I have a wide array of linen clothes - dresses, tops, skirts, pants...but I struggle to look out together when I wear them. I think it comes down to confidence and the way you care for the fabric... I’ve nailed the confidence part but I’m still experimenting	labels:I bought them with the thoughts that the linen blazer could be used for business (mostly industry meetings and expos) as well as a nice little coat to wear with jeans (or maybe even summer shorts!) casually, and same concept with the pants.  I'm trying to decide if wearing them together is too much? I think a businessy white tank would do well, but my imagination is not going beyond that!	episode_done:True
text:Can we talk sleepwear?	labels:I have a vintage Natori nightgown and robe (ankle length nightgown, floor length robe but I’m short) set that I love for sleeping and puttering - nylon or polyester silk-feel with a rich print, machine washable but soooooo classic, strong effortlessly tousled 70s house wife vibes. Search for nightgown and robe or peignoir set - there are a million vintage sets in all different styles and price points so it doesn’t have to be a big commitment if it turns out to not be for you. And even vintage synthetics, if they’re not dry rotted or sun rotted, launder beautifully and don’t need babying.  The super strappy nightgown means it’s great for when it’s hot, and the long sleeve full length robe in a synthetic fabric makes it actually warm enough to drink coffee on the deck in the spring. And I feel totally covered but low key sexy if I need to check the mail or something.  Fit is key for any slippery fabric, especially as a person that feels claustrophobic the second my clothes get tangled or too tight in just one spot. For anything silky you want it to fit just like a slip (see my previous ancient comments singing the praises of slips). It should be loose enough that it glides over your body when you move and not ride up on your hips, but fitted enough that it wouldn’t bunch up under a skirt or sweater.   Sometimes a boob does escape if I’m tossing and turning but honestly I could stop it from happening if I took the time to shorten the straps exactly to fit me or it it had a different configuration.	episode_done:True

text:That’s awesome, I love it. I bought a stupid expensive tie die sweatshirt at the beginning of quarantine and I wear it at least once a week. I don’t care if it is a trend that will be gone soon, I have worn the shit out of it and it makes me happy. I say do it.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Let's talk the impact of fragrance on perception of style! How much does a person's fragrance affect your impression of them? Do you choose perfume with this in mind? What are some of your favourites?	labels:I’m going to be alone in this as always, but fragrances are kind of a pet peeve of mine as I have a sensitive nose and am allergic. Social distancing is wonderful for me, but even better would be for it to be socially acceptable to ask people not to wear perfume, because a few meters is really not enough. If you want to wear fragrance you can just wear natural materials as wool and leather have nice warm and earthy smells. People also generally smell nice with nothing on, and what fragrance could be more personal than that?
text:Not alone! While I do love some smells like fruity and woody combinations, i dislike many more and find it almost offensive if someone uses a lot of perfume. Why would you assume everyone must love your scent and must be forced to inhale it all day long in an office. Same as people in parks who blast their music for everyone to hear - if our tastes match I will be glad, but chances are they won’t. I see it as invasion of my sense space.   I love my natural smell. I looooove how I smell after exercise and I go around my house sniffing my armpits for the rest of the day. But should I put it in the face of my coworkers just because I love it so much? No. So keep your perfumes such that they don’t leave clouds of smell.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What are your favorite fashionable winter jackets?	labels:I would start by figuring out what your primary use for the coat would be. For example if you are using it for transit outside you might want something that is waterproof.   I would also suggest looking at the material/fabric content of the coats your are interested in. Wool and cashmere are very nice but you might need to have it dry cleaned vs just tossing it in a wash cycle. So it’s important to figure out what makes more sense for your day to day.   My area usually gets pretty cold in the winters and I love my [LL Bean Coat](https://m.llbean.com/llb/shop/62463?page=women-s-classic-lambswool-polo-coat-three-quarter&bc=12-27-610-504728&feat=504728-GN2&csp=f&pos=4) for extra cold days but I use it for a more professional setting. I’m usually a size 2 but sized up for an oversized look that I can layer under.

text:Good Cheap Stuff Appreciation	labels:**Shirts**
text:I suppose it depends what your definition of _cheap_ is. Under $5? $10? $15?  My favourite white t-shirt is the [Uniqlo U Crew Neck Short-Sleeve T-Shirt](https://www.uniqlo.com/us/en/u-crew-neck-short-sleeve-t-shirt-422992.html?dwvar_422992_color=COL00&cgid=men-UniqloU-t-shirts-and-sweats#start=1&cgid=men-UniqloU-t-shirts-and-sweats). It's 99 DKK here which IMO is cheap for a t-shirt. Looks like they're $14.99 in the US.  The t-shirt has a slightly oversize, boxy fit and is made of stiff heavy cotton. It holds a nice shape that I find flattering compared to softer shirts that drape in all the wrong ways (hello perky tits).  - Wear it as-is for a boxy/oversize look. - Cuff the sleeves for a more fitted look. The material is sturdy and the cuffs will hold even through the wash. - Tuck it in for a 1950s James Dean-style fit.  So many shirts suffer from weird proportions - fitted body with super-side sleeves that flap around. Tight in the chest but flared at the waist so they look like a dress. Not these. They're legitimately my favourite white t-shirt.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 09, 2020	labels:Hi everyone, looking to source some thoughts on sneakers. The TL;DR is that I'm looking for a white or off-white sneaker that's in the **style** of a runner, but I'll be wearing it as a lifestyle shoe, I (most likely) will not be actually running in it. The back and forth I'm having in my mind is wondering if I should actually get something that skews towards performance because there's still benefits to that for casual use (traction, support, durability), or if I should just get a pure fashion silhouette.  The models I'm considering, and some of my thoughts on each:  [Adidas x OAMC Type O-5](https://media.endclothing.com/media/f_auto,q_auto:eco/prodmedia/media/catalog/product/1/5/15-07-20_FV7127_m1_1.jpg) is the fashion silhouette I'm most considering. The biggest question mark on these is that I can't find basically ANY reviews of them online, for all I know they maybe have okay traction, support, etc. but I don't have any way to really know until I get them in hand. Materials on the collab are well reviewed in other silhouettes though, and adiprene as a cushion is well-regarded too. Design wise, I like them a lot too, which is obviously key to a fashion silhouette.  [Hoka One One Clifton Leather](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0994/1960/products/2901-HOKA_BOND_CLIF-2266_1024x.jpg?v=1593560293) is one of the more "performance" models I'm considering. This particular variant on the Clifton is meant to skew a little towards lifestyle rather than being a top tech performer but the overall deign is still firmly in the brand's performance roots. Pretty chunky, very much in the "dad shoe" vibe, the toebox especially really reminiscent of Nike Air Monarchs. Performance but not too "try hard," but maybe leaning towards looking "orthopedic." Is "grampa sneaker" a category yet?  [Salomon runners](https://media.endclothing.com/media/f_auto,w_600,h_600/prodmedia/media/catalog/product/2/9/29-09-2020_blr_412643_1.jpg) are the most explicitly performance-forward tech shoes, though, I don't have a single particular model I'm after. Most tech packed of everything I'm considering and it shows in the design, they aren't exactly brutalist but they're utilitarian in a sense, they're not trying to mask their purpose at all, and in fact, are perhaps designed to highlight it. I know a lot of people who absolutely swear by Salomon as their daily-wear sneakers, too. I find myself waffling on whether or not I like the way they look, there's something appealing about the matter-of-fact-ness to them. That said, I don't know if wearing them (mostly) casually threatens to look weird, in a way that it looks kind of weird to wear performance basketball models (Kyries, Lebrons, the most recent Jordans, etc.) casually.  Price wise we're looking around the same numbers for all of them, the OAMCs I can get for $165 on sale right now, and it's *plausible* they'll dip a hair lower, the Hokas are $150 MSRP and will probably be pretty easy to get discounted, and Salomon shoes are mostly in this territory as well, depending on the model.  Thoughts?  I'm open to other suggestions too.
text:They've all got very different profiles.   It'll really depend on how you normally dress.   Wider fits the Hoka chunk is the best bet.  Techwear/athliesure the Solomons.

text:Have you ever participated in a clothing swap - in person or online?	labels:In the Before Times I would host one or two per year--I would make a facebook event and invite maybe 20 people (and just text friends who didn't have social media) and I'd usually get around 10 folks that showed up. I usually served mimosas and encouraged people to bring hors d'oeuvres so that it was also a little brunch gathering too. Some of the pieces I got from those have given me the most mileage over the years, and often they're items I never would have thought to look for!   I don't know if I'd do the digital ones, feels more like thrifting given the shipping cost and these days I prefer to buy secondhand via poshmark and whatnot since I am better able to find exactly what I'm looking for. Personally I'd be comfortable right now with an in person swap that takes place entirely outside (with mask required to use the bathroom) with a very small group of people I know, but I don't want to put pressure to do that on anyone else so I've just donated my clean-out clothes. Plus half the fun is trying something on and having your friends help you decide to keep it or leave it, and I don't know how I'd make that work outdoors. God I miss pre-2020...

But for me, I have noticed a difference in the material from other cheaper leggings (could just be placebo). I love how the fabrics of these bougie pieces feel and since they're nicer quality workout clothes, I'm even able to wear nearly all of my pieces to work and feel cozy and comfy (and even better, BE ABLE TO FOCUS). I'm not itching to pull the pieces off when I get home like I did with other clothes. I also take better care of these clothes because I did pay lots of money for them, so I actually follow washing and drying recommendations to maintain the fabric quality.

text:Post-Baby Problems I Wish Someone Had Warned Me About	labels:Yes. Mom of 2, youngest is 6.  I have some other commentary (based on things I have told myself):  Regarding pre-baby clothes : throw them out (or donate). You don’t want to wear them. They are old. They will not make you feel good in your new body. You are older. You are a different person. Buy some new clothes that make you feel great because they fit. Move on with your life.   Ignore the number on the label. It means nothing. Find a good tailor - remember, you’re older now. You can get things tailored. You don’t need to buy Forever 21 anymore. And once the babies are in preschool and you’re not paying childcare anymore, you’ll have plenty of disposable income 🥴  Once the babes are done nursing, BUY NEW BRAS you will feel like a new woman.

I personally would have saved myself a lot of misery by accepting sooner that I was different, fundamentally changed, bodily and emotionally, after I had children. Perhaps your vintage dresses played to a more sophisticated, aged, experienced you - but my [2 sizes too small] pencil skirts did not work for my new me.   I am now a middle aged woman with elementary aged children. I am telling myself that I am choosing different fashions than the fast fashion of F21. Those choices usually cost more. And if they don’t, they usually don’t fit me well - spending an extra $20 on a $30 piece makes me feel better wearing that item.

text:Mario Valentino is not Valentino Garavani	labels:SAY IT LOUDER PLZ	episode_done:True
text:What do YOU do with "chub rub" jeans?	labels:So, I'm a personal stylist that specializes in fitting women's denim. In my experience, the useable lifespan of a pair of jeans is about 2 years. Some will hold up longer than that (usually the higher the cotton amount, the longer they will last), but when you're talking middle-of-the-road quality with blended fabric, the two year mark is where you'll start to see warping, color fade, stress on the hardware, but most tragically, crotch breakdown. And this is across the board for women of all shapes and sizes. It's just that the area is subject to constant friction but a lot of my clients worry that it's due to their shape. It's not.  As I mentioned above, probably the best defense is shopping for denim that has a higher cotton percentage, like 98% or more. I have two pairs of 100% cotton vintage Levi's that are 35 and 25 years old respectively with no crotch wear. The caveat is the more cotton content, the less your jeans will stretch. They will mold to your body... but they will not stretch. And you're limited in styles. There aren't really any 100% cotton skinny jeans, at least none that work well for most people so you're kind of limited to that mom/boyfriend/straight style fit.  The second thing you can do is be gentle in caring for your jeans. There are some diehards who never wash their denim. This is a little silly when you're talking non-raw or non-selvedge denim. Please wash your jeans. But I recommend getting a gentle detergent (woolite), do not use fabric softener (actually you shouldn't use it period), wash on cold, gentle cycle inside out, and hang to dry. This is especially important if you are dealing with blended fabric since the stretch fibers will break down when exposed to heat. I recommend washing every 5 or so wears. If you need to freshen up between washes you can toss them in the dryer on low with a handful of ice cubes and a dryer sheet for 15 minutes or until the ice stops rattling. This shouldn't be too damaging since you're not drying saturated fabric for 45+ minutes but it will reset the shape (especially for stretch jeans that are starting to warp and/or sag) and knock out any smell.  For repair, the sooner you address a hole the better. You may be able to self-patch up a hole that's smaller than two fingers through it. If you're crafty, get out the sewing machine and sew what you can. A quick YouTube search will turn up tutorials that are better than anything I could attempt to describe here. You could also patch from the inside and sew everything closed with a little reinforcement. But if the surrounding fabric is starting to degrade or if the hole is big and/or in a conspicuous spot, you really only have one option other than retiring those jeans.  In terms of repair beyond two fingers, the best way to do it for a pair of jeans that you CANNOT bear to part with is to send them to be rewoven. I only know of [one company that does this well](https://www.denimrepair.com/) but it's not exactly cheap ($45 + shipping) so I would really evaluate any denim that you get re-woven. In 20 years I've only had 2 pairs re-woven. It also only really buys you a few more months with stretch denim, maybe a year or two with a higher cotton count. With blended denim, it may just be best to total them. Give them a viking funeral.  All in all, I think your best bet is to just sort of accept that most of your jeans will only last about 2 years. Oh, and when they stop fitting correctly, don't be so hard on yourselves. A lot of the time, jeans will stop fitting because their fabric is warping from being worn and washed. A good way to find jeans that fit is to look based on your height (which will tell you inseam and rise, first and foremost). Most women don't know what their height translates to in terms of those measurements though even though this is one of the biggest reason jeans "don't fit." [This has helped me sort out jeans that will fit in the length and rise for a client.](https://project-fit-mvp.herokuapp.com/) Then I just need to find something they'll like and select their size. It's not pretty but it does like 90% of my styling job by only showing stuff that's going to fit.
text:Women's jeans are generally terrible.  Most of them are not denim at all, but leggings that look like jeans.  Especially the skinny fits.  I've taken to buying men's jeans in the skinniest fit I can find.  They're often 98-99% cotton and fit fine.  They feel better, last longer AND THEY HAVE ACTUALLY USEFUL POCKETS.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 27, 2020	labels:Hi All:   This is probably a pretty standard question, so sorry if this is boring. I googled, but I'd like some of your thoughts as well.   I don't think I need to wash my clothes every time I wear them. For example, if I'm wearing and undershirt, I don't think the over shirt needs to get washed more than maybe once every 10 wears. For context, I have a pretty sedentary job so I'm not sweating a lot. So, first of all, is the wash once every 10 wears correct?   However, the clothes begin to smell a little stale. Not really bad (like not body odor) just a collection of odors that stick to it from daily life. How can I get rid of these odors without washing (since I think washing reduces the life, makes them less soft, fit not as well, messes up colors, etc.)? I've heard of freezing to kill bacteria and maybe 15 minutes in the dryer with a dryer sheet to give a fresh smell.   TL;DR: how to keep clothes fresh with out putting them in the washer machine.
text:I don’t think you can get 10 wears out of a shirt tbh. If it smells you should wash it, end of story in my book.  I normally wash tees and undergarments after every wear. Button ups I go for about 3(but I don’t wear undershirts), hoodies and sweatshirts around 10, pants are maybe once a month depending on how often I wore them	labels:	episode_done:True

text:A Basic Guide to Useful Knitwear	labels:controversial opinion  but am I the only one who has found knitwear to be more hassle than its worth? They pill easily, can't be hung and need to be stored properly, risk of losing its shape is high, and they can be pretty pricey.  An alternative I've found useful and maybe useful for others.. rather than wearing a sweater over your shirt.  wear one of those uniqlo heat tech under shirts under your shirt.  they have 3 levels of warmth and can get pretty warm. they are also cheap.
text:Better sweaters don't pill.  Wool sweaters don't lose their shape. No matter how attractive a cotton sweater is, I won't let myself buy one again because I'm always disappointed.  They don't go on hangers but that's ok. And wool is expensive but a miracle material.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:What are your thoughts on outfit repeating multiple days in a row?	labels:I think the pressure is to not be "strange/unaware of your appearance" or more likely not to look "poor/can't afford more clothes." Some people do notice, and the rude ones point it out. This perception starts young. Growing up, there were teachers and other school staff who repeated outfits and other children loudly pointed it out.  I repeat outfits as much as possible if I'm not seeing the same people (my household doesn't count). The internal pressure is strong to not repeat within a few weeks of seeing the same people to avoid potential comments.
text:Ah yes, strategizing when you wear which outfits because you want to wear an outfit multiple times but don't want to risk being seen wearing it twice. I loved the first two years of college for that reason- M/W an T/TR classes had entirely different sets up people. The outfit repeats were abundant.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Fashion to help your changing body and lifestyle?	labels:Are you me?!  Clothing is 100% the way I manage to feel even remotely confident in my body. I have by no means actually figured this out – especially since I gained weight during the pandemic AND had abdominal surgery (no more crop tops for now since I don’t care to explain the marks) this year – but these are my tips:  1) Get rid of stuff that doesn’t fit you. I’m not sure if what you’re describing with weight stabilizing in a stable relationship is eating-disordered behavior, but in my similar situation, it absolutely was. I am pretty triggered by things that don’t fit, especially across the bust, which leads to my next point...  2) Bra fitting changes everything. I love how you note your old style was “lots of boobs” because mine was too, but kind of by accident because I had ill-fitting bras, and, by transition, clothes. I cannot recommend r/abrathatfits enough because whether “lots of boobs” is still you or you want to transition from it, a well-fitted bra makes everything look more professional and makes everyone look incredible...and feel incredible, too!  3) Tailor to your favorite parts of you. So, I took this really radically and now make my clothes. But that’s not an option for everyone. What is, however, more of an option, is taking things in at the waist, getting things hemmed, and putting in darts (triangle folds) to better fit curves. Depending on where you live, these “operations” can cost like $9-20 only and make the biggest difference. I have stubby legs, a ridiculously short waist, and bras that work as hats, but in my clothes that actually fit me, you don’t see those traits so much as the total look...and I like that look! I think tailoring is the best way to make clothes work FOR you, not you have to work around the clothes.  I hope that helps!!	episode_done:True

I loved it. So much fashion! I was on a budget so I wanted to look like that but couldn’t. I found some designer stuff at goodwill though! Anyway, now I live in a rural town. I feel overdressed wearing a blouse, jeans, and makeup. It’s THAT dressed down. I’m on the lookout for ANY fashion and not many people even try around here.

She wore the hell out of it for about 5 years. She joked that she wanted to be buried in that suit. When she passed away unexpectedly, I brought the suit to the funeral home and she got her wish.

I hated my body, I was afraid of makeup, I wore sports bras so tight that they worked as binders, and I dressed as masculine as the wardrobe bought by my mother would allow.  There was definitely also a blend of dysmorphia or something else going on but the largest fashion statement I ever made was wearing my moms worn down, brown leather jacket.  I’m more comfortable with myself now and since moving out for college I’ve started marking myself consciously.  I let my hair grow out from the buzz cut and I picked clothing that’s bright, noisy, and fun. I can genuinely enjoy standing out but every now and again I have that uncomfortable fear from high school and disgust that crawls up. The feeling can make it hard to even pick an outfit because I want to hide my body without marking me as frumpy, or ugly, or messy.	episode_done:True

My higher end shoes are from Dune London and Cole Haan and they have extremely well.   And I know this isn't technically "fashion" but some people like it for the aesthetic - Chanel makeup is quite good.   I would love a Burberry coat one day! But my nice coat is Ted Baker which I would recommend.

text:Changing Your Habits: Deciding to Not Shop Brands for Ethical or Other Reasons & Following Through	labels:Yes, I am pretty good at holding a grudge. I definitely stop shopping some brands for various reasons: customer service issues, political, and ethical ones.   1. H&M is banned after one too many racist incidents. I have pretty much 100% avoided for 3 years now, though I did get some socks for my halloween costume out of desperation last year. But that was the first time I had even been in over that time period. 2. Bloomies in SF - they had terrible customer service (I probably got racial profiled). I avoided shopping there for like 5 or 6 or 7 years. Eventually I bought something in store because I got good service and they had a good price. I am still pretty wary and end up at other department stores, but that was off the list for a long time. And when I banned it, let's say that I walked by it like every day as part of my work commute so it was very very accessible to me. Also Longchamp (in SF) was also on the list for the same reasons, I avoided it for the same amount of time. One day I saw a really great bag, I planned to look and buy it online, but the sales rep was so great, that I purchased and even got a thank you note! (I also spent the better part of the that period walking by often). 3. I don't shop at Walmart because of the low pay, but I still shop at Target which is marginally better. 4. I am trying not to shop at Amazon as much as practical and shopping in person. I am also not going to Whole Foods as much because Amazon killed the original spirit of the store. They used to get way more of my dollars (and it is very conveniently located for me) but I am shopping other grocers instead.  As for my current priorities in shopping:  * more Black-owned brands in every category. In the past my decision making was more opportunistic, if I heard about a brand I went for it vs actively seeking them out. I am trying to convert my skin routine into 70% Black-owned! * More smaller businesses and smaller specialty retail * More made in the US items (this is pretty hard because quality is hard to discern and options in my size are limited) * more sustainable production habits - this is hard (sizing is a challenge here) and I also love Target clothes. I have been an avid Target shopper for ages and many of my faves come from there. Great for trends. And honestly things generally hold up just fine for me. I'll probably end up with a wardrobe that is 20% Target, 30% sustainably made, 30% from small businesses, and 20% higher end brands.  In my dreamworld I'd have an option like [McMullen](https://shopmcmullen.com) that has my size! This is a Black owned boutique (used to be in my neighborhood, but has now moved to another nearby one) that carries lots of Black-owned brands in edition to higher end stuff. And then another lower end, well curated boutique for staples.
text:I'm in SF too!!!! I literally just moved here a few months ago from Canada so all your points are especially topical to me. I'm excited to have Target, finally, for the same reasons you mentioned.  For some reason I think skincare would be the hardest for me to transition because I used to have terrible acne and I'm super cautious about changing brands. Have you found any winners you like? Are you doing it product by product?	labels:I am in Oakland! I worked in SF for many years, and supposedly I will work in downtown Oakland one day!   As for the skincare, it is product by product. I am a more is more routine kind of person. My skin really liked my modified Korean routine, and never looked better, so I have a lot of steps!   So far this [product](https://www.basebutter.com) is a winner for me! I am totally obsessed. I bought some late last year as a lighter moisturizer to pair with my sunscreen (ugh sunscreen is so hard). My skin is dry, but if I pick the wrong sunscreen and moisturizer combo I look oily. Anyway this is great, the only bad thing is that it keeps selling out. So now I have just been buying two when it goes back in stock! Each jar lasts me around 2 months or so. :D It is not heavy at all, and is designed for acne. I don't really have many issues with breakouts, but I wanted a gel moisturizer since I layer on so many other essences and the like, it works better to lighten up that layer.   Also this oil [cleanser](https://www.shopkaike.com/products/melt). I've got a few other things in the queue: I am investigating cleansers as Amy next category. But I have plenty and loads of samples to get through. Also thinking about a serum. I ordered one from [Hyperskin](https://gethyperskin.com), but it might be a little too strong for me. I have been using really light concentrations if vitamin C. So I am going to hold off a little on that one and just use it as a spot treatment!	episode_done:True

text:How do deal with being pressure to find “classics” and “timeless pieces” when you feel your style is constantly changing?	labels:I buy/wear items that I like, whether they are in style or not, whether they are considered classic or not. For example, I love high waist pants and maxi skirts - both were "trendy" a couple years ago and I'm so glad they were produced more as a result. I will keep wearing them even though they're no longer trendy, because I love how they look and feel, even if no one else is wearing them.   Another example for me: neutral colors are considered classic, as well as patterns like plaid and houndstooth. But I love fun colors and funky patterns, so those are what I wear most, no matter if others are wearing different styles.  Just because something is labeled classic or trendy by social media, fashion brands, retailers, etc. doesn't mean that we have to adhere to them. You can wear whatever style you like, whenever you like, regardless if others woild label those items trendy or classic.	episode_done:True

text:Does anyone else feel that nothing is unfashionable nowadays?	labels:The present always feels “neutral”. I think if you watch any reality show from the early 2010s, even as late as 2014-15, you’ll see a big difference from what was considered “no defining silhouette” then. things like just a tshirt change slightly in cut and shape over time.
text:Watching "What Not to Wear," even the later seasons, just proves how even what may seem like "universal" or "timeless" rules/silhouettes really do change with time- sometimes very little time. So much about that show just seems so, so dated now even though they tended to avoid overtly trendy clothing.	labels:Proving further that nothing will ever be timeless 😄	episode_done:True

text:Denim Jacket as a Layering Piece	labels:As a mid layer, it looks forced and unnatural to me. I am curious about others thoughts, does this look good to anyone?
text:I tend to agree. That said, whenever it's worn as a mid-layer (especially buttoned up) it looks vaguely reminiscent of a gunslinger vest straight out of Red Dead, so while I can't see myself wearing it, it at least appeals to that part of my brain.    Especially looking at 4, 15, 25, and 31.	labels:Those are actually the fits I liked the most. Different tastes I guess!	episode_done:True

text:Old Joe Fall/Winter 2020	labels:From [Die Workwears description](https://dieworkwear.com/post/170663547619/seven-newish-brands-ive-been-watching)  > The world today is so fraught with division and pettiness, I try to find whatever joy I can. That’s why I have a Google Alert set for “voluminous and oversized trousers that will send guys into a rage about how they can’t believe this is coming back again.” The angry emails I get after posts like this sustain me.   > My Google Alerts recently led me to Old Joe, a Japanese brand that combines vintage workwear and designer fashion. The clothes here have a strong, early-20th century sensibility – work pants, jeep coats, and band collar pullovers – but the silhouettes and materials are a bit more experimental. Wide-legged, voluminous trousers are paired with outerwear that’s been cut with massive shoulders and big, drippy silhouettes. And while you can find your classically styled knitwear here, there are also shaggy mohair sweaters made from bright yellow yarns.   > In some ways, Old Joe reminds me of Needles, Margaret Howell, and Frank Leder, three brands that do similarly modern takes on vintage clothing. There are even faint echoes of ‘80s era Armani in their latest lookbook, especially in how the oversized ensembles are tied together with a string-like belt. Ethan Newton, who put me onto the brand a few years ago (I don’t actually have a Google Alert set for big pants), once told me he thought Old Joe is one of the more interesting brands coming out of Japan. And I think he’s right.

text:What are some of your least favourite brands?	labels:Nike and adidas both exploit near-slave labor while actively covering it up multiple times in the past and being heralded as icons of global culture.

text:I was onboard until you said you burned your Nikes lol.

text:Shinies From the Past - or, What to do with Gifts from Past Relationships?	labels:Depends how/why things ended I think. Passing on a gift is a nice idea. But if things ended badly that “mercenary” feeling isn’t really there and selling it to do something for yourself can feel freeing. When I got divorced I of course returned the engagement ring that had been a family piece, but the diamond wedding band we had bought jointly, along with my ex’s (that he lost not a week later...) I let it sit in a box for a good two years, and then one day I took it, went to see my mom, and we sold it and went shopping at a local boutique that I normally would not have been able to afford. We had a lovely time, lol and I still wear the things I got that day. So instead of horrible memories attached to the useless piece of jewelry I have some nice things for events and fun memories with my mom.  Edit - I did have some less expensive casual pieces from that relationship that I loved, and two that were given to me by my past MIL. The ones from the ex, I loved to wear but couldn’t stomach and finally donated them to goodwill. Two of them were very favorite pieces and for a few years I tried to let the association go, but I just couldn’t. The ones from his mother I may still have in the back of a drawer. Likewise I couldn’t wear them, but nothing that happened was her fault. If I come across them in my next move I’d give them away so they can be worn. But it’s been 10 years and many moves, so I am not sure where they even are.	episode_done:True

text:Never heard of the brand, I google it and the first thing that pops up is sweat pants for 135$... is everyone here rich?  Edit: why am I downvoted? do you actually think 135$ is reasonable for the average guy for sweatpants?	labels:It's reasonable. Fast Fashion is honestly not worth it. Spend more money on far fewer items, they will last longer, feel more comfortable, and look a lot better. Smart planning of a wardrobe beats having a million pieces that barely go together and break down quickly.   Not saying Uniqlo items don't have a place, or that everyone can still afford RC if they just buy fewer clothes, but the cost vs value is good for RC. They aren't a designer label that sells cheap clothes for a high price for the name.	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 19, 2020	labels:Hi y’all!  My 8 year old son has had issues with buttons and laces most his life. We recently found out (3 weeks ago) that he has autistic spectrum disorder and we’ve missed it because he also has a high IQ.  He’s hit a growth spurt recently and I’d like to move his wardrobe to more sensory friendly/ easier to dress himself clothes. He's going to have enough hardships in life, I figure that his clothes don't need to be one of them. It would also be pretty amazing if we could help him develop his own sense of style!  I think that there are pieces in streetwear that would be much easier for him to use than the jeans, flannel and laces boots that I wear. Seriously, this old millennial hipster basically looks like the token bearded bastard on every small batch beer label.  I’m looking for a starting place to find affordable pieces that I can help him start building a new wardrobe out of.  His needs: No buttons, no laces that need to be tied  His preferences: He doesn’t like material touching his calves with the exception of pjs, he dislikes wearing socks or shoes that go above his ankles  His likes: Space, nerd culture, kind messages, bright colors and fun graphics  Side note, my wife was recently diagnosed with cancer for the second time so our budget is really tight with her upcoming treatments.  If you made it this far in my post I appreciate your heroic effort! Thank you for any help you can provide.

You just have to be willing to wear them inside out a few times while you alter them to fit better.   I have the same problem with jeans and these days I just make sure everything directly below the waistband fits well. Then I just take in the waist. Shirts can work the same. My shoulders are broad and never seem to fit anything that fits the rest of my upper body, so I buy a size that fits my shoulders, then tailor the rest to fit.   Never let yourself believe that it’s your body’s fault that your clothes don’t fit. These soulless companies don’t give a shit about your body. They just want to make money from it. Your body gives you life. That’s far more important and more precious than any fast fashion garbage on sale.	episode_done:True

If it annoys YOU to narrow your closet down to just one color, then don’t do it! But don’t dress to appease other people - it’s your life and your body and you should decorate it however makes you happiest. Wearing all pink makes me feel like Elle Woods winning the trial at the end of Legally Blonde. If wearing all neon orange makes you feel like a bad bitch, go to town you fabulous lil traffic cone.

text:Jewelry trends for 2021	labels:While there are trends, I think it would be very hard to wear any kind of jewelry that would seem directly out of fashion. Then it would have to look strongly like a relic, like those multi-chain statement necklaces from 2010, or waterfall necklaces. I can't think of unfashionable rings. Almost everyone likes diamonds, gems, or creative touches - or at least they don't judge them in the same way as other fashion statements, like having a shaved head as a woman, or wearing combat boots.   I like medium-sized jewelry, don't have a particular metal preference, (remember back when everyone was either liking silver or gold?) and I love jewel tones and colorful rings, so it's very often real gemstones like amethyst, or opal, moonstone, emerald, etc. I also buy nature-inspired or slightly morbid looking jewelry (like silver realistic-looking antlers, or a bronze ring shaped a bit like a claw) and don't remember anyone commenting on it or giving it a side eye.   Really, you can't go wrong with jewelry, unless you try very hard, or they include religious symbols.	episode_done:True

I am forced to rely entirely on cashmere to keep myself from freezing to death.  I am a very luxurious lizard.  But if you look at the brands of all my cashmere sweaters (Grana, Halogen, C by Bloomingdales) I'm wearing the materials of the wealthy, but from pedestrian brands! I AM A POOR PERSON MASQUERADING AS A RICH PERSON!  And honestly, that's pretty much the most disgusting personality flaw one can have.

They didn’t have a variety of styles at the store I went to but I later saw they have a lot of variety.

text:General Discussion - January 06, 2021	labels:Changed a zipper on a jacket (lined, light easily tearable fabric, has a storm flap, snap buttons snapped through the old zipper so basically a bitch to work with). Ripped the old zip out, pinned, basted, sewed the storm flap to the new zip, sewed the storm flap to the jacket... and then noticed I HAD THE ZIPPER BACKWARDS. THE PULL WAS ON THE INSIDE. HOLY SHIT WHY MUST I SUFFER. Just THINKING about it makes me angry.        It's all good now though, seam ripping took ages cause I use a too-dense stitch but I've got it basted the right way around now. The lesson here is check your zipper orientation twice (or at least once for fuck's sake) and sew once.

text:Model poses while online shopping	labels:This is so frustrating, I was just on the market for a new peacoat and I knew exactly what I wanted, but I couldn't tell if any of the ones I was looking at were it because of some weird poses.  I tried to check instagram for the brand, just to see if there was any hope that \*somebody\* out there took a picture in the coat and tagged it, but of course this was right after the election when instagram blocked hashtag searching.  Ultimately I bought a coat I figured was fine and, surprise, it's really big on me.  Might've been able to catch that if any of the photos were normal, but alas...
text:I had the same exact thing happen! No picture of it on the model seen from the front with buttons done up. I buy the size they recommended to me, and I could literally be pregnant with twins and fit in there. So mad.

That was my dream aesthetic when I was a young teen, and as an adult I want to lean into that, at least for a little while.  I work in healthcare, so I’m really just in scrubs all day every day, and I like the trend of jogger pants, slim leg pants, and yoga pant-style waistbands.

text:Do You Ever See A Cute Outfit, Try To Replicate It And End Up Hating It On Yourself? How Did You Fix That? Did You Ever Get The Answer As To Why It Didn't "Look Right" On You?	labels:I’ve never liked bootcut pants cuz I don’t like the way my thighs look, so I usually wear baggy pants. BUT, this Christmas I got a pair of really cute, colorful jeans that I was determined to wear even though they were bootcut, so I started out wearing them with oversized tops and then slowly wore more tight and “revealing” shirts as I got more comfortable. I noticed that once I wear them and realize nobody is staring at me or saying I look weird, I barely notice what I wear. I also always bring an oversized jacket with me, so if I ever get insecure I can take a break and cover myself back up.  TLDR, I would suggest slowly starting to wear a few pieces that make you feel less comfortable, and always bringing a backup item that makes you feel confident.	episode_done:True
text:How do comfort vs. style compare in what bottoms you wear?	labels:I mostly wear jeans/pants and I find them to be very comfortable personally. I'm honestly always a little surprised that they're so uncomfortable for most people. Most of my discomfort in skirts/dresses is mental (I just don't feel like me when I wear them).   I think if you enjoy wearing skirts you should keep wearing them, nothing wrong with that. If it's a seasonal thing maybe fleece stockings or something like that will allow you to wear them in the cooler months.
text:When I was at my heaviest weight I was actually *proud* that I didn’t wear proper jeans for 5 years, instead I wore jeggings and leggings under short skirts/dresses.

text:How do you dress for the (extreme) weather where you're from?	labels:The extreme part about the rain in Seattle is the duration and frequency. You can go weeks in the winter where it rains \*every day\*. Maybe not a huge downpour, and there might be breaks where it stops for a few hours, but enough so that nothing every dries out and you have to be constantly prepared to get caught in it. SO here's how I dress to make it suck less:  * All my winter bags are leather (which I oil) or waterproof (like North St or Timbuktu). * I keep a basic shell-type rain jacket packed away in my bag--it's not for warmth, just to keep me dry. I rarely use an umbrella--it's too easy to leave them places, and they drip all over the floor. Plus, if it's really raining hard it's probably also windy. * Wool layers for days--I am obsessed with wool sweaters and cardigans. They'll keep me warm and dry out quickly if I get caught (or just venture out into) light rain that doesn't require a raincoat, plus they're much cuter. If you do need to layer with a rain jacket, the wool is moisture-wicking and will help keep you from getting as sweaty inside the jacket--or keep you warm if it's cold. Then, when you get inside and have to shed your wet AF outer layer, you'll still have something to keep you cozy.  This is also why we all own flannels.  * Treated leather boots, like Dr. Martens, that have good grip on wet pavement and will keep my feet dry. * Just in case, wool socks. They're comfier anyways, and if I do end up getting soaked through my shoe, my feet won't get so cold. * Cropped pants or midi and higher length skirts--you don't want the hem of whatever you're wearing to drag through a puddle. If it's really, really soaking out I also prioritize quick drying fabric on bottom, like my Madewell roadtrip jeggings.  t;dr: Grunge came from the PNW, and never really left, because it's just fucking practical and cozy here. Layers (like a cozy flannel) and smart fabric choices (wool is your FRIEND) are key. That and a good waterproof bag so you just don't have to worry about it.	episode_done:True

text:What ultimate-splurge fashion item would you buy to reward yourself for achieving a big milestone?	labels: pure gold necklace.	episode_done:True
text:How do you think access and privilege affect your taste and sense of style?	labels:To put it bluntly, 100% privilege plays a role in the way people dress because there is increased access to options (including natural fibres, so called “sustainable” clothing, tailoring, etc) that are completely inaccessible for the majority of others.
text:100% on privilege. Over the past few years, I’ve slowly transitioned much of my wardrobe to natural fiber clothing (with the exception of athletic wear - but now there’s recycled options at least!). And I know it’s a privilege to do so, now that I’m further in my career. A $300 slow fashion, locally produced w/ fair wage, pasture raised wool sweater simply isn’t accessible for most. And even secondhand, it’s not cheap by any means. This is why as problematic as Everlane is as a brand, I won’t judge someone for buying a much more affordable wool cardigan there instead of from babaa, if it better fits their financial needs.  However, trends are for sure more physically accessible now than before with e-commerce and social media, for better or for worse. It’s interesting - I’m in my early 30s, so our generation was in jr high / high school just as e-commerce was starting. We were one of the first Facebook user cohorts. I grew up in a sleepy suburb that was ~2 hours from a large city. We had an OK mall, Macy’s was our fanciest department store. Whenever a girl wore something from Nordstrom’s, everyone oohed and ahhed because not only was it more expensive, but you had to be fairly privileged to travel to the city to go shopping.   I still remember our family visiting my older brother in another major city, and he took me to an Urban Outfitters store for the first time. I thought all the clothes were _so cool_ and how awesome that the people had local access to that store?? And now it’s both visually and ‘physically’ accessible through the internets (with their problems as well). In that sense, I do think it’s great - but the trade-off is the exacerbation of fast fashion with trends cycling through and consumed at lightning speed.	labels:You sound like you are from my area and age group! That’s exactly what small town NorCal was like, it was so special to be able to go to “The City” for a day, 2 1/2 hours away.  We drove an hour to get to the closest mall, which was special in itself. Or even for a movie that our small town theater wouldn’t get.	episode_done:True

text:Does anyone else feel that nothing is unfashionable nowadays?	labels:The present always feels “neutral”. I think if you watch any reality show from the early 2010s, even as late as 2014-15, you’ll see a big difference from what was considered “no defining silhouette” then. things like just a tshirt change slightly in cut and shape over time.
text:Yeah, exactly. Like I would say the most fashionable t-shirt cut a few years ago was a v-neck with capped sleeves. Before that, a very long v-neck with longer fitted sleeves (think American Apparel). Now I would speculate that it's either a fitted cropped crew-neck or an over-sized unisex t-shirt. I'm not saying people only wear those types of ts at those times, but that's what is and was most current.     I do think that trends are changing more quickly and thus fewer people can (or bother to) keep up so wearing the exactly what's in vogue right this second is less important than it used to be.     I also think that younger people tend to prioritize being on trend more. Teens in particular are usually still growing so they need new clothes more often anyway. As you get older and spend more time around other older people, your definition of "current" changes. More formal clothing tends to be more timeless too, so once you're wearing work wear 5 days a week the definition of "current" seems to shift.	labels:Seriously when I read this I knew I was old because 2009 feels like about 5 mins ago	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 13, 2021	labels:I was cleaning out old stuff when I found a necklace my grandma gave me for my golden birthday at the age of ten. She told me not to wear it until I was older, and I guess I had just forgotten it.  I've never really been a jewelry guy, especially gold, but I do wear a stainless steel watch and bracelet. Honest opinions on how this looks? I usually wear office casual such as chinos or nice jeans, boots, and sweaters or button downs. I'm not sure if it works with my aesthetic or stainless steel wristwear.  It's only 10 karat and not very valuable, but if I'm not wearing it, I'd rather sell it for what I can and donate to Alzheimer's research or something, from which she's suffering. I just feel like I should put it to use in some way worthy of her rather than wasting it in a box somewhere.  Thanks!  https://imgur.com/a/t1haYaK

text:Model poses while online shopping	labels:As someone who has dabbled in catalog modelling and who works in fashion, there are three explanations:  1. The garment doesn’t fit the model right. Very common - even on a “standard sized” model, things will fit weirdly or not suit them. I am short so I always had to do odd poses so the garment wasn’t swimming on me  2. It’s part of the brand’s ✨aesthetic✨ or artistic vision. Usually dictated by the marketing team and photographer etc.   3. The brands need to find a way to make their fast fashion look “fancy” or “cool”, especially compared to their competitors who are often selling the exact same product	episode_done:True

text:Congrats! Which one are you getting?	labels:Thank you! I’m looking mostly at YSL and Gucci. Supposedly YSL changes their look less often so that’s the direction to go (between the two) if you don’t want to look “dated.” I like small bags with long chains (I guess cross body but I don’t wear them that way).

text:What is your "White Whale" fashion product that apparently doesn't exist?	labels:For me it’s earrings. I have a very specific idea in my head of the emerald and pearl earrings of my dreams, but I’ve been unable to find “the ones”. Honestly I should probably just look into having them custom made by a jeweler, but I think it would be way over my budget right now. Nevertheless, I always keep a look out just in case!
text:Custom jewelry is surprisingly cheap! I'd talk to your local jeweler. I designed my own wedding ring and because I already knew what I wanted, they pretty much charged cost of materials (gold and stones) which ended up being WAY cheaper than a  similar off the shelf ring. If you really want to save money, you could procure the emeralds and pearls yourself and bring them to the jeweler and they would only charge you for a simple setting (unless your idea is more complex, not sure what you have in mind). Consults are usually free, it's worth a shot!	labels:Seconded! I have thin fingers, and when we were shopping for bands the smallest stock sizes at this one local place were several sizes too large, and the woman behind the counter just launched into asking what I'd like in a ring since they'd have to make one rather than resize. When I tried to backpedal, she told us it would even be cheaper since it would use less metal.   Someone still had to make the jewelry in the display case. At the local jewelers, the guy who does is usually in the back somewhere and can talk through it with you himself.	episode_done:True
text:What is your "White Whale" fashion product that apparently doesn't exist?	labels:Decent homewear. Especially robes that aren't bathrobes nor these dainty fragile satin/chiffon thingies.

In loungewear there's apparently four types with no middle ground: For mothers-formerly-known-as-women,  for girls, for seduction purposes only, and Jeff Lebowski.

The guys from the main collection seem to be wearing more conservative colour pallets, the girls despite ostensibly wearing similar stuff contribute subtly more aggressive colours. Good shit.	labels:Very well said. I think there some some neat looks from the women really pushing the envelope in terms of pallets and purposeful clashing which I enjoyed seeing. There have been some really awesome inspo albums featuring looks from women that I would like to wear as well in similar styles. I think this is a trend that we will be seeing more of in the upcoming years as women begin to adopt more clothing traditionally worn by just men.

text:How do I feel sexy at home in winter?	labels:Oh, this one hits home. This year, I made an effort to upgrade my whole workout and athleisure wardrobe. I got tons of gorgeous, flattering and simply made to look good athleisure wear (color coordinated sets were a particular beauty) and got to wear them to the gym and at home throughout most of the year post winter. It was so awesome and I loved every second of it. I got to live out my athleisure wardrobe dreams.  This all went belly up this winter :(. It’s just too cold to be able to wear any of the cute leggings or long sleeved crop tops without freezing. Warming the house more isn’t viable since my partner can take only so much heat (men and women typically have different temperature needs, so one has to compromise). Long story short, I’m back to my ratty old sweats and double layer tops and sweatshirts that make me look like I gave up on nice clothes. I too really need help finding very warm and cute looking athleisure clothing of high quality (Lulu Lemon, PE Nation, Michi, Alo Yoga are some of my favorites in general).
text:I’m in a similar situation.  What everyone is recommending is for a cool fall day - they will not work if you’re stationary in the deep north!  Heating bills are expensive!  I try to wear soft and snuggly fabrics like cashmere and chenille, but really the best thing is sipping warm liquids.  If I have a warm cup of tea, I can finally produce enough body heat to warm up the nice fabrics.  Otherwise I’m just cold and my clothes are cold.	labels:I like big turtlenecks over fleecy-lined leggings and wool socks for the sexy/cozy feel!	episode_done:True

text:Does anyone else not factor in pants when creating outfits? How to move away from this?	labels:As someone who LOVES pants and has a problem with buying any patterned pants I see...  Other people have suggested black jeans which is great, they go with anything. I would add white to that, as well as dark/light wash jeans. There’s also the earth tones like khaki and beige that I find work with a lot of colors, and they are a neutral that people can overlook.   For really branching out though, I suggest basing it on the colors of your wardrobe. Consider the colors you most often wear. For example, I wear a lot of jewel tones, which look great paired with olive green, so I bought some olive green pants. another color suggestion for jewel tones would be something like burgundy. If you wear more pastel colors, I often see baby pink/dusty pink pants being sold, and that could look really lovely paired with lilacs, sky blues, and whites.  Another thing to consider is silhouettes you like. Personally I don’t venture too far out of high waisted skinny pants silhouette, but it does help me narrow down what pants to purchase. Maybe take a look at the jeans you have and decide if you really like the silhouette, try out other pants with that style, or venturing out into different cuts of jeans/pants and seeing how that matches with your wardrobe.

text:Is fast fashion really fast fashion if you get years of use out of the garments?	labels:The point here is to move towards clothing that's sustainable or in other words: - provides jobs and fair wages to the local community - is completely biodegradable, doesn't leach chemicals/microplastics - Doesn't use chemicals in manufacturing - Low water and carbon footprint (no deforestation) - Comfortable silhouettes - Quality weaves - Timeless designs  Most of the toxins in point 2 and 3 do not end up in privileged communities, they affect the underprivileged. Their water, food, their villages are all polluted so we can wear a fancy new dress on Saturday night. They also get exploited cause with low wages, especially women and children because they can't go anywhere else. People don't know this because: 1. Out of sight, out of mind 2. Their voices are suppressed 3. They are oppressed  What can u do? - Invest in smaller, local businesses - Pay the tailor, cobbler to fix and upgrade your clothes instead of tossing them out and buying anew - thrift or borrow from friends (If it's just for one occassion). In India we literally inherit sarees across generations 😊 - invest in plant fabrics and weaves (cotton, linen, bamboo, pinatex, cork), renewable animal fabrics (wool, ethical silk) - if you have more access to animal fabrics (leather, goatskin) go for secondhand or deadstock fabric before looking at brands that breed/hunt and kill just for fabric. It's okay, some places just don't have access to other fabrics or other fabrics just don't work in that location 🤷🏻  Tl;dr Go low 'footprint' and balance out that which causes the least harm - to the planet, the animals, the people involved, including YOU! The cycle isn't complete without you too. This is Ahimsa.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else feel that nothing is unfashionable nowadays?	labels:I’ve kind of been feeling this too, but I wonder how much is just me getting older and caring less whether other people like my outfit and more just if I do. We’re also in the midst of a silhouette flip from tight bottom, loose top, to loose bottom, tight top. That means people are wearing both right now and it feels like you can get away with more. (People may say we’ve already made the flip, but those people live in more fashionable cities than I do 😛)  Length is still defining though - most pants are still cropped. Long tops are hard to find and tucking tops in some way is still the norm. These little things make a big difference over a decade. If I style early 2000s jeans and t shirt, I’d wear a really long shirt with low rise pants that go all the way to meet my shoes and I wouldn’t have to think about what socks I’m wearing. If I put on a late 2010s version, I’d do high rise cropped straight leg, make sure I have no show socks and I’d tuck the front of my boxy T-shirt.  All that said, I do feel like you can get away with a lot and still look like you’re making a fashionable choice if you have enough confidence and your hair and makeup are current.

text:How do some people put outfits together so effortlessly. Fashionista's please help.	labels:Hi! Former stylist.  1) Pay attention to the fit of things and figure out what cuts and shapes look good on you. Paper bag pants and some joggers have similar fits. Some mini skirts and shorts hit the same place on your legs and can have the same waist height. Find your sweet spot and don’t be afraid to buy multiple things in silhouettes that work for you.   2) Get some statement pieces that you would die for. If you are wearing a pair of jeans that fit well and a t-shit purchased within the past 3 years with some awesome earrings you going to look and feel great. If you are wearing an amazing dress and simple white sneakers you are going to look and feel great. Don’t overthink things but try and wear at LEAST one piece you are excited about at a time.   3) Don’t buy things just cause they are on sale, you saw your friend wearing it, or you feel like you “need” something in your wardrobe. You should love everything in your closet in its own special way unless it’s workwear and you hate your dress code for work. Something as simple as a T-shirt has so many different factors like cut, material, neckline, sleeve length. Purchase what feels good and don’t bother with the rest.
text:ALL OF THIS. Great comment.   Trends will always come and go, but if you know what colours and silhouettes look good on your body, you can pick and choose which trends to follow.  For my short legs and hourglass shape, I know I won't suit bodycons (highlights my short legs), crew necks (uniboob effect), or anything designed to end higher than mid-thigh. I also know that anything high waisted, V/square neck, or flared/wide legged will look great. Saves a lot of time and money!   [This video](https://youtu.be/DNDrVVoHtAw) by Busbee Style has a guide to finding your body type, then a video for each one. Her channel is great, and helped me figure a lot of things out.

And that replaced the same exact shoe that I had for years before that.  Now there’s an offer for Apple Card that gives me $75 cash back for Nike, expiring Sunday. So I may as well put it towards a semi-decent pair of shoes so I don’t look like a teenager wearing the same pair of shoes every single day.  But I have very little fashion sense so I need some advice from you guys.   One thing I’ll say is that I’m tall and skinny/lanky with long legs and big feet and as much as I like the idea of a “showy” looking pair of sneakers, I feel like they’d look like clown shoes on me.

text:What was your "how in the name of all that is holy did this end up in a thrift store" find?	labels:Not me, but in high school my best friend at the time found a legitimate vintage Chanel bag with a broken clasp. It was dusty, and in otherwise perfect condition aside from the clasp, no tears or scuffs. We figured it was probably a knockoff but it was cute so she took it somewhere to get repaired and seen as to whether it was real or not. Turns out it was from the 50s, an original run of the iconic 2.55 handbag. We were amazed.   She could have sold it for a nice chunk of change, but she kept it because it was such an amazing find. Only $3 too. I still can't believe it was just chilling on a shelf at a run down Value World for so long, and they didn't even realize what it was worth.

Sometimes if I’m really cold there’s a biiit of show thru but that’s very rare. Depending on my shower material the lace does too but I can’t care that much  Edit: I have an alert on eBay for NF in my size, I never pay more than $30. I can’t afford 3/$70 bras every year or two	labels:	episode_done:True

text:You might get lucky at Banana Republic. Their "regular" sales are about 40-60% off, which is what you should expect. I bought a grey herringbone top coat at $200, and that was on the high end. I've scored some good stuff on their sale rack (plus 60% off), such as a navy peacoat for $100 and an olive overcoat (forgot the name of the style) for $70	labels:Second this. I have a really nice Italian wool coat that I got from BR with one of their mega-discounts.	episode_done:True
text:Down Jackets	labels:A majority of down is plucked from living geese. They are subjected to this torture every molting season until slaughter. Please buy a more ethical coat
text:Patagonia has specifically addressed this in their supply chain.  "Patagonia Traceable Down is traced from parent farm to apparel factory to help ensure that the birds that supply it are protected by the strongest animal welfare and consumer assurance standards. These include robust requirements in all areas of the birds’ life, and especially protects against force-feeding and live-plucking."  [Patagonia Traceable Down](https://www.patagonia.com.au/pages/patagonia-traceable-down)	labels:In addition to this. I believe patagonia uses recycled down from old duvets, pillows and such that they wash and reuse in their manufacturing.

text:Happiest Season Inspo Album because I have a big gay crush on Kristen Stewart	labels:I feel like oversized blazers are still the trendy thing, which is why that’s all you’ll find at like Zara, asos, etc. Lots of more workwear focused stores still have more traditional and slim cuts. J Crew and Banana Republic usually have options in fun fabrics!

I do love vintage styles so I'm probably looking for something that's been out of production for 40 years but I just want me some good wool Katharine Hepburn-esque trousers, dammit.

text:Stylish ways to carry emergency medication?	labels:Anaphylactic to dairy and tree nuts here! Had the same problem for the longest time. Recently purchased this crossbody bag:  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HFZRSWJ/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_glc_fabc_1-29FbTERPP91?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1  It’s not fancy or anything but I liked it. And there are lots of similar bags (leather maybe for you? Something like that wouldn’t be odd in a more professional, dressed-up situation) that would more fit your style. I just liked that one. It’s also spacious enough that it can hold my phone, wallet, keys, and even my inhaler (yeah I have asthma too, not exactly the pinnacle of health up in here) with room to spare.   I would also, as others have suggested, recommend talking to your doctor about getting an Auvi-Q. It is considerably smaller.   Also, I carry my Benadryl in a contact lenses case, oddly enough. They’re incredibly compact and completely waterproof.  And my last weird tip (though this is something I haven’t done since like high school): maybe consider getting a runner’s fanny pack? I know, ew. But they’re super thin and lightweight. When I was younger and a bit more self conscious about carrying my meds, I was able to get away with wearing that under my clothes. It was virtually unnoticeable. It would depend on the outfit obviously but that’s just an option. And like I said, I’ve stopped doing that because what kind of weirdo is gonna give you a hard time about carrying life-saving medicine with you?    Hope this helps! We gotta look out for each other in this sick, Nutella-obsessed world.
text:Thanks so much for your detailed reply! I really like the look of that crossbody bag, and I feel like they've become a lot more stylish in recent years. Might look into getting a black or brown leather one for fancy occasions, since I think it would blend in a lot more if it matched my belt/shoes.  But yeah, first things first I'm definitely going to look into getting an Auvi-Q. I actually haven't heard of those until people started mentioning them in this thread, so I'm really excited. If it fits in the inside pocket of a blazer, that's good enough for me. Hell, even if I need to take it to a tailor to get the pocket made large enough to fit it, that would still be worth it.	labels:I can vouch for carrying around an auvi-q, it's so much more convenient than having to carry the bulky epipen. the one i have on me is about 2 inches wide by ~3.5 inches tall, and it's slightly thicker than my phone with the phone case on.	episode_done:True

A well fitting dark turtlenecks, black jeans, Chelseas and a casual peacoat (not double breasted) would be my ideal outfit.  The problem is, I can't seem to expand much beyond this specific outfit. Anything else I think of just feels like too much color. I'm not a fan of patterns either. Does anyone have any suggestions to expand my wardrobe? I'm a university student, btw, if that is relevant in any way.   I'm sorry, I know this all sounds very vague, but I'm not used to tossing around technical words!

text:All things K-Fashion!	labels:I got into kdramas and kpop in 2016 and havent looked back since! I genuinly have no idea what western fashion trends are anymore and they dont interest me. I'm not a curvy girl and have no interest showing off any signs of curves that i do have. I dress pretty conservative because of my anxiety, so kfashion is right up my alley (minus all the mini skirts lol). I love all the feminine blouses, cosy coats, oversized jumpers, cute bows etc. It's the same with makeup trends. In the west everyone seems obsessed with crazy eyeshadow looks and the more you can turn yourself into a painting, the better. I have zero interest in doing that so minimalist kbeauty is a lifesaver.   I havent bought clothes in a longass time, but for people looking for cheap brands h&m has really good stuff that you can easily turn into kfashion outfits if you wanted to.	episode_done:True

Pretty sure that if I was doing this with the exact same top and bottom people would not notice.
text:This is me too, even in my office job. I have a lot of tattoos that need to be covered so when I find a top that I like that covers them I will buy a few.

I have lots of pieces from The Kooples and live in high waisted black skinny jeans, newsboy caps and doc marten boots.   Pros - people seem to like my style when I go to concerts etc. (I think).

They're all fairly classic things so style isn't an issue. I enjoy wearing them, it is just a weird quirk that only I seem to have.

Flared and bootcut jeans. I see flared pants and bootcut but not denim because people realized that tight jeans are not comfortable  2.)

The silver seems more interesting, but may not be as versatile in terms of working with my outfits. Is there any way i can settle this or should i just flip a coin?

The XS/S version of it I think I only found by pure luck ($90 at Nordstrom Rack), but now I'm desperately wanting the XXS.

text:(UPDATE) Ladies who miss fashion/makeup/getting dressed up... how are you doing?	labels:I still have to wear at least a reasonable shirt for work, and a combination of zoom and terrible lighting in my apartment means I'm wearing more makeup than ever before to avoid looking like either a pale ghost or a zombified skull, depending on the angle of the sun.  But you know what I miss? SHOES. We don't wear shoes inside the house, so I rarely even put them on anymore. And there was a big part of being dressed down to my shoes and like... the stompy feeling of boots, and the clack of heels that made me feel like I was ready to take on the world -- definitely a contributor to good mental health.   I miss shoes. :(
text:Definitely relate to this. I really prefer to wear skirts and dresses most of the time, and most of mine are midi-length...which means they look best with heels of some sort. I'm a singer, so I finally decided indoor wear was permissible for character shoes and a pair of block heels I've mostly used for auditions in the past.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 07, 2020	labels:Hey all! First time posting here. I'm looking to get a French Work/Chore Jacket, and wondering if anyone could recommend specific brands and sizes. I've been really eyeing the blue Le Mont St. Michel jacket ([https://lemontsaintmichel.fr/en/men-coats-jackets/genuine-work-jacket-1256-v13295.html#/size-48/color-blue](https://lemontsaintmichel.fr/en/men-coats-jackets/genuine-work-jacket-1256-v13295.html#/size-48/color-blue)), and also been looking into Le Laboureur and Vetra.  I really like the history behind these brands and the apparent quality of the jackets (hoping to have it last a lifetime), but given how expensive a lot of these items are I wanted to make this post and see if people have specific recommendations or insights. Hoping to not spend more than $250, and I'm located in Brooklyn, NY. I'm also 6', and wear a medium with nearly all the clothes I own. Thanks so much for your time!
text:The best one I own (like 4 years back I went chore coat crazy. I have like 20 of them now) is a   La Laboureur one. That or the super vintage French blue one I got in a London thrift store.

text:Is fast fashion really fast fashion if you get years of use out of the garments?	labels:I hear Old Navy being called fast fashion all the time, but I have  a good number of favorites from there that have held up for 5+ years. Plus, when I do shop it's only for the things I need, and I'll often go months without buying any new clothes.  Meanwhile there are plenty of wealthy people (or middle class people) buying top-name brands who throw out their wardrobe every year and replace the whole thing, or go shopping every weekend.  And ultimately a brand saying they're made more sustainably doesn't mean they're completely free of any exploitation or harm to the environment, either. It's unfair to put this huge burden on the consumer to live in a perfectly environmentally-friendly way when the vast majority of the *blame* for harm to the environment is on major corporations who are actually doing the mass producing. It's also unfair to hold up a standard of individual moral "purity" that the majority of people cannot afford. Ultimately, saving the environment is something that will only be accomplished with the cooperation of those with the power to make large-scale change, and currently those corporations put an undue amount of pressure on individual consumer decision-making instead of making those decisions themselves.  But I digress a bit - to answer your question, i think it's more about how you buy and consume things than about the label. If you limit what you buy to just what you need with a couple of indulgences here and there, and shop thrift stores or resold items instead of buying new all the time, you're being WAY more sustainable than someone who drops the cash on buying high-end "green" brands in amounts way more than they need.
text:It seems like fast fashion sometimes gets used as a catch-all for what gets perceived as "cheap" brands.  Old Navy doesn't even seem to churn out alot of styles quickly.  If you're a long time shopper you know that they have certain styles/cuts they bring out every single year (their fall flannels, their fit and flare summer dresses).  If you steer away from the high poly % or jersey fabrics, Old Navy stuff can last a long time.	labels:	episode_done:True

I work for a retailer and part of my position is selecting photos to be used online and in emails, and we are always aware and mindful of making sure we have at least one very straight forward selling shot + the more fun and playful shots.

text:Fashion "fantasies" coming true years later?	labels:Male here (kind of important for this story).  Growing up I was always really jealous of female fashion, makeup and the ability to express yourself in your clothing (and it not coming down purely to details or fabric). I dabbled in the japanese rock scene back in HS, partly because I really liked the music, partly because it opened up a lot of opportunities for exploration. I didn't have the guts to go all the way though, but did some light makeup and had sort-of feminine haircuts.  Anyway, past HS this was all behind me, except in my art where I kept my aesthetic alive, though never consciously setting out to do so. I've since moved the canvas onto myself, so haven't picked up the pen much at all lately.   Fast forward 10 years or so, and I'm standing at a graduation ceremony. I work as a teacher, and I'm saying goodbye to my students, since summer break is about to come up. All teachers are lined up, and I look at my female colleagues and feel a real sting of jealousy. I'm standing there dressed in a shirt and pants while they're wearing lovely dresses, with earrings, makeup and bags.  I decided enough was enough, and went and bought nail polish the same day, and booked a time to pierce both my ears the day after. This all coincided with a long solo trip to Japan, where I bought a ton of makeup and really started to let lose. I also started (slowly) incorporating female cuts and items into my wardrobe, but every step needed quite a bit of courage, heck they still do. My comfort zone has blown wide open but anything beyond what I wear regularly gives some slight anxiety.  Then in 2020 I started posting here, getting feedback and help, and through constant cheering from colleagues, friends and students I finally feel like anxiety isn't keeping me away from expressing myself the way I want.  &#x200B;  So yeah, kind of a tangent, but that's my fashion fantasy coming true.

text:How often do you wash your clothes?	labels:This is all assuming normal wear (ie I don't spill a plate of spaghetti on myself).  * Underwear/socks, face masks-- 1 and done * Bras-- 3-4 wears * Tops-- 3-4 wears * Sweaters/sweatshirts (always worn with something under them) as needed * Pants-- 4-5 wears * PJs-- 4 wears or whenever I wash my sheets (I have this thing where if I have fresh sheets on my bed, I need fresh PJs) * Gym clothes (when that's a thing again)-- 1 and done.  I'm predisposed to sweat heavily.  But for me it is not how often I wash clothes but HOW I wash clothes.  I was exclusively on cold water with a tiny amount of (free and clear) detergent.  I am allergic to dryer sheets, so I avoid the dryer completely (communal facility, a lot of residue).  I use a drying rack to dry.  ETA-- Hand washing is my line in the sand.  NO WAY!   Also with jeans, I wash inside out. I use mesh bags as needed.
text:How do you keep your clothes from being stiff when you use the drying rack? I want to stop using the dryers at my apartment complexes laundry facility, but my towels are always stiff and scratchy.	labels:This is probably due to how hard the water is. In my hometown the washing isn't stiff at all after being hung up, but in my current city the towels could stand on their own once they're dry. A bit of vinegar in the washing machine helps.	episode_done:True
text:Is the high fashion industry a little tone-deaf for F/W 2020?	labels:The high fashion industry is perpetually faux-woke. This tragedy is just kind of throwing light on that.  Also I think expecting every designer to conform to specific trends just... Doesn’t make sense. Even if some of the flashier ones want to do a 180, its very unlikely they can, as they would have to get their teams to come up with new designs, go through drafting processes, get samples–also very difficult to do right now because of C19–redo their ad campaigns, and find retailers to purchase their clothes, not to mention the loss they would take on everything that had gone into production or pre-production pre-c19.	episode_done:True

The return process was easy and quick so I'll give them that. But I don't think I'd buy from them again.  While not necessarily "lesser known," I discovered [Alexis Mabille](https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2020-couture/alexis-mabille/slideshow/collection) on /r/ffacj_discussion while we were discussion digital runways. I think his [silhouettes](https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/spring-2020-couture/alexis-mabille/slideshow/collection) are beautiful. I have no where to wear couture but I definitely enjoy admiring it through my computer screen lol  I'll update when I can think of more brands I've discovered through ffa or ffacj_discussion  EDIT:  A few weeks ago there was a thread about unique shoes (maybe?) and someone linked [Shoe Bakery](https://shoebakery.com/collections/shoes).

I have to wear business professional clothing every day, and I have tried everything from forever 21 to banana republic to high end like Veronica beard, Alice and Olivia etc...the brand that is my tried and true workhorse is Theory. Their good wool suiting especially. I’ve had pieces for 5 years that I wear once a week and they look like I bought them yesterday. They have sales every now and then and I noticed they opened an outlet website during Covid. Moderate price point for the quality: $200-400 per piece.	episode_done:True

The coat is a JCrew peacoat XS and the body is ok, the sleeves are just about an inch too long (which hopefully explains why I can't get things that "just fit" out the box a lot of the time, haha). I imagine if I *can* get it fitted it'll be pretty expensive, though?

My uniform in like 2004/5 was low rise hollister skinny jeans, PUFFY ETNIES skater sneakers (+1 if they were the black sneakers with hot pink laces with stars) or crazy colored converse and a white studded belt, some terrible local bands t shirt and side bangs. Not just regular side bangs but side bangs that hid one eye completely   Then later we all discovered hairspray so we all got super choppy long mullets and teased the shit out of them. And still had side bangs but even swoopier and more comb-overy   Makeup was full bottom(!) waterline black eyeliner and the NUDE Mac lipstick that looked like foundation  * edit: I do remember my first pair of high waisted black skinny jeans in maybe 2007/8 and boy howdy did those BDGs change my life. Also this memory makes me feel very old because I can distinctly pinpoint the periods in my life when I aged into and then aged out of urban outfitters. D:  * edit edit : wow wow ok so I do remember in the very early 2000s (maybe 2001?) a friend of mine being extremely excited to wear a sleeveless collared tank with a tie(??) to the first day of middle school a la Avril Lavigne and that was THE COOLEST

Celine taught me that you don't have to have a cohesive "style", just wear what you want and what makes you happy even if it is over the top.

I didn't bring most of them with me when I moved, but the one coat I do have here (circa Autumn 2010?), while definitely not bad, is hardly impressive either.

text:General Discussion - November 17, 2020	labels:Lukewarm take: Drake's reached its peak during 2015-2017 and has only been going downhill since
text:My take: they've never been an especially good value but they do as much fun stuff now as ever. They just do a lot more of the meh stuff because they're getting more attention and because scale = money.	labels:They're obviously still good value compared to any non-menswear brands, but that's just to get counterarguments out of the way. Their only real "value" now is in strength of fun designs like some of their ties, squares, and especially scarves. Sample sale prices of $40 per tie have demonstrated that their ties are exorbitantly priced for their quality level since smaller companies such as Vanda, Vecchio Anseatico and even Viola Milano offer ties of similar build quality. Now whether you'll find a shantung or ancient madder in a particular shade or pattern at those companies is a different matter, but the pure value prospect just isn't there anymore.  Their foray into private label shoes and the like was when things started going downhill imo, and it's only progressed with the sportswear. My theory is that they saw how online MTM and places like Spier can essentially near-replicate the look for much cheaper and decided to branch out into an other niche, but it's not nearly as effective as their 2015-2017 run	episode_done:True

text:(UPDATE) Ladies who miss fashion/makeup/getting dressed up... how are you doing?	labels:I'm just... still getting dressed up. This has actually given me a nice opportunity to try new combinations of outfits and pull out pieces that I wasn't sure about before. The routine of getting dressed and feeling put together is really important for me with regards to getting into the work mindset.
text:Agreed. I’m not really a fashion person, but the act of getting dressed helps set the mood for my work day. It’s like a signal to my brain that it’s time to work, and changing at the end of the day is a signal that it’s time for something else.   For the first few months of quarantine I was wearing sweats most days, and I actually got really depressed and was having trouble shutting off after work and transitioning into relaxation.   So I started wearing jeans instead of sweats, and taking them off at the end of the day (like I would when I got home from work) and it really helped.   Then one day I started reaching for my old favorite blouses from before, rather than tshirts, and it helped even more.   I’m not wearing makeup though... that just seems like a waste still lol.	labels:i wholeheartedly agree. i've always thought i dress up for me, but i've had a suspicion that it was to impress, stad out, outshine etc. now it looks like i'm on my way to fashion week taking out the trash! i just don't feel like me in sweats, and my style has improved as well because i take more "risks" in my style because i simply can't seek validation or disapproval on my outfits. feels great to feel good about myself just because i do, and not because of others!	episode_done:True

I have no idea how the second hand market value would effect their desirability and prominence...and that might be nigh on impossible to work out.   Personally, however I now feel really gross about wearing stuff from the very unethical brands.

text:How does a warm weather wardrobe differ from a cold weather wardrobe?	labels:Live in Southern California by the beach where it’s pretty much 70-80 year round and now in school in Philadelphia where there’s currently a snow storm lol. Back at home I keep a wardrobe of   Spring to Fall: typical surfer girl staples of shorts, T-shirts, tank tops, flip flops, rompers, I’m not a skirt type of person but you can wear that. CA fashion is really casual so unless you’re an influencer or fashionista not many people are wearing daytime maxi skirts or dresses. I never wear long sleeves during this time. Will wear sneakers or heels. If you see anyone in boots, it’s either rain boots or people pretending CA gets any type of “fall sweater weather.” Jean jackets or hoodies at nighttime in fall or if you go by the water where it could get windy. Yes to cardigans if you expect to be indoors at an office that likes to keep things cold. But very light material.  Winter: same as above during the daytime. Add jeans, will carry around a light jacket for nighttime. Again I don’t really wear thick chunky sweaters. When I went to college in the Bay Area, I did wear long sleeves because it does get windy in San Francisco. The weather occasionally went down to 40F. But rarely, so I would just wear one of those uniqlo light down jackets. Layering isn’t really a thing. So you can get away with bra, long sleeve, jacket if you go outside and jeans down below. Anything more than that you’ll be sweating. You can ditch the thermal undies, snow jacket with down feathers, snow boots, gloves, and hats.	episode_done:True

text:What will be obsolete by summer 2021?	labels:I think we are seeing the removal of skinny jeans.  Not they won't exist anymore, but that they are going to be very dated looking.  I think of this like the boot cut that skinny replaced, you could still get them, people wore them, but the dominate fashion pant was the skinny jean.   When I look around on line I see a fuller leg with a shorter hem (crop, the pant I hate, if I am that hot, its not that 2" above my ankle that needs extra air, and in winter I don't want that exposure, or always being in a taller boot, and or matching my socks, oh how I have the crop, back to the subject).  I also see higher waist pants becoming much more dominant, possibly making not only low waist but also natural waist pants looking dated.  Again, I will say, just as you could always find bootcut, you will still be able to find a full length skinny pant.    In shirts, the crop/waist I can see continuing especially if the higher waist pant becomes more fashionable.  I can also see more fitted shirts that you tuck in, especially body suit types, as they go with the higher waist, looser leg.  Longer tunic type tops may move out of fashion agin because they work best with a skinny pant.  As I am typing I just got it, I see a "flip" on the silhouette, from full top to a fitted bottom to a fitted top to a fuller bottom.
text:What is a "natural waist pant", exactly? I'm not sure I understand the distinction between a "natural waist pant" and a high-waisted pant, since the idea of high-waisted pants is to hit the natural waist. Not sure that people wear pants higher than their natural waist, and if they do, I don't think that's what most people are referring to when talking about high-waisted pants.	labels:Yeah that's weird, I think OP is just confused. "high waisted" = at the natural waist. Lower than that is "mid rise" and even lower, sitting on the hips, is low rise.   But what I've noticed, in general, is that a lot of people don't seem to realize where their actual waist is. Like, it's not automatically at your belly button, a lot of the times it's higher. The waist is where the torso bends, not wherever your pants go up to or where your belly button is.   People go on and on about how they hate high waist pants and prefer mid waist, but then you realize that what a lot of them are referring to is a pair of pants that sits at their natural waist, so it's high waisted for them.  Highrise, midrise, lowrise aren't strict measurements. What's mid-rise on me is going to be high-rise on someone else, etc.	episode_done:True

text:Can you have a clothing style without actually wearing that certain style much?	labels:I’m really late to this. But I think it’s important to remember that your style isn’t limited to what clothes you wear. It’s how you carry yourself, how you decorate your room, the music you listen to, the movies you like, etc. One of these things doesn’t define a person, but usually when you start adding everything up, a style comes out.	episode_done:True
text:What’s going to be the next shoe of the year	labels:From a less practical/everyday standpoint I think lightly-slouchy leather boots are making a comeback, layered under a big coat and/or midi skirt. The trend has been around since ~2017 but i'm seeing it more this year.
text:Wait weren't slouchy boots like 2006-2007 (or somewhere abouts -- definitely earlier than 2017)? They're good if you're petite, because you can scrunch.	labels:Tbh 06'-07' suede or leather wrinkly booties give me ptsd. What I'm thinking of is more of the 80s slouchy boot trend mixed with today's classic minimal styles, its really a lewk  that the fashion sphere has 'grown into' & made more accessible over the past few years imo ( [example](https://www.pinterest.ca/pin/AdeJaF8o0DxUiS-g9GJnX9Xy8yTpOC1gq2GKN89XMoezh6D1mczPpo4/), [another example](https://i.pinimg.com/564x/63/01/db/6301dba94375564434208b4767ce9619.jpg) ).

text:I definitely recommend reading boba’s guide but also start shopping secondhand. It’s the only way to find interesting well-made clothes without spending a fortune.    If you’re buying cheap clothes from the same places everyone else is then you’re going to look like everyone else.  Other than socks and underwear, commit to exclusively shopping secondhand for a period of time. After that time is up I bet you won’t go back to buying new. Similar to eating well, it’s amazing how many things just fall into place by shopping secondhand.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Learning to dress better	labels:I would refer to the established guides in MFA first to build the foundation of developing style. Everyone's style is different (budget, size, colour preference, etc) so there isn't just some quick bullet points that can "define style". How I like to figure out style is to browse online such as websites like Highsnobiety, or Instagram accounts (@hidden.ny) and just save photos. Build up a folder that you can reference so if you see something in store that is similar to something you saw then you know what to buy.   In regards to hair, I think this is very important. There's nothing worse than spending a lot of money on a nice wardrobe but have a crappy haircut. Think of it this way; your tshirt or jeans may be worn once or twice a week at most; your hair is part of your outfit 24/7. Invest in a good haircut and products to maintain it. Growing your hair isn't an issue as there are plenty of guides for longer hairstyles.

text:How do you think access and privilege affect your taste and sense of style?	labels:I grew up solidly middle class in a working/middle class community. My parents always felt it was important to dress well. This didn’t necessarily mean expensive but well fitting, good quality and in-style clothing was important. I started caring about my own fashion around age 10 and my mother helped me pick out Bongo jeans and 5-7-9 brand stuff (anyone remember this store; headbands, earrings, top to bottom matching) I moved on to Bebe, Wet Seal, Guess and Esprit in high school, nothing too crazy but typical for my peer group. My parents could afford to give me a monthly clothing allowance and I also spent my own pocket money and small paychecks from my part time job on clothes, shoes and bags. I was featured a lot in the high school yearbook’s fashion pages. Lol. Privileged but reasonable.  College and grad school away was eye opening for me. I never really thought about luxury brands before. Some of my friends had Chanel, YSL purses but I never really wanted or could afford luxury brands at that age. I can probably afford a YSL bag now though still my typical purse is Tory Burch or something mid-priced since I don’t really take great care of my things. Fashion to me now is well-made basics. I like Madewell, All Saints and Nordstrom/Saks. Admittedly, I am not very fashionable or trendy and stick to basics.   All in all, I consider myself pretty fortunate though not particularly fashionable by choice.	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - January 01, 2021	labels:Brexit currently proving to be (for me) a total clusterfuck. Nowhere will deliver out of the UK without express delivery (£20 vs. free). The Kooples is having a sale at 50% off in the UK but only 30% in the EU, and of course they won't deliver abroad. Selfridges has the same sale and WILL deliver but when I get to the cart the total increases by £10 every time I interact with the page and they're claiming I'll have to pay £20 per item import duty when it arrives. To top it all off the pound went _up_ slightly.  Clothes aside it's a sad day for Britain. I'm having a hard time figuring out _what_ exactly has happened. Both sides are arguing the same points as somehow being in their favour - customs union + less regulation = more money to Britain and less paperwork, but nobody will buy any of our shit because our exports are services which will involve a (now massive) amount of paperwork due to differences in regulation, so no money to Britain. _sigh_
text:Is that because of brexit or just how it would have normally been though? Most big retailers have different regional websites that dont ship between each other, sales on at different times etc. and VAT would be on purchases anyway.  I am definitely no brexit supporter either btw, daftest thing UK has done in a long while.	labels:It's mostly the shipping and lack of clarity on import duty that's bothering me. Sites are refusing to ship normally (only express available at ~£20), are charging extra to "cover import duty" which I'm sure isn't applicable, or outright refusing to ship when they normally would without issue.  Right now things are a mess and the sales might be over (or the items I want sold out) by the time things are cleared up.	episode_done:True

text:Can I see your casual natural-fabric outfits?	labels:I’ve seen some affordable cashmere, silk, and cotton clothes on Aliexpress. If you search cashmere sweaters, or 100% cashmere to avoid a poorer blend that should return results. Look for the stores that carry items in basics and multiple colors. Like the store menca sheep official store. I’ve seen a variety of direct factory stores. If they have the name cashmere quality, high quality wool, etc in their name and stock exclusively those items, those are the good stores.   I’ve seen thick cotton t shirts too. The web store Inman has a brand store with most items cotton,or linen. They have some nicer short sleeve blouses and skirts. For silk, I think the store suyadream has silk camis, bras, undies, summer wide leg pants, and leggings. Across aliexpress for stores if you search silk do have silk velvet, silk blouses, silk dresses (may need to buy a silk slip too) for nicer occasions.Theirs also silk scrunchies on Aliexpress if you search 100% silk scrunchies(not to be confused with satin in the search results).  I have also found mink fur scrunchies too. I have seen lambs wool coats, and fur scarves, fur coats-filter by price accordingly and be sure it’s not faux fur. Ive also come across cashmere knit gloves, cashmere beanies,leather gloves. Even silver emf clothing, grounding sheets, bedding for people sensitive to emf. Of course, with everything pm the store with your measurements if they don’t have a recommended size chart or clear measurements. As a word of caution everything leans smaller. I wear an American small top, but wear a large in Chinese sizing. Read the recommended size matrix or pm them.  I’ve also seen wool socks too, but I think the price is comparable to the Costco pack. You may wish to double check.  I know aliexpress is controversial but if you search for natural fibers on their platform and take your time to go to a good store and double check the fabric content in the description I’ve seen some really affordable natural fiber clothing. Their search isn’t really the best.  For linen, Loft carries some items that are really affordable and they have regular sales. Loft and loft outlet do have cotton items but you need to search 100% cotton. Gap also has basics too, and they lean more towards natural fibers. I also have seen really cute Etsy sellers with linen dresses.	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- November 04	labels:I have some odd measurements due to an athletic build - 5'8", 163 lbs, 44" chest, 50" shoulders, 30" waist. I have a couple suits that were purchased /fitted when I was 25-30 lbs heavier, but now I have a funeral on Saturday and no well fitting suit for the occasion. Granted I don't expect to find a well fitted suit for the occasion at this point, but at least a bit closer. What OTR suit brands /fits are worth looking at that provide a significant drop? Figuring suit separates for sure... Have a Men's Wearhouse and Brooks Brothers Factory near me, along with various other chains (Macy's, JCP, Marshall's, Van Heusen)- anything that can be recommended to help a man out? Figure whatever I get I'll get it tailored for a better fit later, but hoping I can get something that at least doesn't look I'm a kid that raided my dad's closet. Figuring under $200ish would be good for the jacket, I have a few pairs of CK pants that I can readily line up okay with a handful of suit colors.
text:Congrats on the weight loss and sorry to hear about the funeral. Is your suit's shoulders really off? You're probably better of wearing that than an off the rack jacket with no matching pants.  NEVER buy a black suit jacket as a separate without the corresponding pants.  And you don't have to wear a suit to the funeral. It's perfectly fine to wear a black dress shirt with black pants and black shoes.	labels:Thanks for the advice! The shoulders/sleeves are fairly off - arms relaxed at side the sleeve cuffs hang at just a half inch above my knuckles.  If I wasn't a pallbearer I would go with disregarding the full suit and dress as you noted, still might be my best option I think.  Well noted on the pants, my other suits are more of a charcoal and. I have been able to mix a little as I got fatter at one point and wore different pants, but what you say makes good sense - it'll clearly look like I don't match.	episode_done:True

text:FAQ: When shopping on a budget, what items have the highest point at which they reach diminishing returns?	labels:In my experience, lower quality at lower price points is most noticeable for outerwear, footwear, or knits (I guess because they all serve a functional purpose) and spending more tends to lead to a more noticeable improvement in quality up to a certain point. That's painting with a broad brush though... leather dress shoes and boots scale much better than sneakers or sandals, where mid-range options are going to be good enough for most people.  T-shirts, dress shirts, denim, and accessories in low-to-mid-range are generally good enough from a quality perspective IMO and I've only really paid more in those categories for a design I like rather than because I think I'm getting something higher quality. There's nothing wrong IMO with buying something because you like the way it looks even if a similar quality alternative exists at a lower price, but that's harder to do if you're shopping on a budget.  I'll also add that for all of the above, your dollar goes a lot farther if you're willing to shop used. Sites like Ebay, Grailed, reddit/styleforum B/S/T threads, etc. have made it a lot easier to buy preowned clothes without having to set foot into a thrift store.  TL;DR When shopping on a budget I'd focus first on having a high quality pair of shoes and jacket. Consider buying used clothes to stretch your budget further.
text:I'd say it goes Shoes > Coat/Jacket > Trousers/Jeans > Socks > Shirts > Underwear > Tshirts.  I'm not saying that you can get away with crappy tees but you can definitely find a tee for £10 that's better quality than some of the £80 ones. Favourite tees I've ever owned are Uniqlo U at around £13 and a JCrew washed pocket tee they did maybe 10 years ago that I bought in the US for $20.  If your coat and your shoes are good, you can generally get away with budget on everything else provided it fits. I do think people underestimate how much of a difference a quality pair of denim and good socks make though.	labels:Seconding socks. Good socks are life changing. I read on reddit years ago not to skimp on anything that gets between me and gravity. Tires, boots, mattress, and socks. I rarely wear shoes (boots only) so my socks are purely for personal comfort, and nothing beats a good pair of wool socks. Go darn tough or rag wool knit socks from someone like LL Bean, and learn to darn them, and you'll never go back.	episode_done:True

The cotton fabric used for the leggings (certified organic cotton jersey with 5% elasthane) is sturdy enough to keep their shape when lounging about, but still super comfy. and the cupro and viscose blend used for the trousers is sooooo soft and luxurious. They're a bit pricey, I know, but it's all made sustainably and fair. They also run an [etsy shop](https://www.etsy.com/shop/KOMANA), but with far less pieces.	episode_done:True
text:What are your favorite straight leg jeans?	labels:I just got my first pair of the Levis Wedgie Icon jean and I am.... deeply in love. I haven't felt this way about a pair of pants in years. They are perfect -- straight (but still a little tapered), hits at my ankle for length, high rise, rigid denim. I have them in the Charleston Stroll wash which is a pretty standard blue jean color, but I have already looked at getting them in a black or gray wash for winter. A+ would recommend.
text:Hey, do you find that they stretch out in the waist after wear?	labels:Yep, just like the below comment said, I would def size down with my next pair but I personally don't find the stretch horrible. They are wearable and comfy and hold their shape elsewhere, but just the waist seems to have loosened up a bit.	episode_done:True

text:How much was your most expensive fashion item and when or how often do you wear it?	labels:My most expensive items have all been high quality copies of items I have in low quality but wore out the wazoo.  For example, I knew I was ready to invest in some high end Chelsea boots when I found myself going through a cheap pair every year. Or to invest in a nice leather-looking jacket when I found myself grabbing mine 70% of the time I went out.  The expensive items were hard to wear at first, maybe on date nights or to a nicer event, but as I got more used to wearing them I wore them more often. I think it took me a hot year before I wore my Red Wings more than like once a month.   My recommendation is keep the items in your comfort zone (so no wild dresses or Colors at first) and to force yourself to wear it at a regular interval. These days, just wearing nice jeans while I go shopping seems to be my “date night” when I dress up!

text:What's the greatest length you've gone to obtain a much coveted fashion item?	labels:Three things - I am a singularly obsessive person and a lot of my obsessions came into fruition in the past year:  1. This [dress](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/f6/e9/07/f6e90785f9565f6e2c9fb619d85dbdf1.jpg) took me about two years to find. Pippa wore the [green version](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ddjbi2jW4AA4SOR?format=jpg&name=medium) to the Royal Wedding so by the time yours truly stumbled across the gold/navy version (totally independently I might add), it was long sold out in every variation and color. Plus it was originally $700 so I dunno if I could have truly afforded it at full price. Took me about two years of relentless E-bay searching until finally one in my size popped up for $150.  2. Several years ago I became obsessed with this sweater worn by Lee of Stylebee [here](https://mk0stylebee3ei84ymh2.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/SB_WorkWinterOutfits_L3_H.jpg), [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/stateless-www-stylebee-ca/2020/01/SB_WorkWinterOutfits_L3_F.jpg), and [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/stateless-www-stylebee-ca/2020/01/SB_WorkWinterOutfits_L3_I.jpg). This sweater actually introduced me to Stylebee. I first saw it on an random Pinterest board, no link or source provided, and stalked it down the black hole of the internet until I found her instagram. Then read through all of her instagram and then all of her blog until I found the name of the sweater (Esby Quinn in butterscotch). By the time I found it, it was already a year out of season and sold out online. Then shock and surprise, I called every single local boutique in Minneapolis I knew that stocked Esby and [one!](https://www.shophazelandrose.com/products/quinn-sweater-iron-1) had one that was a return. It was in the blue grey color (“Iron”) when I really wanted the butterscotch. But more unfortunately, the wool had snagged at a part in the middle and had all the hallmarks of a beginning hole. I did not make the purchase, but at least it was all not a waste of time because I confirmed that the size (S) was perfect for me. Flash-forward another year of searching - every few weeks I’d type “Esby Quinn sweater” in google and admire from a far. Over time, the search turned up more and more irrelevant images as links were removed and webpages purged. In early November of 2020,  the [butterscotch in size s](https://poshmark.com/listing/Esby-Quinn-Sweater-in-Butterscotch-5f960d05e107bb78dcfc7bb2) finally turned up on Poshmark!  3. This one was actually pretty recent and didn't take very long (only a few months) but the intensity of my obsession makes up for it. I watched It's Okay Not To Be Okay on Netflix during quarantine and became obsessed with [this dress](https://images.summitmedia-digital.com/preview/images/2020/07/29/seo-ye-ji-lbd-aliceandolivia.jpg). I had 0 success searching for it myself ("Victorian Floral Dress" pulls up legit authentic olden day gowns). Finally, some blog from the Philippines (I am not Filipina, don't live in the Philippines, dunno how I came across it) IDed the dress. Again, totally sold out except for like $1,200 on Farfetch due to some heinously inflated price tag (same number but £ instead of $) and import duties etc. and not even in my size. And then THAT sold out. And then I was really in a slump - like looking for similar fabrics maybe to get one made for me, and then I clicked some random facebook ad for an Alice & Olivia sale on top of sale and viola, there was one - must have been a return. I think it was around $200... I don't know, I paid so fast, I think the numbers just blurred in my vision.   Sorry for the long post, but I don't actually buy a lot of clothes, but when I really really like something I must have it, and this question totallyyy speaks to me.
text:Impressive persistence; I usually get bored of the hunt before I find what I was looking for. Did all three items live up to your expectations once you finally got them?	labels:Yes!

text:What inspired your passion/love for fashion?	labels:As far as creating outfits for myself---I think it had to do being uncomfortable with my weight and skin (I had normal acne, but I scar really easily, so I have "shadows" of where pimples used to be years later...) and just never really feeling "pretty." So I'd try to put together outfits that maybe were interesting or looked polished, because I knew (or at least firmly believed) that **I** was/am not interesting and polished. I "knew" that no one would ever compliment or be attracted to me, so maybe I could trick them into noticing my outfit at least...I don't know. I think in a lot of ways I've come pretty far in this area, but I definitely still use clothes as a kind of armor almost. Like, don't repeat outfits and don't wear what other people have and don't do the expected combinations and all of that are hard habits to break, especially since I *do* get complimented/validated regarding clothing and not so much about my body, so I get caught in the mind trap of it all. It's gross and I'm still struggling a lot of days...  As far as fashion in general--I think watching Project Runway! It spurred me to find other fashion shows and documentaries and things of that nature. I love the creative minds behind the shows. I'm less interested in the final product, but just hearing how people, especially on a show like Project Runway, are inspired and (pardon the reference) make it work with so many limitations the show throws at them...it's so fascinating. I'm equally enthralled by cooking shows, where they have such knowledge and talent to do the seemingly impossible.	episode_done:True

text:Review your winter 2020/2021 outerwear: how did your coats and sweaters hold up this season? Would you recommend your specific brand to someone looking for warm layers. Did you add anything new to your winter wardrobe that stands out?	labels:A few years ago I got a pair of winter boots with fuzzy faux fur lining. Last year it didn’t snow enough to use them, but recently we had a huge snowstorm so I pulled them out again. They were filled with mouse poop :( It’s horrible and disgusting and I vacuumed them, but I feel like there’s really no way to fix this. The boots have to be thrown away. And I don’t have another pair of shoes I can wear when there’s a lot of snow and slush, so I’m stuck inside until the sidewalks are cleared.    I won’t ever buy (faux) fur-lined boots again. When I can go out again, I’m going to get a style that doesn’t look like an inviting mouse nest.
text:Oh no! I’m so sorry to hear that, I never even considered that when buying boots. Is there any way to fix them by filling them with something that can absorb the smell and then be dumped. I’m having trouble thinking of the name, but I know some guys who do that with heavy tall  work boots that can’t really be cleaned otherwise. I’ll google and look for it, unless I’m crazy and misremembering	labels:Baking soda can absorb the smell but I’d think anything grainy would be hard to get all the way out of the lining if it’s furry/fuzzy. I know it’s one of the suggestions I’ve seen for sneakers. If they are already headed for the bin throw them in the wash with just a tiny bit of detergent and air dry. They may not survive the wash but they might? If they are a loss anyway it may be worth a shot. I had an ‘underground’ (split level house)  bedroom for awhile and lost a ton of shoes and a few purses to mold... we had a moisture problem we weren’t aware of until it was too late. Ended up having to pull up carpet and replace a lot of things. I always store purses and out of season shoes in plastic bins with lids now.	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 27, 2020	labels:Might comment this a few times.   As I begin to refine my wardrobe I do ofc love a slim fitting pair of pants but am starting to fall out with the low rise/below the waist fit. I have a few relax fit vintage jeans and pants that have a more at waist/above waist fit that I’m falling in love with. I plan on taking these baggier pants to a tailor so I could have both the higher waist and slimmer cut.   What I was wondering is - are there brands that currently already do/have done this?! I don’t know how to search for what it is I like and I assume this may also involve terms I don’t entirely know much about such as “seat, rise”, terms that I see while looking at more vintage woman’s jeans which more or less have this kind of fit lol.  Hopefully I made some sense :| !
text:Rise is the distance from crotch to upper hem of pants. That determines high rise vs low riders.  Tailoring is the best bet if you want slim otherwise.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:2020 Gift Megathread	labels:It gets a little chilly in our house during the day and my husband mentioned that he wants some kind of wrist warmer/fingerless glove for his hands when he’s working or gaming. Any suggestions? I see a lot on Etsy but it’s mostly chunky knit stuff and seems like it wills be hard to type in.
text:I suggest a USB rechargeable hand warmer.   Depending on the type of games he plays, gloves might not be the best since it will interfere with the way he grips his mouse.   A space heater on his desk might occupy too much space and there's some concern with exposing plastic peripherals in front of heating elements. (Unless it's a space heater for his office/gaming area in general not just on his desk for his hands).  You can also look at friction free sleeves, too. One of my gaming friends swears by them.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:When did skinny jeans go out of fashion?	labels:I distinctly remember ten years ago wondering how fashion would change in the next 5-10 years. I grew up when the low rise boot cut jean was popular and was happy when the trend shifted for a higher rise and skinnier fit (no more wet hems and butt cracks)! The looser jean trends I’m seeing now I’m also liking - the ones I’ve tried actually feel much more comfortable than the skinnies I’m used to. I’m curious now how the trends will change again in a decade.	episode_done:True
text:Favorite Etsy Shops/thrift accounts?	labels:I bought some vintage clothes from [NorthernGirlStore](https://www.etsy.com/shop/NorthernGirlStore) and [MarmaladeVintageCo](https://www.etsy.com/shop/MarmaladeVintageCo) this summer. All the pieces I got were in excellent condition, and the measurements were quite accurate (except for one dress from Northern Girl was a little big bigger than expected.) Anyway, both shops have a large selection, mostly leaning towards 90s/grunge, but with other styles as well, and I recommend both of them.	episode_done:True

No one gets spooked by the image of a pre-showered girl in ugly socks pulled up past her ankles, even if she is see through. My presence is announced with the scent of fresh oven chips.

Nearly at drafting stage for project 1, and getting a research assistant on project 2. Which is... a new experience.  Also Lockdown 2: Electric Boogaloo in England.

text:I h8 Windows laptops.  They're so fucking finnicky and hard as hell to repair when they inevitably have shit that goes wrong.	labels:Tell me about it.

One thing I noticed just now is that the Google preview for the item I bought shows 2.5 stars and their site shows 4.9 stars for the same item. Hmmmm.	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 06, 2020	labels:How the hell do you keep your legs warm in winter? I've moved to a place with an ungodly cold winter (even though from what people are telling me this winter has been quite mild) from a place with only hot-or-warm-entire-years and the only thing I've been able to think about the past week is: how the hell do people keep their legs warm without looking dumb? Any sort of fashion or even barely nice looking thing I wear seems to let breeze in like a fucking skirt while I'm outside. Are long johns a thing people actually wear and not just a thing in old assed shows that have a winter fishing scene? If you're hooking up with someone and have to take off your long johns, that won't be something that gets you laughed at by society as a whole (or spread a rumour that you're a mormon)? Are there winter coats but, like, skirt winter coats I can wear over my legs? How do people do this...
text:2 ways to approach winter pants to stay warm.   1) Leggins/Long-Johns - They are ABSOLUTELY a thing in cold places and no one will think twice about it. Wear them under jeans/denim, and other lighter materials like cotton/chinos.   &#x200B;  2) Better Fabrics and Materials - There are a lot of options for fabrics that are better for cold weather in fall and winter. Wool is an option, which you can get in 100% wool for true warmth or in poly-blends which aren't as itchy. Moleskin and corduroy  are thicker cotton fabrics that are also great for warmth.   Examples, but you can find these fabrics in pretty much any budget:  [https://universalworks.co.uk/products/universal-works-aston-pant-in-charcoal-wool-marl-ii](https://universalworks.co.uk/products/universal-works-aston-pant-in-charcoal-wool-marl-ii)  [https://universalworks.co.uk/search?type=product&q=Moleskin](https://universalworks.co.uk/search?type=product&q=Moleskin)  [https://www.alexmill.com/collections/mens-pants-shorts/products/rugged-cord-pleated-pant-long-inseam-in-dark-navy](https://www.alexmill.com/collections/mens-pants-shorts/products/rugged-cord-pleated-pant-long-inseam-in-dark-navy)  Source: Growing up in the Midwest and 5 years in Boston for school.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Post-Baby Problems I Wish Someone Had Warned Me About	labels:Great post. I have 4 kids and didn’t experience most of this, but experienced plenty of other unexpected bodily changes.  Here’s my quick list as it relates to fashion:  -can’t wear heels anymore. My center of gravity is weirdly off. I expected bigger feet, which didn’t happen- just this.  -my youngest child is 7 and my nipples still poke out all the time. Aggressive nipples is a good term, I need a padded bra just to cover them up!   - hips are definitely wider/ differently shaped. I got down to my 18 y/o weight a couple years ago after a few months of inadvertent weight loss due to extreme stress, and tried on some old clothes and it became very obvious my  butt got flatter and my hips were wider.   For those wondering the damage was done with my first pregnancy, and I didn’t notice any additional or worsening  changes with subsequent births.

text:What did your mom teach you about fashion/style - and what did she not teach you?	labels:My mum taught me about natural fibers/good construction, and that thrift and consignment shops are awesome. I love my personal style and my wardrobe is precious now, and I really enjoy getting dressed.  I  wish she'd taught me about personal style, or encouraged me to dress in ways that made me happy.   In high school, I was a nerd with low self-esteem, not entirely un-cute though stuck on that late-90s American Eagle/preppy look. For academic decathlon state finals, she bought me a new outfit from, like, a lady store -- something very professional, black ponte pants and a nice sweater. The academic decathlon boys stared at me because everything was fitted, and I felt way too mature and inauthentic.   I can't remember the name of that Danish street style blog that used to interview subjects about their outfits -- but I always admired how many high schoolers were able to express their  unique personal styles. Massachusetts, USA in the late 90s was not that kind of culture!	episode_done:True
text:What did your mom teach you about fashion/style - and what did she not teach you?	labels:My mom taught me the "Choose One Thing" rule for classy occasions. That is, choose one area of your body to show off at a time to balance things out. For example, it might be overkill if you were showing off a ton of your cleavage AND all of your legs in the same outfit. Of course this doesn't apply to all situations, but it definitely saved me from looking a certain way at a few high end events.	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 24, 2020	labels:I'm a longtime lurker and browse this subreddit periodically. Maybe this is just me, but I recently noticed that the subreddit is become more fashion oriented and it doesn't seem to cater towards the average male. A lot of the outfits/lookbooks that are posted give me "fashion week" vibes because it has something vintage, baggy pants, some obscure sweater, etc.  I'm not hating on the subreddit because I respect fashion but the subreddit doesn't seem to be what it was 5 years ago. Basically, I feel that the subreddit is less helpful to the average male.  Points of discussion: What do you all think about the subreddit?  Anyone have an recommendations to subreddits/resources with current fashion advice for the average male?  Some of the information on the side or in the wiki seem a bit outdates. How can we better help newcomers?
text:I'm fairly new to this subreddit, but I've been lurking pretty consistently for about 6 months. I actually think it's a good thing that the sub stopped giving one-size-fits-all advice, because everyone is different and not everything works for everyone.  I've found it a lot more useful to try and develop a sense for what you personally like, and looking for that specific look (both inside and outside this sub). It's harder and more time intensive, but it's also more useful.   A few tips (that seem to work for me):  1:  look at basically anything that gets posted. WAYWT, new inspo albums, even runway stuff. You won't love every look (or most looks), but something's bound to be for you.  2:  find brands that you like and look through their old lookbooks, similar brands etc. It's completely okay to just recreate looks that you like.  3:  if you already have a certain style in mind, look through old inspo albums that fit, or find a consistent contributor on MFA that you like and look at their stuff. If you already like a look, keep searching for inspo!  4:  if you have questions, no matter how basic, ask in the Daily Questions, that's what it's for. Try and engage with the sub and it'll be a lot more helpful.  5:  have patience. You won't be a style icon in a week.  There's probably a lot more that I can't currently remember, but I hope it helps!  Cheers	labels:Sounds like someone who’s gone through the sidebar, good stuff.

text:what are wardrobe items you own that you absolutely recommend to everyone else here?	labels:Black jeans. All my outfits revolve around black jeans. I have 5 pairs that I cycle through. I wear different pants only when I'm exercising or wearing a suit. Funny enough, I also have one pair of dark blue jeans that I wear to nice restaurants that pair with a black blazer (black blazer + black jeans may be too much).  Also trucker jackets. I have three suede trucker jackets and two denim jackets. I get complimented pretty often (pre-COVID) when I wear these jackets. They're incredibly comfortable, durable, and stylish.

text:Handbag conundrum: lesser know (and lesser seen all over the place) or standard luxury designer bags (think the usual Gucci, YSL, LV, etc.)	labels:I think the best bag, and the one that is really worth it, is the one you like. If you don't like the look and feel of common luxury brands, get the lesser known brand. Buy what you will use and what will make you happy.
text:You’re definitely right, I just think I won’t know if a luxury bag will make me happy until I actually finally own one. For now it’s like chasing a dream I’ve never been able to attain on my own before and idk if it’s achieving the dream or the actual bag that I want.	labels:I definitely know this feeling, but it sounded like you weren't all that impressed by the quality of the  luxury bags when you went to look at them.  Maybe think of it like this as a test to see if it's the bag or the achievement of a milestone. If this bag (luxury or not) was found in a thrift store, and you couldn't find it in the store of the brand or online, and you left the thrift store without it, would you be worried that someone else would buy it before you? Or would you have a feeling of "meh, I'll find something similar?" If you would be worried about missing out on it forever, you want the bag.   You could also buy the super pricey Prada (or what ever luxury brand) and if having actually bought it feels wrong, you could return it.  But I totally understand wanting to have tangible reoresentations of the milestones you hit in life. Mine is one day being a home owner and not just a renter, and I really get excited at the thought of finding a space (not necessarily big, beautiful, or expensive) and making it mine.	episode_done:True

text:Post-Baby Problems I Wish Someone Had Warned Me About	labels:By about a year after my daughter was born I was more or less the same size and shape as I was prepregnancy, but throughout that year, I definitely needed to supplement my wardrobe with in-between clothes that weren’t my maternity wear and weren’t my regular size. I felt bad buying stuff for those middle months, but it was completely unavoidable.  The hormone thing though? That’s REAL! I never had real acne or bad skin pre-baby. Post-baby, ugh. Horrible cystic acne that was so painful and terrible and puffy. Eventually I had to get a dermatologist, get on prescriptions, and even get laser treatment to bring it back (which luckily we had some savings and my husband and I decided it was definitely worth the money just for my mental state) and I still have some scarring. Now, I’m pregnant with baby number two and the acne is starting to come back. How does this apply to fashion? It makes you appreciate makeup and spurn the “natural” look  that focuses on perfect, smooth skin you can’t really pull off easily anymore.

I looked them up after the fact and saw they were a Canadian brand, and had a video on their website of a guy demonstrating literally 30+ ways of wearing the hat, all with creative and clever names of each "style" of wearing it.

text:When/why did you get your first really fancy purse/bag?	labels:I have gone through a hellish 2020 - I moved across the country, separated/am in the middle of a divorce, quit drinking alcohol (I'm sober six months!), didn't get the promotion I wanted (stupidly my fault, was too depressed/distracted to apply), never mind COVID and all that comes with that.  I am trying to be kind to myself despite it all, and I am saving for my first luxury designer bag! I have owned mid-tier level bags like Coach, Dooney and Bourke, etc. but I think my first real luxury bag will be the Louis Vuitton Speedy 30 (classic). I'm still deciding if I will give it to myself as a Christmas present :) I'm in my late twenties and I think it is a classic enough style that I will still like it even as I get older. I also like that it can be dressed up or down - I've seen pictures of people wearing it with dresses and heels, as well as with sweats and a tee-shirt, and it looks good either way. Some people even bring it to work!

text:Does anyone else not factor in pants when creating outfits? How to move away from this?	labels:As someone who LOVES pants and has a problem with buying any patterned pants I see...  Other people have suggested black jeans which is great, they go with anything. I would add white to that, as well as dark/light wash jeans. There’s also the earth tones like khaki and beige that I find work with a lot of colors, and they are a neutral that people can overlook.   For really branching out though, I suggest basing it on the colors of your wardrobe. Consider the colors you most often wear. For example, I wear a lot of jewel tones, which look great paired with olive green, so I bought some olive green pants. another color suggestion for jewel tones would be something like burgundy. If you wear more pastel colors, I often see baby pink/dusty pink pants being sold, and that could look really lovely paired with lilacs, sky blues, and whites.  Another thing to consider is silhouettes you like. Personally I don’t venture too far out of high waisted skinny pants silhouette, but it does help me narrow down what pants to purchase. Maybe take a look at the jeans you have and decide if you really like the silhouette, try out other pants with that style, or venturing out into different cuts of jeans/pants and seeing how that matches with your wardrobe.

Once I got the ASKET t-shirts though I did do a short review on here because I was so happy with them.   Though, one big PSA - in my experience (and this may have changed over the years) different colors are slightly different sizing wise. For me, this is not an issue because I think at first I bought a green, maroon, black, and blue t-shirt just to see the colors they have, and the maroon color was significantly smaller than the other three.   Now I think I have six black t-shirts and six blue ones, and those are pretty much identical size wise.	episode_done:True

Different types of cardigans, with varying lengths, colors, buttons/no buttons etc. I have kimonos now too since they have been in style the last few years.   Focus on aspects of your body that you love and choose clothes that enhance your charms. I love my boobs and my butt so I look for clothes that hugs them.   I admire my friends who wear blouses. I never seem to get it right with blouses. So I just look at what everyone else is wearing (in the real world around me, it can be my coworkers or my students-some dress so beautifully), and imitate their style.   My most fashionable coworker ever is a beautiful woman who was 4 feet 11 inches and weighed about 250lbs. She taught me that size doesn’t matter. Her beauty, confidence, and grace inspire me to try bold looks. She is my fashion icon. Lol. Why am I telling you this? To inspire you to find a real life fashion icon too, so you can imitate their style until you find your own.   Good luck OP! I hope some of those ideas help you.

text:Women with ADHD & Sensory Processing Disorder: I need Clothing recs!	labels:I was just thinking about this the other day because i feel like I have cracked the code! Maybe I'll do a whole post sometime. I'm also in the cusp/extended sizing realm of things.  Caveat - i only buy second hand, generally from ThredUp.   Favorite brands:  J.Jill and PureJill. I hear they have good sales if you prefer to buy new. Most items dont have tags at all, a LOT of 100% cotton items, and things are soft and loose in the best way. Partly because all sizes run half to a full size large.    Max Studio runs smaller, but they also have some extremely soft fabrics, and they have really good options for those tight skirts that you can wear with leggings and loose tops.    Eddie Bauer runs fairly large, very few synthetic blends, easy to find super duper cheap second hand.    More generally, I look at fabric content. Usually with my trusted brands and ALWAYS with anywhere new.  I find that the closer I get to 100% cotton or cashmere for things that Im wearing next to my skin (tops and dresses and sleep clothes) the more I go to that item over the long term.    I also like Aerie for underwear and leggings. A lot of seamless options and breathable fabrics.    And finally - sending so much love to my sensory sensitive ladies! I'm really glad this got posted and has had so much engagement.	episode_done:True

I have so much navy and olive in outerwear that I really don't need anything more in that color, so I was looking for something in either gray or a lighter khaki/beige color.    Here are my choices.  I know they are pretty dramatically different, but wanted to get MFA's opinion.  The Harrington would be more versitile and I'd be able to use it for business casual/business formal when necessary, but the field jacket looks awesome and I absolutely love moleskin.  I know there's a dramatic price difference between the two, but am interested in opinions before I buy:  [https://www.privatewhitevc.com/products/ventile-harrington?variant=32078253686845](https://www.privatewhitevc.com/products/ventile-harrington?variant=32078253686845)  [https://www.weargustin.com/store/jackets-moleskin-field-jacket-warm-grey](https://www.weargustin.com/store/jackets-moleskin-field-jacket-warm-grey)
text:PWVC Harrington is a safe choice, but is *really really expensive* for what amounts to a very basic piece and as a result I'd probably lean towards the field jacket.

text:Looking for aesthetically pleasing pajamas	labels:Target's brand Stars Above have great items. I purchased a satin jogger and cami set that I absolutely adore. They have a super soft gown on sale for $16 right now. You can't really go wrong with Stars Above. Their fabrics are super soft and comfortable to sleep in.

text:What do YOU do with "chub rub" jeans?	labels:I reinforce them with an iron on while they're still in tact. Then I get them sewn as well to reinforce them that way. It costs about a tenner at a seamstress. I could probably do it myself but she does an amazing job and the thread is always a perfect colour match.  It gives me an extra while with my jeans, otherwise they only last me ~6months to 1 year.  I mostly wear skirts and dresses though.	episode_done:True

text:I liked their press ons when I used to be able to buy them other stores like Nordstrom’s and (I believe) Sephora.   However, I find their direct customer service to be absolutely horrendous. I preordered a few items back in March and the pages/cart had preorder ship dates and it was reflected in my cart on the checkout page (I generally take screenshots for my own reference). The specified ship date came and past... all I had from them was a series of generic emails saying that nothing was delayed, I just didn’t remember the preorder ship date - followed by a list of ship dates that did not line up what I’ve originally been told. Given posts on their social media around that time my experience was not unique.   I can understand delays, especially right now... what I can’t understand is brazenly and unapologetically lying to your customers instead of being straight forward about delays occurring. I really hope they learned a lesson about customer support and loyalty earlier this year.	labels:I hope they’ve improved since!

text:Winter jackets that are good for skiing and casual use?	labels:Dont go crazy on a jacket.  The key for skiing is layers and you can get a lot of layers that work well in other settings.   A decent base layer:  you can go merino or if you are on a budget milsurp poly pro.  A fleece over that.  Next layer is a beefier jacket.  Right now I have a half zip Patagonia that is poly insulated.  Then get a waterproof(ish) layer.  You have a lot of options but I usually run with a marmot precip.  It's cheap, has pit zips and folds up way smaller than a hard shell. That combo will cover you skiing 90%of the time and let you adjust depending o N conditions. Flexibility is the key.  Take the money you save and get some good socks and gloves/mittens and some type of balaclava.  No one ever came off of the mountain because their chest was cold but it was their hands/feet/face.
text:What Patagonia jacket are you talking about? Thanks!	labels:I am not sure of the model but it is a pullover that has a half zip allowing good thermo regulation.  It is poly filled so it maintains decent insulation even when wet.  And it packs fairly small into its pouch.	episode_done:True

text:Yep, I also have this same issue. I literally pick up whatever pants are strewn across the floor and then go grab a top that somewhat matches the bottoms. I also have this thing where in the evening, I imagine all these cool outfits that highlight my style and utilize all the shit I've bought trying to curate my wardrobe. However, when morning comes, I just want to be comfortable and wearing the leather mini-skirt with the 4" heeled booties I imagined the night before sounds unbearable. If I didn't have to adhere to at least a business casual dress code at work, I'd probably wear leggings and massive sweatshirts everyday.	labels:This is why I used to love packing for a business trip, because I'd plan every day's outfits (and throw in a few extra black things, because.)	episode_done:True

text:Is this the same cut in 2 colors?  I'd recommend trying to go up a size, and see how that looks and feels.    What I am seeing -     Some sleeve dimpling near the shoulder seam - left sleeve not hanging freely, which is likely distortion occurring because of lack of room elsewhere. Rear shots - back of coat looks very tight Length - sleeves could use a bit more length, more so on your right sleeve. Coat length is ok, but you may benefit from more length Pants - almost slim enough that they are sitting on your calves instead of hanging cleanly from the waist.  So, I'd recommend trying up a size versus this in a long, as I think trying both more width and length might be useful	labels:	episode_done:True

Some lines I can recall from the ad being things like, “Learn to dance, wildly and out of control.” “Get a book. Print is back in fashion.” And, “Exercise. A body in motion keeps the mind in motion.” Or something similar (clearly, I don’t exercise enough lol).

text:Conferences. Idk what you do for a living but look up if there are conferences related to your job or your company anywhere nearby or if there are conferences your company will send you to. My industry has 2-3 major conferences a year plus regional conferences, and then there's interest groups which also throw multi-industry conferences (like the society of women engineers as an example). Most companies in the industry will pay for you to go to at least one "away" conference a year and there are so many conferences in places where things are headquartered that most people get to go to two -- one "home" and one "away" So during non-pandemic times I can go to about 2 major conferences a year and each of those has business attire all day and multiple evening events ranging from cocktail to black tie attire and sometimes wierd themed events that are super fun to find outfits for. They're also lots of fun outside of dressing up and you can make some great contacts for career development.	labels:You and I go to very different conferences!

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- November 08	labels: Assuming budget is not a factor and temp/climate is appropriate (ie spring/fall/winter), is there any reason to choose cotton over wool for everyday wear? I guess what I'm getting at is, after finding out about merino, I'm wondering why I would buy cotton going forward. Merino is anti-stink, temp regulating, handles moisture and precipitation well, and doesn't need to be washed much. Cotton needs to be washed every other wear, doesn't regulate body temp well, absorbs moisture, but at least is easy to wash and is cheaper.  I guess what I'm getting at is, if I want to build a simpler, more sustainable and higher quality wardrobe, why wouldn't I choose wool (from brands like Outlier, Wool & Prince, etc)? The main reasons I can think of are that if it's hot in the summer, merino might be a little warm. Also since I have a kid, vom and other accidents occur - with a cotton shirt, that just washes right out.  Anything else I'm not thinking of, or reasons you wouldn't totally convert to merino or other wool fabrics?

text:Fashion "fantasies" coming true years later?	labels:Back in 2006, Target did a collaboration collection with Luella Bartley. I bought almost everything from the collection because I *loved* Luella and as a little teenage alternative kid pre-e-commerce boom, it was awesome to have things like that become so accessible at my local Target. However, many of [the ads](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ef/64/d0/ef64d0c548094e0b2a04050f25ffb63b.jpg) depicted a [green tartan taffeta party dress](https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/1Ylmg-xOUvJ0HzlS178QbTVI_c4/fit-in/2048xorig/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2011/02/07/2/192/1922564/27393cf817814d12_Look3bb/i/Luella-Bartley-January-2006.jpg) that I coveted and wanted *so badly* but was never able to find in a Target store.   The Luella collection came and went, I never stopped thinking about that dress, and even have an ad saved out of a physical magazine because it shows the dress. It's not really my style anymore honestly; taffeta is gaudier than I like even for nights out, and the drop waist and bubble hem feel dated. But I continued to spite-search for it off and on for the next decade and a half on ebay and poshmark until by chance, in late 2019, one showed up in one of my local charity thrift shops in my size for $5. I snatched that thing up so fast!!  I haven't worn it yet. I might not ever wear it (except to a 2000s event at a nightclub or something lmao), but I'm not ready to let it go yet simply because it sits in my closet like a trophy after all the years I spent looking for it out of desire and then eventually out of frustration and spite. I haven't fixated on anything quite like that dress before or since, even in my niche fashion communities where "collector mentality" is much more of a thing. When I upsize I might hang it up on the wall staged as decor [like I've seen people do on pinterest](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/7e/e6/e0/7ee6e08a34a2e8fbae898c019c3263f2.jpg).

text:Women with ADHD & Sensory Processing Disorder: I need Clothing recs!	labels:I feel this. Comfort is so extremely important to me in clothing. My sensory issues have gotten way better as an adult, but when I was a kid I couldn't stand the feeling of anything that wasn't 100% cotton.   I often jokingly describe my personal aesthetic as "business casual pajamas". I wear lots of blazers and dress pants, but also jumpsuits and dresses. I really like pieces that have some structure and can easily be dressed up or down, but are soft and comfortable enough for lounging around the house.   I have a very strong preference for ponte and jersey knit clothing. Cotton or silk is great, but other fibers work as well - I find that these fabrics feel soft and comfortable in a variety of different fibers. I particularly like ponte because it is so comfortable but is thick enough to have some structure and drapes really beautifully. It's amazing for things like blazers and dress pants.  The other things I look for in clothes are influenced by a combination of aesthetics and comfort. I like wide leg pants, high-waisted bottoms, sleeveless tops (but no spaghetti straps), maxi dresses, things that wrap around me, dolman and kimono sleeves, plunging necklines, elastic waistbands that don't look like elastic waistbands, clothes without polyester or acetate linings, tops that don't ride up and exposed skin at my waist. Probably lots more stuff.   I also switched to wearing boxer briefs, which I find infinitely more comfortable than any other style of underwear. No panty lines, no riding up.   Oh, and I don't own a single pair of jeans and I don't plan to change that in the foreseeable future. I don't find denim comfortable at all.
text:I love 6 inch boxer briefs from TomboyX. They’re mid rise and really durable so far (been wearing them for over a year). Great addition to chilly weather in the fall, that & wool knee socks. When fall comes I tolerate jeans less because the cold changes my skin & relationship to jeans 🤷‍♀️  Their bikinis don’t crawl unless I have more glute muscle. If you have “violin” hips, underwear may crawl uncontrollably. This was me until I found them. Aerie boy briefs are also good. The lace waistband ones slip down on me too much, the thick cotton banded ones show too much VPL for my taste. If you don’t care, these can be awesome.  Edit: will to wool	labels:Yes, I am a huge fan of Tomboy underwear because they don’t bind and chafe!	episode_done:True

At the current price it is just too much for me to pay. I would be ok paying $800 for it but $1600 i can’t justify. Is there anything out there that is similar for a more reasonable price?  *also is it ever worth spending this much on one piece? This is something that I would wear forever so maybe it is worth.
text:Yeah. That's beautiful.  Obviously $1600 is a lot objectively for a Cardigan. But subjectively? Depends on your average purchase. If this is the first time dropping over 1k on a piece...I'd say check your wardrobe first and make sure you've already got lots of versatility. 1600 can buy a lot of versatility.  Also don't trick yourself into "I'll own it forever" as an excuse. Sure, you may, but styles change and so do our tastes and it's a poor argument unless you intend to never buy another cardigan again. Do you?  Ultimately, does it make you happy? Will it fuck up your finances? Is this just retail therapy? Those are the important questions.  Questions about quality are secondary to those.	labels:Great answer. I agree that the “ I will wear forever” is a trap. Thanks for pointing that out for me. I do not own a cardigan and I wanted something for the time I will spend in our family house in the mountains for our ski trips. I could afford this, but it is just hard to pay that much for clothing.	episode_done:True
text:What are some of your least favourite brands?	labels:Anything that's super overbranded or obnoxiously branded...Michael Kors, Calvin Klein, Levi's, Louis Vuitton, etc... the one exception that kinda gets away with it is Ralph Lauren, it still can be obnoxious though.

text:How much was your most expensive fashion item and when or how often do you wear it?	labels:Last year I started using a clothing organization app on my iPad to keep track of how much I paid for everything I bought and how often I wear it. Although I’ve always been tempted to spend more on special fancy dresses and things like that, what I found is that the things I wear most are sports bras, tennis shoes and other loungewear. (Esp. this year.) It’s really changed the way I allot my clothing budget. Although I do have a couple splashy items in my wardrobe, I now spend more money on things like workout wear and leather boots, rather than fancy silk dresses that would be ruined if you wore them every day. If I want something really fancy I look for it on sale or I try to buy it secondhand.   In a weird mental glitch, my comfort in wearing something I may spoil doesn’t depend on if I buy it on sale, for instance I have a $250 white sweater that I paid $30 for on clearance, and I still hesitate to wear it because I think it would cost $250 to *replace*.

text:What rules do you break for your body type?	labels:I don't know if this is an actual "rule" or not, but most of my friends growing up were super thin with little curves. I was always much curvier and was always jealous of how they could seemingly pull off anything and still look classy/fashionable. I always felt like if I wore similar clothes (like some examples listed here - turtlenecks/high neck shirts and also crop tops, deep v necks, bralettes in summer, etc) there was an instant , almost negative, sex appeal added and I was always pretty insecure.  Well probably around the time I graduated college, I just stopped caring. So what if a turtleneck accentuates my boobs? Who cares if I wear a crop top in summer when it's 100 degrees? I find that I'm still dressing pretty "young" in my late 20's because I was too insecure to feel comfortable in the styles when I was younger. But I'm having a great time!
text:Me too! I had really bad body dysmorphia in high school and wore baggy oversized clothes so no one could see my body.

text:What did people *actually* wear in 2000's?	labels:Low cut jeans or cargo pants with fitted shirts that had slogans on them- my two favourites were: "you're just jealous cos the little voices are talking to me"  And "Inside me is a thin woman trying to get out. I usually shut the bitch up with chocolate".  I didn't say I wore tasteful clothes.....	episode_done:True
text:How to shop ThredUp and avoid the junk?	labels:I only buy brands I know I like and I know my sizing in. Occasionally I will come across something that looks amazing from a brand I don't know, I will look it up and buy it if its a high quality brand. I generally stick to natural fibers, as polyester and rayon can be very hit or miss without feeling it. I don't buy anything with any damage. Thread up also has "premium" section but I find its kinda random what gets in there. You can also search by price >$10 and it will weed out a lot of junk.	episode_done:True

text:What's your fashion tragedy?	labels:Well, a tragedy for my wallet.

I convinced myself I would wear them every day in winter so it would be worth it.   Yeah... They're heavy and uncomfortable af after a while, and squeak horribly on wooden floors. I still feel so silly about buying them when I consider that, usually, comfortable is very high up my list of musts for clothing and shoes. I've worn them about four times in three years. Still need to try sell them online.   An effective lesson in taking a few days to consider expensive items I suppose 😬

text:Effortless style - let's exchange tips and tricks	labels:Deconstructing effortless for a second:  when someone looks at a photo of, say, a blogger or model—what compels the viewer to declare:  that's effortless?  Most photos are planned, styled, and selected often from a photo roll of hundreds of shots.  After that, they are typically edited or at the very least filtered before they land on your Instagram, Pinterest, Blogroll feed.  In other words, effortless style probably not indicate the work that went into the photograph itself.  It also probably does not denote the subject of the photograph, since most are professional dressers (influencers, bloggers, models, stylists, celebrities, etc.) to some extent.  So my theory is effortless is what the photo induces the ***viewer to feel;*** but is not in any way indicative of what it is actually like to be the subject of such a photo.     In other words, when I view a photo and I see an outfit I like that I could reasonably afford or mimic without a great deal of ado, I tend to think of that outfit as effortless.  It helps that I am also told that it is effortless in the caption, which reinforces the belief that such a look is reasonably within my grasp.  In fact, the word effortless is a common marketing ploy, used to induce a sense that everything could be just so easy--if you had one more thing.  In that sense, I think there's a reason why there's such a strong relationship between effortless dressing and luxury/premium goods.  Most people have got a white shirt, sneakers, and jeans; but most people do not have a Chanel classic flap.     It's the same kind of marketing ploy used to sell all manner of commodity.  Most famously, it was used to sell dishwashers and vacuums to housewives.  Basically, effortless is the belief that your life, your image, could be so leisurely if you bought just one more thing.  Of course, our lives have not gotten more leisurely since the 1950s, especially if you're American.  And of course, a vacuum doesn't eliminate the need for cleaning, it just makes it slightly easier--well, until the vacuum breaks or needs to be upgraded or you realize that in order for your carpets to be the gleaming white clouds of magazines, you also need to buy a steamer.     But going back to being the subject of the photograph.  What we most often find is that we are not able to look as effortless as the subjects because we don't live in photographs; and also, because we don't have all the time or energy or money to devote to our appearance as these professionals.  We might not be as attractive as them either--not as thin or tall or beautiful.  So then we go back to our closets and go:  why don't I feel effortless?  And the truth is effortless style is not effortless; it's a very specific kind of visual fiction that we're told we could inhabit.     If we tried hard enough.     After all, why do we say effortless and not comfortable or easy or simple or basic?  Why aren't Naturalizer shoes effortless?  Why aren't sports bras effortless?  Why aren't sweatpants effortless?  Pajamas?  When people talk about quarantine style, why aren't we calling it rather--effortless style?     Of course, if we wanted to assume the effortless style, we'd probably stock up on basics and then carry one reach item--something that is unusual, perhaps; or possibly, something that's expensive.  Your first photo has a woman lounging with a Louis Vuitton portfolio, the second has a girl in a bright pink dress, etc.  Things would have to be immaculately fitted by tailor for those of us who aren't 5'10 and mostly leg.  And we'd all rush to the local dermatologist, hair dresser, and Sephora to look like we'd done nothing to ourselves at all.  And then I think we'd all look about as close to effortless as money could buy.  After that, it'd all be up to the viewer of our photographs.

text:FAQ: What is the environmental impact of different fabrics?	labels:I think a proper answer to this question would require a research team, a lot of money, and a lot of time. Here's some top-level things I know about various fabrics/materials:  * Cotton requires a lot of water to become a fabric. Especially anything that's "washed" like non-raw denim. (See Levi's Water-less line) * Any synthetic fabrics are made from fancy plastic and release micro plastics into the water every time you wash them. Even the tees and fleeces that are made from recycled plastics. There are [bags](https://www.patagonia.com/product/guppyfriend-washing-bag/GP001.html) and filters you can buy which supposedly cut down on the amount of micro plastics that actually make it into the water supply. I can't speak at all to how effective they actually are.  * Leathers of any kind require a lot of water and various "chemicals" to tan. Vegetable tanning is generally regarded as ~~better~~ less bad than chrome tanned leathers. * The excuse that "leather is a by-product of the meat industry" is basically a dumb trick of economics and the definition of "by-product". Meat is a larger industry and is more popular than leather so cows that are raise are more or less called "angus/beef" cows instead of "leather" cows because most of the money in them comes from the meat and not the hides. Farmers still make money off of selling the hides and such. If everyone stopped eating beef overnight then leather would no longer a by-product it'd be the main product. Don't get sucked into this excuse. * Fabric treatments, in general, are "bad". Waterproofing, non-iron, etc. * Washing clothes is "bad". Similar to how the majority of the environmental footprint of combustion engine cars comes from after they're sold, a large part of the environmental footprint of clothing comes from once it reaches your house. More specifically when you wash your clothes. Lots of washers aren't high-efficiency and use a lot of water, more energy if you don't wash on cold, dryers use a ton of energy, etc.   Hopefully someone else can talk about wool. I personally know nothing about it.  This is all really surface-level takes and there's more than enough nuance to go around that I've avoided in this comment. As always, if your primary goal is to have a small environmental footprint, there's a reason the order is reduce, reuse, recycle. Buy less.

text:Brooks Brothers's Future Looks a Lot Like Menswear’s Past	labels:My first real suits and quality dress shirts came from Brooks Brothers two decades ago. I was about 24 and a friend told me I needed to go there. He was right - BB and their gatewat non-iron dress shirts changed how I will dress for work for the rest of my life.  Today's BB is pretty bloated with a lot of confusing crap lately.   Still, I'm rooting for them. I wish they could blend the technical expertise of Lululemon, the modern masculine wit of Todd Snyder, the tech and colors of Proper Cloth with the reliability and energy of early 2000s #menswear J Crew -- with a touch of Quoddy or Alden mystique, we'd really be going places.   BB made some pretty dowdy swings at ahthleisure. Why pay extra for Brooks Brothers fronting Nike and Lululemon, when you could just buy those brands?  There's a cool opportunity for Bastian and Co to help guys figure out what work clothes look like for 2030.  Respectful, modern, flattering, professional clothes for guys in a wide variety of sizes on the go from gym to school drop, from the home office to the city office and back.   They could also simplify pricing rather than offer $250 sweaters with a corporate club membership and points and discount codes. It feels like a lot of hype for nothing. Their sizes are also hard to understand on their hard to use website.  I have hope!  Brooks Brothers wool socks and older Alden for BB loafers are are some of my favorite things I own and will hopefully wear for the rest of my life.	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 29, 2020	labels:I'm 28 and after finally working up the courage to piss off my uber conservative country family and moving to Portland, I'm ditching carharts and wranger jeans, and am struggling to build my first set of clothes that I actually like and need help with shoes. I'm going for a very feminine/andro look and have a couple pairs of Levi 510 skinny jeans, some tight fitting v-neck shirts, and I just picked up a couple women's [open-front cardigans](https://www.gapfactory.com/browse/product.do?pid=5931600510002&cid=1172279&locale=en_US#pdp-page-content) that I think are amazing and unisex. I've also got some awesome bracelets and necklace.  I'm looking for some very feminine shoes to go with this set so that I can have a baseline to experiment from. I really like suede chelsea boots, but have trouble finding more feminine ones in men's sizes. Any tips or suggestions? Also, would it be a good idea to have my jeans shortened so that they don't have to get tucked or forced over the shoe? I have a very skinny frame if that helps. Looking for casual with ability to dress them up. Money isn't much of an issue but I'd prefer it to be less than $300.
text:Check out story et fall they have great slim Chelsea boots with a decent heel	labels:Echoing pe3brain ^  SEF is solid. Beckett Simonon toes the line between masculine chelsea silhouettes (e.g. RM Williams) and more feminine ones (Saint Laurent, Celine, FromTheFirst, Story et Fall). They take a while to ship, but small discount codes are common and the quality is decent for what you get.   There's also Meermin.   My first recommendation would be to check Grailed/eBay/Depop (in that order) for SEF or From The First boots.   I personally wouldn't shorten the jeans, but you could always experiment with a thrift store pair and do a cutoff / taper if you were into DIY. A strong taper with the jeans could also let them stack a little bit over the chelsea, but you typically need a narrow ankle opening to pull that off. One that pulls away from your foot a lot doesn't mesh well with the stacked look.

text:How do comfort vs. style compare in what bottoms you wear?	labels:I mostly wear jeans/pants and I find them to be very comfortable personally. I'm honestly always a little surprised that they're so uncomfortable for most people. Most of my discomfort in skirts/dresses is mental (I just don't feel like me when I wear them).   I think if you enjoy wearing skirts you should keep wearing them, nothing wrong with that. If it's a seasonal thing maybe fleece stockings or something like that will allow you to wear them in the cooler months.

Exude it, imho.
text:I love this, and this is how I think about it. I’m 32, and I don’t want to look like I’m playing dress up by following teen and 20-year-old trends too closely. But embracing current silhouettes doesn’t have to mean buying clothes straight from the teenage section. It’s all about drawing inspiration from trends and incorporating them in ways that suit my wardrobe and lifestyle.  TBH though covid has changed my feelings about some of this. I don’t ever see anyone I’m trying to impress anymore, and the person I spend all day every day with (my boyfriend) likes me most in the kind of outfits I would have worn to try to look hot in college. So I’ve been revisiting short skirts and tiny dresses and booty shorts and little crops and having a great old time.	labels:It's not just fashion. It's a lifestyle change for sure.  How you regard yourself and how you want others to regard you and whose regard you actually want changes over time.

text:Rant - I'm fed up with fashion and "expressing myself"	labels:This is my old person perspective (I'm 42).   I think at some point, most people end up picking a "look" and just wearing it - irrespective of trends or what other people think.  There is an adage about [fashion vs style](https://www.masterclass.com/articles/key-differences-between-fashion-and-style). And I think it is true.    I think for me, I sort of made up my mind on what style meant for me around age 20. It shifted and ebbed a little here and there, but directionally that choice I made then still holds true for me now in my 40s.  No matter what you choose to wear, it does say something about who you are. And I think now, especially in your current state of mind, it is a good time to draw a line in the sand about what you like to wear and what you don't like to wear and go with it.   You don't have to keep up with all the trends or the latest bag or whatever. And over time you'll be known for certain looks. And that is totally OK. You start coming into your own as you get older. Jump in now feet first. Sort out what you like and focus on that.
text:I'm in my 20s but I was fortunate to discover a "style" (or two) i loved early on.  FP style, vaporwave, and Lolita change. Yes. But the fashion is what it is. I could go buy a black OP from 20 years ago and it could still fit in with a kuro Lolita chord today. Do people get the latest AP releases to stay in fashion? Sure. But it's not necessary and most people don't d stress about the latest releases  While what's typical in vaporwave might change. The way of expressing yourself in the fashion doesn't. For a while pastel/ glitched nasa logos were THE popular thing. But that didn't mean that people weren't still going hard for sad boi anything and everything.

The fit of her sweats change as the fashion changes, but it's easy to keep your style and not have to stress.  Totally! I am a fan of skirts, dresses, and color blocking! I switch up the skirts as my mood or styles change. There was a knit jersey midi to ankle tube skirt phase, a knit pencil skirt phase, a structured pencil skirt phase. Now it is patterned skirts and midi skirts and pleated skirts. And instead of color blocking with brights, I swapped to color blocking with bright and pastel.   The biggest swap I have made was merging work and weekend. Since my office is casual, and as I got older I decided to dress up more for all occasions, because that felt more comfy. When I was younger I did more t-shirts and jeans on the weekend - but I always felt off in those silhouettes. Then that got scrapped and found work dresses I liked for weekend.	episode_done:True

text:Post-Baby Problems I Wish Someone Had Warned Me About	labels:Yes. Mom of 2, youngest is 6.  I have some other commentary (based on things I have told myself):  Regarding pre-baby clothes : throw them out (or donate). You don’t want to wear them. They are old. They will not make you feel good in your new body. You are older. You are a different person. Buy some new clothes that make you feel great because they fit. Move on with your life.   Ignore the number on the label. It means nothing. Find a good tailor - remember, you’re older now. You can get things tailored. You don’t need to buy Forever 21 anymore. And once the babies are in preschool and you’re not paying childcare anymore, you’ll have plenty of disposable income 🥴  Once the babes are done nursing, BUY NEW BRAS you will feel like a new woman.

Honestly I probably would have just thought, "Oh, I wonder if he's wearing socks," and that's about as much thought as I would give the whole situation. But, stylewise your outfit sounded on point, so if it concerns you that much, a pair of no show socks would work to alleviate some of the stress.

The names we use like blue, red and so on are fairly subjective to what the refer to and aren't absolute.

[Everlane](https://www.everlane.com/products/womens-weekend-tee-dress-cameopink) T-shirt dresses for grabbing coffee between webex calls.

Worst: This [dress](https://www.freepeople.com/shop/martine-mini-dress/) from free people. I got it for a very small socially distanced wedding and thought the green color would be more muted, but I just ended up looking like tinkerbell.

text:Cold weather friendly skirts and dresses	labels:Honestly, I find you don’t really need to prioritize your legs as far as keeping warm. Make sure your feet and core are nice and toasty and you should be fine.  I prefer natural fibers, so cotton, wool, silk. I really like wearing silk long underwear on really cold days, it’s super light and fits under anything, even tights.    Stay away from acrylic and polyester fleece.  That stuff is warm indoors but as soon as there is the slightest breeze, the wind goes right through it.
text:This is very true regarding keeping your feet and core warm. My winter jacket is very warm and goes to mid thigh, and my Sorel boots nearly reach my knee (I only wear them when its super cold/snowy), so the part of my leg that is "exposed" is actually pretty short. Even with extreme cold warnings and wind chills, fleece lined tights (maybe layered with a second pair) are enough for me.  Also!

text:Has anyone else ever tried on a designer item just to see what the hype is about?	labels:I remember once passing by the designer section at Winners (Canada’s TJ Max) and the silk sleeve of a Celine dress fluttered over my hand and seemed to wrap around. I had to stop. It felt otherworldly and magic- the fabric, the drape. Extraordinary! Probably another week and it would be tattered and dusty from falling on the floor and snagging on hangers 😱  I bet designer stuff in the middle range, like 500-800$, would just feel like normal clothes though.  I have a silk velvet robe from the 1930s that has that magical feel. It’s so strangely light and luxurious. Maybe I should pull it out for the next Zoom meeting...

According to their sizing chart, I'm a large if I go by my chest (42"), a medium if I go by the neck (15-15.5") or shoulders, and a small if I go by the waist (27-31").  In terms of Banana Republic's ***T-Shirts***, I'm always a medium.... but when it comes to their ***Sweaters***, a medium *starts off* fitting me okay, but if it shrinks even the *smallest* amount, becomes too small and too short. The thing is, a Large-sized sweater is too big, with the shoulder seam sitting too low on my delts, and the whole thing just being too big, unless I'm able to shrink the sweater a LOT.  Any help with this is appreciated. Regardless of what size I buy, I will do some of my own tailoring to bring the torso in, but ya.
text:Yeah unfortunately banana republic (esp their factory line) doesn't cater well to athletic/tapered builds. I'd go L if you plan on layering over a collared shirt or anything else underneath. Otherwise an M should fit similar to your tees.	labels:I tend not to layer my sweaters, and may just wear them over a Tshirt if I want the extra warmth. What I'm worried about is shrinkage though.... the mediums fit well, but if they shrink a bit, they dont. The larges, on the other hand, start of way ***too*** big.  And yeah I've noticed, but TBH I've never found a sweater line that IS for athletic builds... they're ALL sized to fit like our grandfathers' sweaters, it seems. That being said, I'll be tailoring these sweaters. Got any brands you can recommend around the same price point as Banana republic that are more athletic?	episode_done:True

text:Stay In-Vested	labels:> Basics are good. A lot of people here are basic.  > mfa_nay, 2019  **Vests as a layering piece**  Spinoff / last in the series of layering. This time around we are not talking about a midlayer. These vests are in the realm of workwear/ fall approppriate. Featured in the album is:  * Layered over top of hoodies/sweaters  * Quilted and down vests  * Worn with a lot of denim  For different kinds of vests see /u/tehoi's post on [Utility Vests](https://old.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/ie0dt5/utility_vests_how_to_engineer_your_garments/). Or I was recommended that  you look into Nicholas Daley for his vests.   **All of these outfits start to look the same**  That is a completely fair point. As I said a lot of this is iterations of similar things. This album is derived from the Top of albums and most upvoted outfits so this is more indicative of what MFA was wearing and what was liked.  **"My favorite vest inspiration did not make it into the album"**  Please feel free on posting it below, not everything made it into the album and these pictures are specifically from MFA posters, or I just missed it. Show people what you like and how you like it!  **That vest or those things on the dude in picture X are dope, what are they?**  To quickly find out what an item of clothing is, try using Google image search. It will usually take you to the original listing and most posters will list the items worn and/or you can PM wearer and ask them to tell you what they are wearing.  **Other resources:**  [Utility Vests: How to Engineer your Garments ](https://old.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/ie0dt5/utility_vests_how_to_engineer_your_garments/)  [The Utility Vest & Classic Menswear](https://old.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/iso4bi/the_utility_vest_classic_menswear/)   **Layering series**  [Hoodies as a layering piece](https://old.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/j6qj9d/hoodies_as_a_layering_piece/)  [Denim jackets as a layering piece](https://old.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/jfc9px/denim_jacket_as_a_layering_piece/?)

text:How do you shop at TJ Maxx/Marshall’s?	labels:I work at a TJ Maxx/HomeGoods combo store. We absolutely do not know what we are going to receive until we actually open the packages that come off of the trucks. At my store, we got like 10+ pairs of blue crocs, but literally only two pairs of white crocs.  And unlike most retail stores, we have buyers choosing which items to purchase every two weeks instead of monthly/quarterly. With that in mind, the best thing you can do is check in as much as possible. I'd say for every gem, we have about 200 decent items. Go during a weekday as soon as we open for the best chances as weekends are generally busy.   Also I agree about the Runway stores, I saw a Gucci purse like two years ago at a TJ Maxx with a Runway section in Scottsdale, AZ. (Also to my fellow Arizonans, the locations on Frank Lloyd Wright Blvd and Miller Rd have the best selection, in my opinion).

text:How much was your most expensive fashion item and when or how often do you wear it?	labels:Not counting formalwear, definitely coats. I pretty much live in wool overcoats from October to April. I've thrifted quite a few and bought others on sale, but I find things originally priced in the $250-$450 range are usually a decent bet. Last year I stumbled into a fantastic Aritzia sale and picked up a black-and-white houndstooth coat and a bright orange wrap coat for under $200 each—it was a splurge-y day, but I'll wear them both for many years. I'm hoping to find options in another bright colour (maybe apple green, sky blue or light purple) and dark red this year.  I would also pay this much for leather outerwear, trousers, bags or boots—but these are not things I purchase often. I am vaguely considering some black or burgundy leather straight-leg trousers this season, but with COVID I'm not sure sure there are enough opportunities to wear them.
text:I've got a hand-made tweed hacking jacket that bought in Edinburgh and refuse to translate the price on, and my winter coat is a Filson Seattle Cruiser that was in the $450 range.

I easily have 12+ coats, many over $400 and all 5+ years old and still in great condition. I choose classic shapes so I have no regrets and still wear a wool Hugo Boss jacket that’s 13 years old and get compliments regularly. I have enough coats for my and my children’s lifetimes.

I decided to keep two blazers (a classic lined one and a jersey drapy one) a few button ups for potential interviews/funerals/professional blah blah/but really to for a halloween costume 😂  I have a few pairs of jeans I make sure fit regularly because I'm in snow country and figure I should have some, two "dress up" dresses and then really dumped most of it.  I've been investing in my "home work" wear. Stretchy pants with pockets, tshirt dresses, wrap skirts, loads of black because I'm an artist and work with ink regularly.

text:Women with ADHD & Sensory Processing Disorder: I need Clothing recs!	labels:Whoa... I am an adult woman with ADHD and I never thought about this somehow. I have MAJOR issues with restrictive clothing. Winter coats feel like a straitjacket, turtlenecks \*literally\* made me vomit when I was younger, and anything that's even slightly itchy or makes a weird noise (like a swishy windbreaker) drives me insane. I can't wear bracelets or watches because the sound of them clicking on my desk grates against my soul.  I usually live in American Eagle jeggings (soft joggers as soon as I get home), comfortable shirts, soft and loose sweaters/cardigans, comfortable ankle boots/Converse, and sometimes a well-fitting skirt with tights.  Interestingly, I have no issue with wearing tights, which I know a lot of women find uncomfortable. I don't mind wearing a bra, either.
text:I have ADHD and the first time I heard someone describe it as “autism lite” I didn’t get it but uhhhh holy shit that is pretty accurate considering how many textures/sounds irrationally bother me (I CANNOT handle spongy foods like eggplant/mushrooms, I have pretty bad misophonia with chewing noises etc), and how helpful I find stim toys, etc etc	labels:I haven't got adhd but I'm under investigation ? Autism and the way that sounds and sensations bother me is really frustrating. Some artificial fabrics especially, scraping/rustling noises etc. Having a tv on in the background drives me mad!

text:Cool insights! Re fewer tall boots in economically uncertain times - is this because they tend to be quite expensive?	labels:Yeah! No one is spending $300 on a tall leather boot right now so it would be a huge margin loss. At least within my company. Instead, we are designing and also seeing a lot of other fashion brands going for a slightly taller shaft than a Chelsea.  Now this is a general statement. Company’s like Frye that are known for their boots this will be different but you can even tell from their website that tall boots aren’t selling.	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - November 30, 2020	labels:Some pretty amazing sales and discounts all around but I have, so far, managed to not give in to temptation. Partly because COVID is still an ongoing crisis and jobs security is, however remotely, an equally ongoing concern. Partly because I'm in the last year of my program and that was always going to be a time of instability and transition (try dissertating during a pandemic. I don't recommend it.).

text:Experience with fast fashion brands for office casual clothes (Shein, Fashion Nova, etc)?	labels:I occasionally buy clothes from Shein for fashion pieces when there's a trend I want to try and don't want to spend a chunk of change on it so this comment is specific to Shein. I understand the ethics behind buying fast fashion, I just don't have the ability to buy from sustainable brands all the time.  Truthfully I don't recommend buying from Shein if you're looking for something that you're going to wear more than one season. The clothes look great before you wash it, nice quality even, but they detoriate the moment you try to wash it. The fit is alright but the fabrics pill easily and the materials they use for the clothing photograph well (on the reviews) but are not comfortable. A lot of the clothes are very poorly made in materials that don't suit what the clothing is meant to do e.g. not stretchy loungepants.   My top tip is to read the reviews and try to look for photos in different body types to see how the clothing is actually cut. Stick to basics because it's hard to get wrong. Good luck!	episode_done:True

Contemplating getting long just to make sure that doesn’t happen?	labels:I’m 5’7” with longish legs and the regular length fits me perfectly. They’re long enough to hit the ankles and since I wear a large (175lbs) they bunch up juuuuust enough to give it a cute casual look. I’m just waiting on another pair of these in the burgundy colour and I’m obsessed with the crackle pair currently, but they have no pockets so they’ll be my ~fancy leggings lol.

text:2020 Gift Megathread	labels:Is there a functional difference between women's scarves and men's scarves? I'm looking for a relatively inexpensive cashmere (blend?) scarf for my boyfriend's brother. If I can find one within budget :'(
text:I like to think scarfs are relatively unisex, but there are some minor size differences depending on the style. Women tends to have more style, sizes and range. For example a classic rectangular scarf meant to be worn in a simple loop, the men version might be slightly wider & longer. Really depends since there's so much variables.    What is your budget?	labels:That makes sense. I figured there were some women's styles that wouldn't translate as well but that's helpful to know that generic rectangle scarves would be relatively unisex. My budget is somewhat flexible but if possible I'd like to keep it around $50.	episode_done:True

Edit: I’m talking about [these type of boots](https://www.tillys.com/product/wild-diva-over-the-knee-heeled-womens-boots/294704100.html), not riding boots.
text:They're a timeless classic if you ride horses. They're based on English riding boots, which is the predominant style in the eastern US and in competitive or show riding.	labels:A very specific niche I wasn’t referring to in the world of a “women’s fashion” subreddit	episode_done:True
text:What ultimate-splurge fashion item would you buy to reward yourself for achieving a big milestone?	labels:I usually buy solid gold jewelry. Something timeless that will last forever and I'll wear forever. My most recent purchase was a pair of simple 45mm 14k gold hoops.
text:Why 14k vs 22k?	labels:Some reasons could be:   Gold is a soft metal. 22k gold will become damaged easier. Usually more important factor for rings that are worn everyday. In some countries, jewelry is made 14 or 10k gold. Some people prefer the color of 14k to 22k. The color difference is the other metals added to the jewelry.	episode_done:True

No glitter, no metallic thread. I like it on other people, but on me it makes me feel like I’m wearing a costume. Sequins and paillettes only on formal evening wear (for me).  No dolman sleeves (for me). I don’t like how they look on my busty inverted triangle shape.

text:Your favourite men's style shopping "hacks"	labels:Shopping at outlets, especially when focusing on name brands. Easily save 60%+ compared to buying the same brands from their website or a "flagship" store.  Also, especially for athletic shoes, look for the previous year's model.
text:Not menswear but I have RL towels from an outlet 15 years ago that have outlasted every towel I've ever owned. We've bought maybe four or five sets of cheap, shitty towels over the years. They're all worn out but these RL towels that I got to take to the beach from a random outlet store still look like new.  And last year's running shoes is a big tip. A shoe that cost £200 last year will cost £50 once the new model comes out. People were winning marathons in last years model so you'll be fine.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Is anyone dressing up this year for Halloween?	labels:I am ashamed to admit that I forgot it was halloween today. We were invited to a Halloween party a few weeks ago and we declined and I haven’t thought of it much since. The local stores and boutiques near me haven’t done anything special for Halloween this year, just the fall display dragged on. I just got a coffee this morning and am sitting outside to read and just now realized that local coffee shop had no seasonal decor at all whatsoever! So unusual!  I’d best remember to put out a bowl of candy, but many of the places around here canceled trick or treating outright so I don’t have any prepared. You’ve inspired me to take a drive around today and look at some halloween decorations. I miss it! I think I will splurge for the full sized candy bars this afternoon and leave them outside. Give anyone here who IS trick or treating an extra treat!  Thank you ❤️
text:Hahahah I don't blame you. It feels like March 2092nd LOL     You are so right! I haven't seen many stores pushing Halloween stuff like they normally do. I put out some lights, in hopes of bringing some normalcy. Hopefully I will get some kiddos.     Hope you have a blast. I do that exact thing for Christmas.

She says "one is attractive, two becomes trashy".	episode_done:True
text:What are the pros and cons of dressing the way that you do?	labels:Lately, I like to always have one element of casual/streetwear style with a professional outfit, or I like to do the opposite and have a casual outfit with one businessy piece. For example, a skirt suit with a pair of Vans or jeans and a sweatshirt with a structured blazer and loafers.  Con: People have told me they think I am trying too hard to look professional/put together all the time.  Pro: I look somewhat professional and put together all the time. Also I am always comfy and feel a little subversive.

text:What are you hate wearing?	labels:I have been wearing different flannel nightgowns for the past several days, and before that it was leggings with huge sweaters.  I used to almost never wear leggings (or pants at all, really, I'm a tights-and-skirts person) but they're easy.
text:Do you have any recommendations for flannel nightgowns? I’ve come to the realization that I can’t stand the feeling of shorts or my t shirt riding up when I’m sleeping but I also want to be cozy and cover my butt when I’m walking around the house lol.	labels:I have three! Two of them are Lanz of Salzburg ([this one](https://www.vermontcountrystore.com/lanz-mid-length-tyrolean-flannel-nightgown/product/45640) in red and blue – originally one was mine and one was my sister's, but she prefers a big T-shirt over classic nightwear), and [one](https://www.llbean.com/llb/shop/119051?page=1912-flannel-nightgown-pintuck-stand-collar-misses) is LL Bean. They're expensive, but they last forever (I've had my LoS ones since high school and I'm 27) and wash well.  I realize that three may be too many flannel nightgowns, and to that I say 1) fuck you and 2) I want another one that's more aggressively floral.	episode_done:True
text:If you could get yourself one fashion gift, what would it be?	labels:I'd get a really nice piece of outerwear, either a coat in a quality material like wool or a leather or shearling jacket. If you live somewhere with colder weather during part of the year, outerwear is something you'll be wearing all the time so it's worth investing in a piece that's great quality, keeps you warm and makes a statement. I think an amazing jacket or coat will elevate even the most basic outfit, whether it's a more classic piece, something utilitarian like a puffer jacket or something more extravagant. Personally I think Acne, Chloe and Tibi are brands that make great high-end outerwear in a variety of styles.

text:Support Small Businesses This Holiday Season	labels:I disagree, actually. I understand the impulse to put small business on a pedestal- small businesses can lend character and heterogeneity to a locale, which is legitimate. But there's another impulse that I think drives a lot of the small business fetishization that is less helpful, which is the sense that small businesses are innately more ethical than evil large corporations. It makes sense in the American ethos, in which the story of David and Goliath has massive cultural influence, and it even makes sense that we see and hear large corporations being demonstrably evil every day. So in our quest to find the good guy, the natural impulse is to valorize the little guy.   The problem with that analysis is that just because small businesses have a proportionately tiny profile doesnt mean they're not also evil in the shadows. In fact, our love of small businesses in America has caused us to exempt them from a significant portion of essential labor law. On average, [small businesses pay significantly lower wages, offer significantly fewer benefits, and are even exempted from discrimination statutes.](https://jacobinmag.com/2018/01/small-businesses-workers-wages/)  The fetishization of small businesses identifies the wrong Davids and not enough Goliaths. The real Davids are workers, and the Goliaths are bosses. If we're going to assign ethical value to consumption habits, then we should do so by supporting *ethical* companies, not small ones. Companies which rigorously enforce ethical practices, audit their supply chain, and guarantee a living wage. There are large companies and small companies doing this, and the only thing approaching ethical consumption is identifying who is and spending your money there. And more importantly, of course, you should support workers, worker protection policy, and unions.
text:I don't think a perceived ethical advantage plays as big of a part in the equation as you are making it seem.  If you check yelp reviews for enough local dives or huge chains near me you will see someof each with reviews talking about how nice the wait staff is and how great the managers are, and horror stories of unethical behavior.  People in my experience understand that ethical behavior is not based off the size of the establishment, it is based off of the ethics of the establishment.  As an avid small business supporter, for me and many others like me relatability and a personal feeling of making a difference are what guides my consumption, not "ethical fetishization".  Knowing that the 40 cent profit the local place makes off of my $1 doughnut is going to someone who wakes up every morning just like I do and has to go into work and is thankful for a sale is much more satisfying on a personal level than buying it from the dunkin doughnuts that is 5 mins closer who won't feel any impact from my purchase.  &#x200B;  I may get some flack for this, but I am also not a fan of the prerequisite that you have to support unions as an ethical business owner.  I am not sure that unions are any more a fair proxy for ethics than small businesses are.  Some are good and do a good job of ensuring fair treatment and some are not good and cost more in dues than they are worth to the average worker.  I will grant that they are on the whole a net positive, but not for every company in every industry.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Advice needed: How to keep up with trends without social media?	labels:Your best bet is going old school and following blogs. Set up an RSS feed, find people you like, and follow fashion that way.   But this is also a good time for you to explore YOUR personal style, without the influence of... uh... influencers. Obviously some of the fun of fashion is finding out what the trends are as dictated by other people, but with a little freedom from those, you might create silhouettes and combinations that are far more interesting to you personally than whatever's popping off on IG this week.  You can also do what I do and set up an IG that's just for this kind of thing. I don't follow anyone I know, I don't post anything on there. It's just for me to keep up with fashion, some bands I like, and a few owls managed to sneak their way in there. If you set up something like that, you can set aside an hour on the weekend and get caught up on fashion stuff without even installing the app on your phone. A lot of influencers are on YouTube too, so if you'd prefer to stay away from IG altogether, you can just look for their YouTube pages and watch their content on the weekend.

text:What did people *actually* wear in 2000's?	labels:From 2001-2005, clothing I wore as a high schooler/college kid: low rise bootcut jeans, fitted graphic tshirts, fitted polo shirts, fitted shirts in general (shirts were so tight- maybe that’s why we layered??), always layering shirts- and shirts were super long and over your hips, but tight- never tucking them in, cutoff denim skirts, cotton shorts (like soffees) with words on the butt, necklace with my first initial on it, platform flip flops, dresses with Hawaiian prints (like flowers or surfers etc), hoop earrings, fitted hoodies. That’s what I can remember.
text:This is the answer right here! I was 18 in 2000 and this basically sums it up. The only detail I would add is that there was a weird transition period 1999-2002 where low waist pants/crop tops were more of a thing (like Christina Aguilera in the Dirrty era, and that famous pic of Kiera Knightley showing like a mile of torso) just before looooong tops took over once people realized they needed a way to hide their buttcrack.  Also, calf-height pointy toe stiletto boots as far as the eye could see.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 15, 2021	labels:Starting a MFA journey with the new year - I've read through the side-bar posts and am excited about building a wardrobe I enjoy on a daily basis.   Context: I'm a physician and typically in the hospital in Figs Scrubs/UltraBoosts. Outside of the hospital I'm typically in athleisure/gym gear typically Nike 5" inseam running shorts with either short or long-sleeve tops, crew socks, and workout shoes.   I really struggle in the life events between these two most-common scenarios and that's where I'm trying to fill in my wardrobe. I've got some Rhone commuter pants that I really enjoy after having them hemmed and trim-fit Mizzen and Main tops.   I want to start out finding a pair of Jeans that I love and can add to an informal rotation like dates, family events (once pandemic recedes.)

text:What are some differences between stereotypical Millennial and Gen Z fashion/aesthetics?	labels:I think in this conversation it’s sort of difficult to tease apart what was millennial style 10 or so years ago, when millennials were a comparable age, from how millennials dress now, which is more heavily influenced by the fact that we work/have kids/are not in high school now.  As for why sustainable brands are more millennial, it’s because sustainable brands will never be cheap, and ideally the clothing should have some staying power. Younger people don’t have tons of money and also tend to switch it up more often. A sustainable brand would have a harder time marketing to that.
text:Yeah, it doesn't make sense to me to compare modern millennial fashion with modern Gen Z fashion. They're at different points in life, of course their styles will be so different.	labels:Yeah I'm a little confused at the point of this discussion/comparing them.   15 year olds dress differently than 30 year olds?

text:Throwback Thursday: Revisiting "How to Determine Your Body Type" and "On Dressing Your Body Type"	labels:There is a ton of great info in these, though I think what I found most interesting was the section in Body Type about other measurements and proportions, because it offered a clearer explanation of why you might measure as one type and not look it.  Both guides still felt outdated, not only because of the fashion examples, but because the popular silhouette has shifted more in favor of a dramatic hourglass/pear and there more leeway in what’s considered flattering in general.  There already seems to be a lot of (understandable) dislike towards typing systems, so I could see it being beneficial to **start off** with reframing, i.e. “having an understanding of your body shape/silhouette allows you to present it in the way that you feel is most flattering”, and then moving into an explanation of the types (instead of getting right into it/breaking down all the problems before trying to convince you it’s still useful,) the shapes/silhouettes, and how to attain them. Personally, I’d love it if you could go “my body is shaped more like this type, doing xyz would help me look more like that type.” and a mention of each type being more easily read as masculine/feminine/androgynous, though it’d have to be handled delicately;  I just think it’d be helpful for people trying to present themselves more in those ways.	episode_done:True
text:What's the greatest length you've gone to obtain a much coveted fashion item?	labels:Oh this is so silly. When I lived in South Korea, I was always seeing shoes that I wanted, but as an 8/8.5, I couldn’t find any that fit. I could wear size 250-255 but they would be too narrow. So the one day I saw some knee high riding boots with a silver heel. I really wanted them, but of course they didn’t fit and the boutique couldn’t get them in my size.  So I spent the next couple weeks combing the internet for this style in my size. I ended up finding them on a page called “Next Direct,” shipping from the UK. So at the time, we had to pay extra tariffs on imported luxury/tech items totaling more than 150USD  (it was measured in USD not KRW). So that had been a consideration. But I ended up finding these boots for about $140, they were on sale, and free shipping, so I bought them.  A week or so later I started getting kakao messages from someone who said they were in admissions (or whatever you’d call it) and needed info from me, such as my alien registration number. After checking with friends that this was normal, I gave the info and the guy said a delivery person would drop it off. When it was dropped, I had to pay a tariff after all! I think it was $40 or $50. It turned out that the $150 limit was only for items from the US. For items from the UK, the limit was $100. So I ended up paying almost $200 for these boots (and mind you, I was an assistant professor at a local uni, not making big bucks and being paid in KRW) AND despite being from the UK, they were barely even water resistant. Definitely not water proof.

text:What does business casual mean to you?	labels:It means suit clothes without the blazer (or tie for men). More formal than smart casual, but not full on suit.

I think it holds true for an environment where traditional offices jobs are common, especially if you are in a profession that handles money.  Of course, you’ll always get the “I work in California tech and go to the office in my yoga pants” people, so as with everything it depends on where you are and what context

Sharing this essay I wrote about watches and menswear, which is really a companion piece to the latest episode [of my podcast](https://soundcloud.com/styleanddirection/sad55).  It's really just about my personal thoughts on watches! I never really grew up wanting a watch nor did my family have a history with them. It's something I never thought was essential or integral to my style, which sometimes came at odds with my menswear/watch friends. I don't like status symbols or feeling like I *have* to wear a watch (I don't need the Timex Weekender ok), but I did eventually pick a few up that were more silly.  The blog and pod goes into a lot, from why Spencer and I don't really buy watches and the aesthetics/details we do enjoy to how we wear the ones we do own. If you know me and the blog well, you'll know that outfit aesthetics and playing/subversion is a big part in anything that I choose.   Anyway, I hope you enjoy reading this article and the podcast!

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 15, 2020	labels:Moore's or Indochino?  I've got a wedding coming up in the new year, I'm using it as an excuse to get a suit tailored from scratch. I've been wearing ill-fitting Value Village suits for the past decade and want something I can use for job interviews and black tie events. Both Moore's and Indochino offered to make me a suit for $550 CAD. I have no independent Tailor shops that actually sell clothing in my city, they just adjust clothing you bring, that's why I'm not going to them.  I was just rewatching the first season of Better Call Saul which, at least the first few episodes made me realize how a cheap suit, fitted or not, can really look bad.

text:How to avoid looking older with your clothing??	labels:I think it can sometimes be possible to accidentally make yourself look 14-going-on-55, but it’s not by wearing a currently trendy look like you’re talking about. It’s by not caring about clothes and letting your mom who also doesn’t care about clothes buy them for you. This happened to my sister and cousins back a couple decades ago, and it’s a bit weird to look back at pictures in their teens and see that they look older then than they do now in their mid thirties. The key is they had what were at the time the same haircuts and clothes their moms were wearing, and it made them look like they were dressing up as not particularly fashionable middle aged women. So...unless your mom has great personal style, don’t dress like your mom dresses right now and you should be fine.  On the other hand, I also have a cousin that took on some variant of what we’re now calling dark academia about 10-15 years ago, specifically thrifted professorial suits from the 80s. He didn’t look old. He looked like a 14 year old who decided to dress up as a 80s stockbroker for Halloween. It wasn’t aging, and if anything it make him look more of a kid because of the contrast.  So wear your tweed! You’ll look like a 14 year old wearing tweed!
text:When I was about 14-15 I had my hair cut by my aunt's friend (it didn't help that my hair started to get curly and I had no idea what to do except blow dry the crap out of it) and had to wear unflattering glasses that my parents picked for me. Idk if that made me look older as in ppl guessing my age wrong, but it certainly looked frumpy.   It's possible to confuse ppl with something like heavy makeup though. When you look at old yearbooks from the 1950s a lot of the teenagers back then looked much older at first glance and it's because of the very formal looking hair and makeup (probably done specifically and exclusively for the picture), not the clothes.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 13, 2020	labels:Is there any hair gel that has the affect of what water does to your hair but for longer. Like usually if I wanna make my hair puff up for a bit or just not look flat in general, I put a little water in my hands, between my fingers and push up, combing the water through my hair. Usual hair gel I’ve had experience with before is very thick and makes my hair look drastically different and it’s hard for me to style it cause it loses its integrity as the gel is too thick. Like I said, water like consistently that last longer than actual water and that doesn’t change the look of my hair too much, just going around certain areas to make it look less rice bowl, less flat. (Edit: Sorry if I sound stupid, I don’t know crap about anything regarding hair and how to style it. I’ve just been trying to change it up a bit and look better.)
text:I use a paste/wax/clay. It doesn't make your hair look wet, and all you need to do to re-shape without applying more product is get your hands a little wet first. It washes out easily as well.  American Crew, Dove for Men, Redken, and a bunch of other brands carry it.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:What true heirloom pieces do you own and how do you incorporate them into your style?	labels:A little different but I own several saris and a couple of lehengas, some of which were my mum's and some from my grandma on my dad's side.  With my mum's, I like to style them as she wore them which is pretty traditional and really lean into the 80s style with fluffy hair and major winged eyeliner but I normally add a statement piece of jewellery to make it mine.  My grandma's I tend to mix up with different styles of blouses, different scarves and wear as more of a mishmash to fit in with the trends at the moment. One of the saris she gave, I've had made into a lehenga with two different blouses and the skirt into a ruffled, almost flamenco kind of skirt because the material really suits that kind of thing.
text:That's so cool!!! I don't know much about how saris and lehengas changed in style over time, but I LOVE the idea that you had one of the skirts made ruffly!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Is fast fashion really fast fashion if you get years of use out of the garments?	labels:I'm in similar age and position to you, last summer I decided to focus more on buying secondhand, sustainable and ethical clothes. This is a really complex and nuanced subject and part of the problem is that there is no set definition of 'ethical' or 'sustainable' and they are often used interchangeably.  There are lots of ideas involved:  **The people** how much impact does production have on the workers? Are they being paid a living wage? Can they  unionise and fight for their rights?  **The environment** how much impact does production have on the environment? What happens to it after it is used? Is production circular (i.e. can clothes be recycled and used in new clothing rather than 'downcycled' into lesser quality rags)  **Animals** are you happy to wear wool or leather? If so, are the sheep being treated well (mulesing free wool) and is how the leather is processed/dyed harmful to the workers and the environment?  And that's before it even reaches the consumer and whether you can even afford or access ethical and sustainable fashion.   Someone below has defined fast fashion really well. It is, as they mentioned, based on the speed of production. A matter of weeks rather than what used to be the length of a few months. Fast fashion is not necessarily cheap but is, by definition, produced at a fast rate. The problem can be that it doesn't last very long but equally, I think we've all had fast fashion items that last for years.   There are two main issues with fast fashion: the culture of buying and throwing away piles and piles of cheap clothing that ends up in landfill or in developing countries that in turn negatively affects local economies and the exploitation of labour. To produce at this rate (sometimes thousands of new products in 2 weeks) it means that people, mostly ethnic women, are going to be exploited. For me, the most important thing is fair labour and, when I can afford it, I would rather buy the same item for £30 than £5 because I know it's directly benefitting someone.  I love this quote from a Dutch designer, Li Edelkoort:  > “How can a product that needs to be sown, grown, harvested, combed, spun, knitted, cut and stitched, finished, printed, labelled, packaged and transported cost a couple of Euros?”  So basically, I guess my answer is any fast fashion is worse than slow fashion because it doesn't take any of these multiple issues into account. Now, if you can't afford anything but fast fashion I would argue that higher quality clothing is the way to go because it does last longer and it does mean you won't be participating in the very problematic fashion industry as quickly again.   Side note: We all have fast fashion items that have lasted years. I'd bet that those are made of better fabrics, have better stitching, maybe come from a batch of 1000 rather than a batch of 5000 so more time was taken to make each item. Maybe you only wear that dress on special occasions, maybe you take better care of your clothes in general. Maybe the item has no stretch or give to save costs but you're a smaller size so it doesn't matter.   Having said all of that, it should not be us, the consumers, fixing the problem of an entire industry fashion, it should be governments and companies. However, I believe in grassroots change and that we should take *some* responsibility whether that be changing our shopping habits, campaigning or just educating ourselves, collectively we can make change. (Veganism, as an example has increased by something like 200% in 20 years and that's definitely been grassroots.)   I follow a few YouTubers who have really helped me understand slow fashion as a whole and would really recommend them. Top one is Inspiroue/Cynthia, I also really like Aime Maggie, Ash Tanya does a bit more of the social commentary side of things. My Green Closet is great too as is Sustainability Vegan.   P.S. Thank you for bringing this topic to FFA. So many interesting comments here. The ethical fashion sub does not have nearly the amount of discussion posts as I'd prefer!	episode_done:True

I've never dropped this kind of money for a coat before and I was afraid I would regret it but she's gorgeous and the quality is top notch. A runner up would be the Levi Ribcage jeans - so cute, so well fitting, Also the Madewell MWL brand sweatpants are a 10/10 for work from home - sooooo soft (and I've tried a LOT of sweats, lol.)  Worst - I regret nearly all of my ASOS purchases and just donated a ton of stuff that still had tags. I regret nearly everything I bought on impulse from sales anywhere except for the high quality stuff.  I guess my lesson from 2020 is I want fewer high quality items vs. more lower quality items. This is news to me because higher quality stuff only recently became financially accessible.

text:General Discussion - October 20	labels:Just how strong is the Tesla koolaid?  "Tesla admits design flaw led to vehicle rear bumper falling off when driving in puddles of water"  You make luxury vehicles. Get the basics right and stop living in a Clarke and Dawe sketch, you drugged up weirdo.  But some of the comments in the [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/ht8m0b/tesla_model_3_rear_bumper_falling_off_issue_more/) on r/electricvehicles:  > If it's 1 in 100,000 chance, and there is no safety consequences - then service center is ok.  I'd say the bumper falling off when it gets wet is a *slight* safety issue.  > Anecdotal, but I've driven my 2018 Model 3 through two very large pools of water last year. No issues in general from that surprisingly.   TWO whole puddles? Well someone please give Mr. Musk his gold star.  > I can’t imagine many owners would go to the shop to get this changed out. I know I wouldn’t...waste of time.  A bigger waste of time than having to replace the ass end of the car after a little mist?  > My early 2020 model 3 bumper has visible gaps in the rear bumper that were not there on delivery. Like it's slowly getting pulled off. Tesla service tech told me it's normal defiation  Just...wow  > I would still take a Tesla with its QC issues over they comparable ICE vehicle.  To each their own, but personally I value my car arriving at its destination in one piece over method of propulsion.  This is early Kia level quality from a brand that wants to be considered exclusive and innovative; at least Hyundai and Kia made amends with a great warranty. And people are seemingly unbothered with having their $50,000+ car fall apart on them in completely normal driving conditions.
text:I'd like to see how this take fares on /r/wallstreetbets	labels:I won't pretend to understand the stock market, but when I look at the Tesla share price increase I wonder what I'm missing. They consistently rank among the worst brands for consumer complaints and won't take responsibility for the issues.

text:Tips for easily looking more modern/in style?	labels:I would recommend updating your "fashion basics" like plain t-shirts and jeans first because then more unique pieces will just look unique, not outdated.

text:Do you feel constrained fashion-wise by not wanting to (or being able to) wear heels?	labels:I recently lived in Paris near some of the the biggest tourist attractions, and I would spot Instagram influencers daily. I’d say I’d see them change into heels about half the time. Some folks just commit, but it always stood out as unusual. Paris is not stiletto friendly. Although it’s seen as a formal city, compared to any American metropolis, footwear is casual and out wear is practical. That being said, a 2-3 inch heeled boot or bootie was not uncommon and along with sneakers, the norm.   My most memorable influencer sighting was a very glamorous woman in a tiny yellow dress and heels on a 40 degree (Fahrenheit) day taking pictures on a windy terrace, only to see her minutes later coming out of a public restroom in weather appropriate and casual attire.   I feel like this stuff is dependent on your own lifestyle, and the context of the city. My own comfort level with heels has changed significantly over the past decade, from wearing a heel everywhere, everyday to now owning one pair for parties.  As for non-heeled influencers: there are so many! What kind of style do you gravitative towards?
text:I live in another european city. One of the true marks of a tourist is clueless-ness regarding footwear. Heels are a very stupid thing in our historical center (I have literally seen tourists wearing heels needing to hold the hand of friends or boyfriends to come down some streets tottering down) and arguably elsewhere. Something else on the other side which is a really bad idea is havaiana flipflops or in general shoes too soft and with too thin  a sole. I see influencer photos or planned capsule wardrobe advices to some cities I know and I just shake my head instinctively.  Also regarding Paris, something which baffles me, you know the gravel on so many Paris gardens and parks? Then you got these romantic influencer photos of people in the Tuileries  or Luxembourg in tiny open sandals or shoes where the gravel could get inside.. Those women must have a much higher tolerance for gravel or dirt between the shoe and the sole of your foot than I do....	labels:Another European here, we have a ton of cobblestone and gravel here and I've literally seen tourists trip and break their foot.  Also a lot of historical buildings and museums will give you these soft cushioned overshoes so you don't scratch up their floors. You can't wear them over heels, that would be another death trap...   I have a friend who wears heels a lot regardless, and she always has a pair of flats in her bag and is constantly changing them back and forth. For me that would be too much of a hassle and it's annoying af when everyone has to wait for that one girl to change her shoes again 😒 I mean, why even bother?	episode_done:True

Yohji Yamamoto is another Japanese designer who does similar Japanese inspired cuts.

Think wide trousers, wider tops, etc. If you look at Uniqlo, they have some of this, particularly in the Marimekko colabs.   As I noted before, COS tends to do this with wide fit dresses in summer, and kimono sleeve items in winter. I have several cardigans from them which are open kimono inspired, as well as a large collection of A line dresses.  https://old.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/awpif8/lagenlook_what_is_it_where_to_find_it_and/	episode_done:True

My kids have always been allowed to pick their own clothes and style them how they want. Sometimes I give them advice on their fashion choices which they are free to ignore. They love my style and frequently steal stuff from my closet.  We don't have a lot of body type discussions in regards to clothes, because I don't want that to be their focus. I want them to focus on creativity and enjoyment of their clothes. Plus for my trans kid, their hourglass figure is a stressor for them. If they are struggling to style something, I help them out.	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 10, 2020	labels:What are your first thoughts when you see someone wearing a nice, name brand watch?  By name brand, I mean brands that are universally recognized (Rolex, Omega, etc.).  By nice, I mean the watch appears to cost a lot of money.
text:I don't.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:People who used to play super safe with fashion, how did you overcome your fear of bold choices?	labels:I used to be absolutely terrified of skirts, anything tight and anything bright - I still struggle with certain colours and certain silhouettes but I did find a couple of things to help.    1. I looked at my friends, and I mean looked at them - look past their weight, their hair, their features and see them as any other person (this worked best for me with a thinner friend, I used to think a lot of my fashion restrictions were because things just wouldn't look right on a bigger woman). I used to recognise why I wouldn't wear something - let's say a turtleneck for example, I would have believed it would show up my double chin more - and then I would look at my friend or just ask myself: 'would this be different if my body was the same as my friends'. What I noticed was my friend also had a little chin, but I had never noticed it before. I never noticed it with or without. That's not to say no one will notice, but it is to say that what you wear doesn't really change the way you are perceived to an extent; my chin looks the same size in a t shirt and a turtleneck because it is the same size.   2. I don't know if this would work for everyone but I wouldn't use a mirror. At all. Not forever, mostly when I was trying something new so that I could leave the house without judging myself first, because then I would convince myself I would also be judged by others. I used to think french tucking also looked odd on me or someone would think I was just lazy until I didn't use a mirror, no one treated me different or said anything bad about it and so I took that as my affirmation that I didn't look stupid. I sometimes just got my outfit on the night before because I realised I was in a better mind set to judge my clothes (no mirror in the morning), I naturally was just more forgiving of myself, so maybe try to recognise when you feel your best on a day to day basis and use that time to try these things on, and maybe agree with yourself that you will wear it the next day.   Having said that, sometimes you just aren't comfortable in something and if you wear it for a day or two and you can't get over it then replace it with something else new! I still can't wear any colours other than yellow, red or green and some silhouettes still intimidate me but I now love skirts and I love turtlenecks and loads of things I saw as out of my reach.   Good luck! X	episode_done:True

I’ve been scouring stores nonstop for low rise but all I can find is high rise :( I’m having trouble thrifting any too because all I can find is skinny jeans and tbh after a decade of popularity skinny jeans are definitely out  I was a 90s baby/2000s kid so I never really experienced the true low rise era.

text:BoF: J. Crew's New CEO has a Survival Plan: Edit out the Ugly	labels:Middle-aged person here and copping to my age only because it legit adds context:  I was in high school when I started getting the J. Crew catalog, in the late 1980s. [Linda Evangelista was one of the models](https://silklacewool.tumblr.com/post/163833033703/barbiescanner-j-crew-1989-linda-evangelista), right as she was beginning her career, which should give you an idea of the time period; she had her little mushroom haircut and I remember her in a long-sleeved t-shirt and, like, flannel pajama shorts.  For a lot of Gen Xers like me, the appeal to J. Crew in those days rested in two things: the quality *and the styling in the catalog* \-- they'd do layouts which were capsule wardrobe before capsule was a thing, they'd show [women wearing the men's clothing in cute ways](https://nibsblog.wordpress.com/2010/01/19/menswear-for-women-1994/), and they'd emphasize [the standards you could expect to see season after season](https://assets.vogue.com/photos/59f371a211143b4f8402f7da/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/06-jcrew-reissues.jpg). So if you couldn't afford the barn jacket out of your allowance in 1989, you could rest assured it would still be there in 1990.  (I still have two barn jackets from 1991, plus a lovely guava-pink cotton v-neck tee I bought in summer 1993 and a roll-neck sweater from 1995; the only reason I don't have two fantastic ribbed merino v-necks from 1998 is because the moths got to them in 2011 while I was distracted on maternity leave.)  That catalog was a really effective piece of marketing because you could come back to it again and again, and absorb [a particular type of preppy-but-cooler presentation](https://theculturetrip.com/north-america/usa/articles/90s-nostalgia-prep-school-chic-and-the-j-crew-catalogue/) from it.  For the girls in my college dorms, Catalog Day was a big deal. We'd get together and read through and comment on the styles and assess how it would all work with the stuff we already had.  The catalog is gone, the website now offers far fewer styling inspirations and there's way too much stuff. And that's not even getting into the quality issues or the pricing.  The brand is unappealing to the people who used to be its core constituency; there's no value there because I'm not seeing fresh ways to wear well-made basics. I mean, freakin' [Primary.com](https://Primary.com),  a children's site,  does a better job on its site of showing how to mix and match its basics for fun and personal style.  J. Crew needs to edit the hell out of its inventory and maybe reconsider what value they can bring to consumers that other elevated-basics lines like Cuyana and Everlane aren't offering.  Perhaps younger consumers are attuned to a digital-first model for remixing/restyling retailer offerings and Instagram and TikTok work for them, but maybe J. Crew needs to consider [a catalog to revive that emotional connection with their older customers](https://www.townandcountrymag.com/style/fashion-trends/a32434902/j-crew-bankrupty-catalog-nostalgia/) or create a new type of communal, social catalog event with younger ones.
text:I agree. The clothes are expensive (for a ready to wear mass brand). Are they quality? I don’t know, but what I do know is that if I can’t imagine how to wear it over the course of 5 years coming up, I am not going to spend $$$ on it. I used to get their catalogues “back in the day” and one could—as you rightly point out—find what one expected, such as a wool coat, or a work trouser, but also some suggestions on how to wear it in a “new” way this year. So you could keep buying one or two items from J Crew each year and know you could mix it with your older J Crew easily (and it was good quality so it lasted).   One year I picked up a catalogue, thought “hmm, this looks like one of those crappy websites filled with random crap” and never looked back. Similar store experience. Doesn’t feel curated and way overpriced.	labels:	episode_done:True

That said, culling some isn’t a bad idea, there are a lot I don’t really wear or keep for sentimental reasons only.  I’d say that lately I like baggier tees for lounging at home in while I work or throwing on for a walk in the summer. Bonus if I can go braless in them.  I have two camps of tees now - those that are plain and fitted and can maybe sneak by under a jacket or cardigan at work and those that I could never wear to the office and are purely for comfort.. these are baggy and often have logos or designs on them.  My baggy tee camp is getting larger! I love going to a thrift store and checking out the men’s small and medium tees. They’re good quality and cheap. I try and bring a few shirts in to donate before I get more because they start multiplying quickly.
text:I used to have wayyyyy more several years ago! So honestly 34 doesn’t seem like that much, even though it covers more than a month of clothes... I justify it because they have different functions and some get worn a lot more than others.   Same on the baggy tee camp! I pared way down on graphic tees a few years ago, but I’ve acquired a bunch since the pandemic so I had something fun to wear! I used to do the fitted tee under a blazer look a lot when I had to dress up for work (very rarely) but now I have button ups that I actually like, I just wear those.

They're selling those pieces "in collaboration" with the communities for $200~ like the Sarape or Poncho, but 1) those items are clearly made and mostly designed entirely by the people from those communities and 2) that kind of artisan clothes usually cost around $10-$40 when you buy them directly from the producers or on Mexican websites. I don't worry much about the price of the clothes on the website, but I do worry that they could be making a humongous 90% profit by just reselling
text:You could always contact them! Their instagram is always active and you should be able to get a response. Also from what I know, the fabrics are certified organic and are from small specific mills. Also Alejandro makes all the clothes by hand. If I'm not mistaken, Alejandro is also mexican and is doing work based on his heritage. Small businesses like these don't make 90% profit because it takes time, money and effort to create a small amount of clothing.   As for myself, I'm not 100% sure on mexican traditional clothing and how much they cost but I know that their western style clothing is worth the price.

text:Discussion: LGBTQIA+ Signaling, Presentation, and Commodification in Fashion	labels:I am so glad this post exists! I’ve been mulling over what queer fashion means to me so much recently. I am a 23F lesbian. I didn’t really have much of a conscious idea that I was queer until I was a senior in high school, and I was uncomfortably/quietly identifying as bi through most of college—it’s pretty recently that I realized I was gay. I went to a historically women’s college in the south (so, very gay), and I’m a lifelong urban southerner as well. College changed my life, in terms of queerness—There are so many ways that I began to see queerness as a possibility for the first time because of where I went to school, but presentation and visibility was so much of that formula. I remember meeting one of my best friends in a class when I was a first year and thinking for the first time “oh, this person is consciously choosing to show other people that she’s queer by how she’s dressed right now.” She has a pretty dapper, academic butch style, and I had literally never met anyone who dressed like her (or many others on campus, like my butch women’s studies professor). Through high school and the first bit of college, I think my fashion sense was influenced by a few different somewhat alternative sources (pop punk, tumblr, that twee/ModCloth style that was huge in 2014), but I felt like I dressed in a more muted, watered down version of the aesthetic I really wanted to be, even though I didn’t know what that aesthetic was yet.   In the middle of college, I broke up with my boyfriend and got cancer, so that was pretty crazy! Having cancer changed my presentation as a queer person pretty radically, considering I went from having long, plain hair to a buzz cut. On my campus, most people didn’t know I was sick because it was just that common to get a buzz cut randomly, and I both liked and disliked how drastically my visibility as a queer person changed. Now, I prefer having hair that’s a little more femme (I’m all good now and my hair is finally in a style I actively enjoy lmao), but for the first time I think I was read as queer when people just saw me.   Before realizing I was gay, I had mostly dated people who are read as masculine/male by the dominant culture. Though some of these were queer relationships, I think that part of me felt like I couldn’t dress as queer as I wanted to because, when I was dating a man, I felt like he would feel emasculated subconsciously, and when I was dating a non-binary person, both of us had a hard time dressing as queer as we wanted to because we were not as out as we wanted.   Now, I feel like I am finally getting to freely dress, or try dressing, as queer as I’d like to. To me, a queer vibe has a similar feeling as dressing alternative, or in some way off from dominant culture. I do not identify strongly as butch or femme (though my friends tell me I’m kind of butchy femme?), but my style is something like artsy/thrifted/vintage/elecectic. I definitely think some parts of dressing queer for me are intentionally mismatched, ugly, or tacky, and I love playing with that. I am definitely influenced by what I see people my age wearing on Tiktok, and before graduating, I was SO influenced by what I saw queer people I looked up to wearing on my campus. For the most part, I don’t feel oppressed or restricted by what other queer people say looks queer, I usually feel very uplifted by presenting queer in a way that makes me feel allied with other queer people. As an example, recently bandannas have become some thing that feels like a kind of gay look, and it’s fun and cute to feel like I get to participate in that trend.  One thing I am kind of bothered by is that I feel like I see, especially because I’ve been on Tiktok so much since Covid, I feel like things that I thought were gay tells are starting to be worn a lot more by alternative straight people. I don’t really consider combat boots, flannels, mom jeans, nose piercings, or dyed hair to be certain indicators of queerness anymore, at least not by themselves, depending on how they’re styled. I feel like the phrase cultural appropriation is not appropriate here, because that applies to race and culture in a way that I don’t think it applies to queerness. And I also don’t think that queer people own certain “tells”, and I don’t really blame straight people for dressing kind of queer as long as they don’t mind if people read them as queer sometimes. Maybe commodification? I’m more talking about the way stores repackage queer aesthetics. Like, walk into a forever 21 and a lot of the things that are popular now I would say read pretty gay, or would have read pretty gay to me a few years ago, but they’re being sold as part of this alternative, “cool” aesthetic. The store however, I would argue, opposes much of what queerness stands for (because I think of queerness as a political commitment to resisting norms in addition to non normative gender or sexuality).   So many thoughts! I think what I’m trying to say is that I try to dress pretty gay now, and sometimes I feel like I have to dress ever gayer because the things that I see as gay right now are going to be picked up by straight culture next year because they’re seen as cool and edgy, and then they won’t be gay tells anymore lol.
text:I definitely agree about the commodification of queer aesthetics, especially for queer women because I feel like straight women are more likely to adopt queer fashion than straight men. My personal style apparently screams lesbian to every queer person that I meet, but straight people see my long hair, makeup, and style and think I'm straight and I just like the "art hoe" style lmao. As in, I do look like an art student. It can be kind of frustrating at times. I'd like to work out what exactly makes me clearly a lesbian and highlight it lmao, although I can't deny that the lesbian chameleon thing works to my advantage sometimes. It also means straight people who won't like the lesbianism don't spot me.	labels:This is what I was getting at—the art hoe aesthetic is a great example. “Funky art teacher” is a related vibe I often aspire to lmao. I think it is kind of cool that queer people see queerness where straight people don’t, in that I love that queer people pick up on and connect with other possible queer people. It makes me feel more connected to my community to feel like I’m seen even if I don’t have to wear like a rainbow flag over my head.	episode_done:True

I wore them once for a formal outfit a few years ago, and really loved the way it looked so I’ve started incorporating them in a lot of my outfits for work and going out since.

They're pricey but  they last-- going on 3 years with mine and they still look new-- you can dress them up or down with ease.  I also love my black rubber Birkenstocks since I live by the beach. Between those, my Sabahs, and a classic pair of Stan Smiths, I can cover almost all outfits.

text:what pieces/brands did you buy when moving from a warmer climate to a cooler climate? what did you end up regretting/not using?	labels:1. Materials are the most important. Forget about anything synthetic or plant based. Bamboo, polyester, acrylic or nylon will NOT keep you warm. Wool, alpaca, cashmere, leather, fur, angora, down, etc. are materials for true winter. Thick cotton can be ok. Polyester/acrylic/fake fur are plastic which makes you sweat and then you get really cold (!)   2. Buy second handed. Real winter clothes are expensive.   3. Check if the climate swings a lot around 0°C / 32F. If it does, you'll probably get a lot of dirty wet snow. This is WET and make sure you get a jacket with has at least 5.000 mm. Rain capacity. Good pair of rubber boots.   5. Be sure to buy your clothes a bit bigger than usual so you can put an extra layer under.   4. Socks. Woolen, thick, cozy socks. Preferably a few pair. Don't get fooled by 50% polyamide/50% wool. You want the real deal, 100% wool.   5. Most heat from the body goes through our heads. Get a good warm hat that covers full head.   6. Regarding brands, they'll fool you. Always go for the right material instead.  Good luck.	episode_done:True

text:How do you style your existing wardrobe in a way that doesn’t get boring?	labels:I also have a large collection of clothes that stumps me, and here's what I'm doing that's helping:  1. I made a list of every TV character I could think of whose style I like   2. Research: I made folders of inspo photos for each one/re watched some episodes/read "how to dress like" articles   3. Started putting together outfits I thought they would wear, instead of thinking "what do I want to wear today?"  A sample of characters I referenced: Darlene from Roseanne, Shane from the L Word, Aria Montgomery from Pretty Little Liars, Jenny Humphrey from Gossip Girl (Season 2)  ETA Thank you for the awards kind strangers! This project just keeps getting more fun! Also fixed some formatting.  2nd ETA For the research part, I found that it was important to actually go back and rewatch the character in action, not just rely on other people's lists/Pinterest. I would have done Pretty Little Liars soooo differently if I hadn't rewatched some of my favorite episodes, because the lists tend to feature their most ambitious/ridiculous looks.
text:You're so right that copying the work of stylists for TV is a great exercise. I'm having a lot of trouble though because I don't have a wide range of colors! My tones are so neutral/black/jewel tone. No brights, almost anywhere! And when you do have the right colors, hopefully they're the right cut to work with one another, e.g. high waisted with cropped tops or oversized with tight. One thing I'd like to do as a takeaway from all of this is to stop buying dresses. Separates are so much more fun to try to nail! And, to focus on TEXTURE. Beware of your Forever 21's and other cheap lines for this, quality fabric is key to an interesting texture!	labels:I think there's value in exploring why you don't have the necessary pieces to copy a look. I don't wear pastels, for the most part, and had to cross a few people off the list because that was going to make it impossible for me to pull off the reference. However, my coloring is more suited to jewel tones, anyway. Realizing that means I can focus future purchases on pieces that will coordinate better with my current wardrobe AND flatter my complexion.	episode_done:True

text:Rant - I'm fed up with fashion and "expressing myself"	labels:Have you thought about uniform dressing? I'm not talking about a boring black t-shirt and jeans every day. I wear a dress, sweater, and black pair of shoes every day. In the winder I add tights/leggings and an ankle book (summer is black sandals). I never have to think too much about what I wear and I don't really have to make any decisions after I purchase the item. My dresses are really comfortable, all of them have pockets, and I get compliments constantly. Uniform dressing sounds really boring, but you can create a fun and unique type of uniform if you want.  I tried a capsule wardrobe earlier this summer. It had dresses, shirts, pants and shorts, but I went back just dresses because the capsule was too many decisions. I just pick a dress that is clean and move on with my day, but I also still have a distinct and unique style.
text:This 100%. I've had periods in my life where I've been over thinking about what I'm wearing, but also still need to look nice. Uniform dressing has been my go to for those periods in my life. I also love thrifting (for most things I own, not just clothes) so it has been very cheap to put together a uniform (and honestly, I find thrift shopping easier for a lot of clothes than shopping new because there are so many different brands of clothes all together, it's much easier to try things from different brands/stores). Some uniforms I've done in the past:  * University: jeans, tshirt, zipup hoodie. Boots/coat in the winter, shorts/sandals in the winter.   * Professional job just after moving: skirt, comfy flat shoes, professional shirt, cardigan.   * New mom: leggings, short boots, tunic/long cardigan, tank.   When I'm feeling more comfortable/have the time/money/available brain space to focus on fashion again, i do. I know my uniform isn't forever, it's just for a period of time. And that makes it feel comforting rather than stifling.	labels:I think having different uniforms for different parts of life a single time period makes sense too. If you're only ever going to wear leggings when you're hanging out with small children, then change out of your work uniform into your home uniform every day.	episode_done:True

Did you add anything new to your winter wardrobe that stands out?	labels:I have circulation issues and am always incredibly cold. I finally purchased a down coat, and lemme tell you- it's an absolute game changer!! I bought a Fjallraven parka a few summers ago (HIGHLY suggest checking out their summer sale) and it has withstood quite a few cold, east coast winters. It keeps me so warm, I barely have to layer underneath it!  I'd recommend any down coats but they're definitely pricey. I lucked out and got mine on sale, so I'd suggest checking out off season sales at outdoor/ski shops, and even brand sample sales! A lot of older coats have down in them too (today's coats are all lined with polyester) so I'd recommend thrifting too!
text:Aritzia is good warmth to price brand if you grab one on sale at the end of season. Even at full price they’re one quarter to one third what you’ll pay for a pricier brand and they’re very warm. With a pair of snow pants and a few Heattech layers underneath I’ve been outside for over an hour in -20 C while feeling like still in bed under the duvet. My only issue is quality.

I also started caring about what I wear and planning my outfits. Velvet shoes, corduroy overalls, rainbow prints, sequins, bold colors. Who cares? I've been called out for dressing "fancy" before, but I've stopped giving a shit in correlation with my confidence in my abilities.

text:Does anyone else use a “formula” to create their outfits?	labels:For me it's about deciding what you want your look to be and choosing items based on that instead of trends. If I tried to be trendy, I'd feel like I was throwing my hard-earned money in the garbage while gunking up my closet with stuff I'll never wear.  I keep it simple. Basically I let comfort guide the way- the temperature outside tells me what kind of fabric I want to wear. Cotton/linen for heat, wool/silk for the cold. The weather determines what kind of shoes I'm wearing. If my top is sexy, my bottoms are conservative, and visa versa.  A few rules of thumb: if you find good work pants that fit, buy as many as you can afford. This is the single hardest clothing item to find. Ask yourself whether that cute item in the store goes with anything in your closet, and if it doesn't, let it go. If you don't like ironing your clothes, don't buy clothes that need to be ironed/steamed, and get yourself some wrinkle releaser. Don't spend good money on cheaply constructed clothing. How do the seams look? How are the buttons fastened? How do you wash it? Do you need to buy a new bra in order to wear this top w/out your straps showing? Etc.	episode_done:True

text:Mario Valentino is not Valentino Garavani	labels:Ahhh I remember seeing the Mario Valentino bags at a Nordstrom rack. I was so confused why they were just rolling around the store with a simple anti theft beeper tag on it instead of being in the locked display cases. That store had Mansur Gavriel bucket bags among over actual designer labels in the display cases yet the originally $1000 “Valentino” on sale for $250 was mixed in a bin in a bin of Michael kors.

text:Effortless style - let's exchange tips and tricks	labels:I think [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/id2khu/how_do_you_make_yourself_look_put_together_every/) thread from four days ago touches on the effortless look quite a bit. [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/981zhq/how_to_look_polished_and_put_together/) thread from two years ago also has some good advice.  My honest thoughts and opinions are that I don't understand the obsession with looking effortless. I can't tell if it's because so many women struggle with internalized misogyny and want so desperately to have the appearance that they're ~not like other girls~ who spend time and money on their appearance. They're not like ~those girls~ who buy Pat McGrath and Charlotte Tilbury over Glossier and Milk. They're not like ~those girls~ who waste time on IG following women who obviously spend ~too much~ money on clothing, shoes and accessories.   Most people could look "effortless" if they just wore clothes that fit properly, used a steamer, and knew what hair styles and makeup works for them.  EDIT: I think [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/9l9rjq/can_we_talk_about_the_little_things_you_do_every/) thread from one year ago also has some solid advice. It's all a bit repetitive, but that's because a big part of looking polished is being well groomed, not walking around in wrinkled or poorly fitted clothes. And clothes don't have to be expensive to fit well either. There's no rule that says you have to wear a $200 blouse for it to fit well or that only AG jeans are flattering on someones body type. I follow influencers like [cocobeautea](https://www.instagram.com/cocobeautea/), [ewelina kanty](https://www.instagram.com/ewelinakanty/) and [steffystyle](https://www.instagram.com/steffysstyle/) who rock Mango, Zara, HM and Uniqlo-they will also mix luxury or high end with more affordable and accessible brands like Mango and Zara.  **EDIT**: since we are going to address the elephant in the room, "effortless" being code for white & thin, I'd like to suggest a few alternatives for the other black folks out there. I'll copy and paste my response to another comment-  In my opinion, [Tiffany Battle](https://instagram.com/tiffanymbattle?igshid=18ad3p0hrgr4b) is effortless with her style. When I look at her I assume it all naturally comes together and she knows what she wants pieced with each other. [Style pantry](https://instagram.com/stylepantry?igshid=2mwbifvvtx6g) is another example of someone who looks effortless to me. [Highlowluxxe](https://instagram.com/highlowluxxe?igshid=lvtkd76s72vf) and [musingsofacurvylady](https://instagram.com/musingsofacurvylady?igshid=nr99stp0732z) are all effortless because they know what works for them. But I know this is not the definition of effortless in this sub
text:Agree.  And it's actually interesting delving into the Black French influencer pool recently and seeing how generally divergent it is to the white French influencer pool, even though French style is supposedly one size fits all.

text:Are our ideas about what looks “dated” on either ourselves or others affected by or correlated with our age?	labels:Yes, I do think our age definitely affects what looks dated to our eye.   I’m noticing that some younger men are wearing some strange iterations of 80’s color-blocked track suits that to me look very Golden Girls. Also, I’ve seen shirt and shorts sets on rappers made out of wild print fabrics exactly like the ones I made for my toddler 25 years ago.  I’m older, so I’ve seen a lot of trends come and go. We are now at the point where they are starting to repeat and are designated as “Vintage”.  I have cultivated my personal style over many years (boho/western), and have seen it done well by Ralph Lauren and most recently Christian Dior in 2018(?) and enjoy the idea of wearing the beautiful things I’ve collected until the end of my life.

text:Fashion "fantasies" coming true years later?	labels:Male here (kind of important for this story).  Growing up I was always really jealous of female fashion, makeup and the ability to express yourself in your clothing (and it not coming down purely to details or fabric). I dabbled in the japanese rock scene back in HS, partly because I really liked the music, partly because it opened up a lot of opportunities for exploration. I didn't have the guts to go all the way though, but did some light makeup and had sort-of feminine haircuts.  Anyway, past HS this was all behind me, except in my art where I kept my aesthetic alive, though never consciously setting out to do so. I've since moved the canvas onto myself, so haven't picked up the pen much at all lately.   Fast forward 10 years or so, and I'm standing at a graduation ceremony. I work as a teacher, and I'm saying goodbye to my students, since summer break is about to come up. All teachers are lined up, and I look at my female colleagues and feel a real sting of jealousy. I'm standing there dressed in a shirt and pants while they're wearing lovely dresses, with earrings, makeup and bags.  I decided enough was enough, and went and bought nail polish the same day, and booked a time to pierce both my ears the day after. This all coincided with a long solo trip to Japan, where I bought a ton of makeup and really started to let lose. I also started (slowly) incorporating female cuts and items into my wardrobe, but every step needed quite a bit of courage, heck they still do. My comfort zone has blown wide open but anything beyond what I wear regularly gives some slight anxiety.  Then in 2020 I started posting here, getting feedback and help, and through constant cheering from colleagues, friends and students I finally feel like anxiety isn't keeping me away from expressing myself the way I want.  &#x200B;  So yeah, kind of a tangent, but that's my fashion fantasy coming true.

text:What are your favorite, trusted clothing lines for buying wear-forever investment classics?	labels:For basics: in my experience Lands End has consistently good quality for the price point, especially considering their constant 40% off sales.   I have several Eileen Fisher items secondhand and they're all fabulous, well made, durable. I dont have a lot of experience with items purchased new in that price range to compare to.  When the apocalypse comes and nothing is left of me, my cheerful cherry red Patagonia pants will still be cheerful cherry red and perfectly intact around my charred outline.  Have also been generally happy with Boden and Talbots.  My one pair of Everlane dress pants has held up very nicely for a few years.  For knits, I'm still on the lookout.  I have a 10 year old American Apparel t shirt I've worn heavily that is slight faded but not a single pill and the neckline is as flat as the day it was born.  However I can't support LA Apparel anymore and more recent American Apparel is not like that anymore.  I have a few knits from secondhand Lilla P which is pricier new but they have also held up very well.    I haven't found my new white whale for knits yet.  May try American Giant, Kotn, or Fair Indigo next.  I have knits from Pact more recently which are middling and I like that they are organic and affordable, I think they accomplish that with material that tends to be thinner.

text:I want to to learn sewing so I can tailor my own clothes such as shirts, pants, jackets.  Maybe make some denim for fun.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:If money were no object? Bespoke or haute couture?	labels:Haute Couture is generally women’s clothing and is defined by a fine garment entirely made by hand.   Bespoke is generally what you mean, and a lot of high end brands will offer this service (often called made to measure). While you may not find this in all categories of clothing, it’s a great way to get a perfect fit in a garment you want to last. Suits, coats, shirts and trousers are generally available and you can normally choose your fit, fabric, details etc.. this however doesn’t mean the garment is any better than something you’d find off the rack - rather it’s more suited to your taste and body type. You can get bespoke made in Asia suits for a few hundred to fine Italian tailoring into the thousands.   Don’t underestimate the power of a good tailor however. Almost all garments off the rack can be tailored to fit you better. Rarely will something be perfect - so buy what you love in as close as fit as possible and rely on your tailor to refine it for you.	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 09, 2020	labels:I'm normally a 38S/32W for suits, but I've found this suit I'm obsessed with that's only available in 40S/34W. Is this a small enough difference that a tailor would be able to adjust?
text:Unlikely. The trousers would be fine, going down a size at the waist is normally do able. The jacket is unlikely to be able to be tailored to fit unless a 38 is normally verging on too small in the shoulders, the shoulders are going to be the main (expensive) problem.

text:What are some differences between stereotypical Millennial and Gen Z fashion/aesthetics?	labels:Wow I feel like maybe I’m dressing too young for my age now! I’m 32 and fit the gem Z aesthetic with the millennial perspective (sustainable & quality) I hate skinny jeans. They looked great on me in my 20s but after kids and gaining 10lbs I look so dumpy in them. Wide leg & high waisted balances my proportions and you need a high quality crop top or bodysuit to show off that high waist jean (I’m short so the crop tops I wear show hardly any skin). I do love a nice cardigan or sweater with some trousers, tie waist and wide leg is a plus! I love the sweat pant trend but I keep it for at home. I also love a slip dress or maxi dress in the summer. I live and die in cardigans.	episode_done:True
text:How do you style/match your footwear with your outfit ? Do you use colour blocking method ?	labels:Back in the day when I used to where heels to work... I had a bright pink pair of hell's and bright red ones, along with nuetrals. I don't think I generally matched them to similar coloured things, I more leaned towards thinking about what colour goes well with them. One fave outfit was all black with a bright turquoise coloured statement necklace. The tourquoise went well with both the pink or red shoes. Or black dress with a beige or very light pick cardigan. I also had some different shades of blue blouses that would work, but the focus was on whether I thought the colours looked good together.  Pretty much all my skirts and pants are nuetral (I count navy as a nuetral). I have quite cool undertones to my skin so there are a lot of colours that I don't think look good on me, which has resulted in my clothing colours all kind of falling into similar colour families and being easy to pair together.	episode_done:True

text:Difficulty distinguishing between so 'idealized' style and personal style?	labels:I too used to struggle distinguishing between idealized style and personal style. I would be lying if I said I had it all figured out right now but I’ve made major progress. First off, I looked at my closet and identified that I unknowingly had a color scheme of sorts (think black, white, maroon, olive green, and a mustard yellow) I always seem to gravitate towards clothes such as these so now whether I’m picking a fancier dress or just some joggers I tend to get ones in these colors. Honestly your style is whatever you want to make it. Go out of your comfort zone or stay in your comfort zone. It is totally up to you don’t let anyone or anything dictate it!	episode_done:True

text:What I Like is Not What I choose to wear	labels:Do the people on your inspiration boards look like you? (Similar body type, coloring, etc.) They don't have to all look like you, but if most of them look super different then it's going to be hard to map the inspo board style onto yourself.  I have a slim hourglass figure (SORRY FFACJ) and the main thing for me has been learning how to take a look I like and then do it in a way that feels flattering - so for pants that would probably be a medium-high waist, a boxy jacket that is slightly tapered at the waist, etc. I rely on tailoring and alterations for that, but I also have to start with off-the-rack clothes that are close to fitting. I've been shopping vintage Thierry Mugler and Vivienne Westwood. I avoid anything too vintage because it can look a bit rockabilly/pin-up, but it depends on your style.  The other part is if the style of the clothing you like fits your self image, or if it fits the image of someone you'd like to be temporarily, but doesn't feel like "you," if that makes sense. There are a lot of aesthetics I like but I know I wouldn't feel like myself in them.
text:I never thought about this! I generally think that people should be able to wear whatever they want regardless of whether something “flatters” them in the traditional sense, but now that I’m reevaluating this I can see how this has prevented me from wearing certain things.   For example, I LOVE - crisp white collared shirt but realIze I don’t often wear one because I have a larger bust and they often stretch across my chest in a way that doesn’t look good. I can see now that the looks ive been saving and pinning tend to be of thin women where this isn’t an issue for them.	labels:I do think you absolutely can wear anything! But it may just need to be a certain cut/length/silhouette/fabric to feel "just right." And unfortunately there just isn't that degree of variety in off-the-rack clothes. In your case a good tailor (or potentially a MTM tailoring service) could probably get you pretty close - especially if they do a reinforced bust closure. Then the question is just whether it feels right to you.	episode_done:True

Not super washed out colour, no tears or frays. Any kinds of studs etc would be acceptable though.  They’re always full of tears and rips, too short, ”110 cm chest width counts as oversize, right?”, washed-out colouring, not black, or something else. Should be a simple enough item but... no.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 04, 2020	labels:Recently bought a pair of the Bonobos Travel Jeans because they were on sale. They are the best fitting pair of pants I now have, mostly due to Bonobos fits and sizing (29/28 for a shorter than average dude, no hemming is a dream). Now that I’ve fallen in love with these pants it’s all I want. However, their price tag makes it hard for me to buy a few (if not on sale).  Are there any comparable companies with similar sizing and fits at a lower price point?
text:If you're in the States, I believe they run sales fairly frequently. To me, their main business model is offering an extensive range of fits/colours/sizes at a slight premium, since it costs money to produce all those variations. In that sense, there's not really a cheaper company that has 5 fits of pants for every colour, material, design, etc that they do.   If you're just worried about length, Uniqlo offers free hemming, and American Eagle has a pretty wide range of sizes as well.	labels:That’s what I think and what I might just do.

I also think pajama pants that are low slung on my hips are really flattering. And I usually sleep in tank tops. Again, they have to fit: if they’re too big, my boobs slide out.

text:On Leather Belts in Classic Menswear	labels:Hey guys!   I don’t know how it started, but I recently started collecting belts. It's a contrast against my custom commissions which typically feature side tabs! So I wrote a few thoughts about it, why it's different than clean cinchs (like side tabs and braces) and why I’ve always admired thin belts for their mid-century charm and slimming, “snatched-waist” effect.  The [podcast episode](https://soundcloud.com/styleanddirection/sad58/s-VbJszwH47tS) gets more the different types of ways to hold up your pants (like suspenders and cinch-backs) while my essay focuses much more on arguing for thin belts before going into engine turned buckles, reptile leathers, and western detailing. Honestly, I love the juxtaposition the latter does when worn with tailoring!  I hope you guys enjoy the essay/pod and that you get something out of it!

text:How has the quality changed over the years at some of your fav brands?	labels:So forever 21 used to be my favorite brand/store to shop at, and I'm honestly not quite sure if it's because I've grown older and started to notice quality or what, but I feel like the quality has gone way down.   Nowadays I 90% thrift, but whenever I do decide to enter a forever 21, I feel like everything is so cheap (also the store is just plain overwhelming) compared how it used to be when I shopped as a teenager. I'm honestly not sure if that's because of trends or markets or because I got older and started noticing it more.  I guess at the thrift store I'm exposed to several other brands that I can feel the difference between the two, but that's my best guess. So I don't think it's necessarily gone downhill, but it's more like I started noticing the actual quality in comparison to others.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 09, 2021	labels:Can somebody please point out what I'm doing wrong [here](https://imgur.com/a/XV3AgcA) re: proportions? Regular fit linen shirt in an XS (still too long so I tucked it), 32" slim fit jeans (also too long, and the leg openings seem obnoxiously large around my ankles and knees) and chunky sole converses. Full disclaimer--I'm trans so still sort of fumbling around when it comes to men's fashion. If I untuck the shirt it makes my torso look more proportional and my hips slimmer, but then my legs look stupidly short. The same outfit with skinny jeans makes me look taller but then my thighs look more curvy.
text:It's not bad. Overall, it's a little on the bottom-heavy side. You could try wearing a wider top, and then you'd look a little more balanced, but maybe shorter proportionally. You could wear the pants lower (at a lower "rise"), or find a shirt that sits shorter when untucked (try a brand like Asket).	labels:Thanks for the tips and the brand suggestion. I have tried wearing the jeans lower but then my inseam gets kind of rumpled which makes my legs look shorter.	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 06, 2021	labels:Hi all,  I’ve ordered some Fratelli Orsini leather gloves with a rabbit fur lining. First impressions are great, the lamb skin is amazing and the fur is soft. I ordered it perfectly to size, a size 9, or medium. My concern is that the glove fits very snug, and since the lining is thick, it makes it feel even less flexible on top of that. Will these stretch by quite a bit and offer more space? As it stands, I can’t comfortably make a fist with these gloves. For warmth, I don’t know if that’s a good thing and that I want it this tight or if I want extra space to work with instead.  I just don’t want to re-order a size up and then have THOSE gloves stretch so much over time that I have way TOO much room. For this reason should I just stick with what I have? Should I allow them to stretch and will they stretch enough to give me the space I need?	episode_done:True

text:Can you have a clothing style without actually wearing that certain style much?	labels:Opportunity is how you make it, it comes down to if whether you can take the time to dress yourself, and spend time shopping for quality clothes reflecting your style and personality, intead of the boredom/sadness induced spree for some dopamine.  I personally, made sure to dress well everyday of college for classes from 8 a.m. till 5 p.m., ofcourse there were days when I did not feel like doing so, or simply did not have the time. But, majority of the time, I did take the effort to plan my outfit, and I always could face the day with confidence no matter what was in store for me.  So, again, opportunity is different from the norm, if you want to go to the grocers looking like a million bucks, you should go ahead and do it, that is what will help you build your confidence and trust in your own style and choices. It's easier to take criticism when you look good, and feel good.  And honestly it is also okay to admire a certain style from afar and not want to adopt it in your wardrobe, without the pressure of people questioning your "loyalty". I, myself, am a fan of the classic minimal style, but I tend to dress more with an eclectic approach, eager to experiment.  To simply admire, or to actually imbibe style is a decision you have to take. Fashion is nothing if not self-expression, it should not be dictated by external factors.	episode_done:True

Some of my favorite clothing include trench coats and other bold but chic coats, tall sleek boots, fancy heeled sandals, and statement sweaters. There's not a lot of opportunity for me to wear some of these things unfortunately. As a student it's not really practical/appropriate to wear designer items, but I can totally envision myself getting into more expensive classics and handbags as I get older.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:BoF: J. Crew's New CEO has a Survival Plan: Edit out the Ugly	labels:I have a love/hate thing with J Crew. I was really into it for a few years (just out of college, had some disposable income, but didn't really know what I wanted to be or look like) then things started getting... Really fucking weird.   Want a neck ruffle? Have a stack of those things up near your head area, don't worry, your shoulders will look absolutely enormous! You don't need let anyone else know where your waist is, that's between us!  Here are the elastic waist accordian pleat skirts in patterns that you will force yourself to like, kinda (you hate them.) You can tuck the ruffle top in. Your aunt will tell you that you "look sharp."  Here's a $300 version of that coat from Amazon that all of the women from Urbanmommy liked for some reason eight years ago. It's not warm.   Have a popover! What's that? It's a half button down with absolutely zero shape. Just none. It's also real stiff, so, you know, deal with that. We will enthusiastically offer you ten of these because when a garment looks good with nothing it technically, legally, goes with everything.   Have a really large ruffled wrap skirt. It's practical for literally nothing. No workplace, no event, you'll buy it though, because it's fun! *It's khaki* because this is a J Crew, ma'am.  Wear this boatneck top off the shoulder! What? That looks really fucking stupid when you do it? It looked good in our editorial, you should really try it that way. It's $48.   Paperbag waist pants with enormous wide legs are available, and did you know you can just pull them all the way up over your head and cinch the ties? Like your own personal worry cubby. We want for you to dress like you are your anxiety disorder.   Here's an interesting top; it's a bag with arm holes and an oversized velvet tie. Just cinch it around your shoulders. It's chambray. Don't wash it, this is the best it'll ever look.   Remember Chanel jackets? We could've made a similar garment with decent tailoring and fine detailing, but we didn't do that. This one has fringe though!   It's the pirate dress that you bought because it was on sale! It's made of gauzy linen cotton forgettable fabric and it has a lace up placket in the front! It's like the tops that Reformation and Alexander Wang made last year but not really because it's just the lace up detail on a hospital gown.   I could keep going but I won't, I wish they'd just stop getting weird with it and would just produce well fitting, preppy basics at a mid range price point. A long time ago, I noticed as I was shopping that I would gravitate toward pieces that were well executed, regardless of design. Garments that did a good job of being what they were meant to be. J Crew used to do that, they haven't in awhile.  ETA: What I think that j crew gets wrong, and why I think the brand hasn't aged well, is that fast fashion brands and companies like ASOS stopped coddling consumers with watered down versions of the trends that they'd see on celebrities and in magazines (and later on social media) and simply gave them cheaper versions of those items. ASOS frequently has really daring, on trend pieces and they're well done. The quality isn't going to be on par with heritage brands or premier designers, and the clothes aren't exact replicas, but they're dupes and they're fun and they're accessible. Things that 15 years ago you really couldn't hope to own at an average income are available in a much more egalitarian way, and I can understand why people look a J Crew, with those very safe, neutered versions of high fashion designs at their price points and take a pass.
text:Thank you for savaging the popover. I hate those things.	labels:They're fucking terrible. It's like if milquetoast sex was a casual top, like it's there, you'll do it, but you get really nothing out of it. And what kills me is that virtually any time women's fashion is complained about on the internet, invariably someone says something like, I really want a nice, fitted, classic, simple button down shirt that doesn't bunch or gape or have weird three quarter sleeves or a massive collar or a large satin bow on it, and j crew looked at that cry for help and created the fucking popover. Some dude in a board room was like, "the ladies will love it and we'll save on the buttons, the buttons are where they get ya" and here we are.	episode_done:True
text:Experience with fast fashion brands for office casual clothes (Shein, Fashion Nova, etc)?	labels:I haven't yet shopped FashionNova/Shein. But have spent plenty of time shopping cheaper brands like Target, Old Navy, NY and Co, Kohls, H&M, Forever21. And honestly I have plenty of things from these places that have held up fine. Especially when you follow wash instructions and avoid the dryer as much as possible.   Even cheaper stores have some gems among the low quality items.  The biggest issue I found is that certain things needed to be replaced like annually or sometimes 2x a year. But on the other hand some stuff will just last forever. I had (have) some decade+ stuff from all of those places that still get worn.  Some were super frequent, some weren't.  Now that I am a bit older - I realize there are a few things I always wear - vetted by years of experience - that is makes sense to spend more on. I'll always use a black cardigan, grey cardigan, and black knit pencil skirt (ponte or similar) year over year - so those can be upgrade picks. But as for dresses? My vibe changes often so I am ok at saving on those and trading them out as I see fit. There are some that live in my closet forever, but really as long as I have a couple of black/white print dress options I am happy!	episode_done:True

text:Let's talk the impact of fragrance on perception of style! How much does a person's fragrance affect your impression of them? Do you choose perfume with this in mind? What are some of your favourites?	labels:Context; I’m a designer, and I work closely with a perfumery. I’ve always had a relationship to scent, and the sway it can have with balancing a good outfit or how it can make me feel better about a bad outfit... does anyone else have “I didn’t shower today” perfume?  That said, like some others have commented here, I’m a big fan of both “scent is meant to be discovered” and also using scent to turn the dial on an outfit. My personal aesthetic definitely veers towards “grandma who carries a knife” and I have specific scents that I know work with me (musks, resins, masculine / heady florals and moss) so I choose those in accordance with how I’m feeling and what I’m wearing that day, like dirty florals / resins with off-white linens and lace, or lighter amber or powdery labdanum with all black and leather.  It’s a subtle thing.   It definitely hurts when you see someone dressed beautifully, and up close they smell off. This is especially prevalent with dating for me, and will turn me off of someone even when they’re dressed well.  Not that I specifically look for someone who wears perfume / cologne, but more on the general hygiene side of things. If they dress well, and are super attractive, but smell bad or don’t have that distinctive scent to remind me of them (whether that be deodorant, laundry detergent, lotion, perfume etc) then some pheromone magic is missing. Scent, even fabricated or chosen, is such a powerful form of emotional connection!
text:"Grandma who carries a knife" is an amazing way of describing an aesthetic!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:If money were no object? Bespoke or haute couture?	labels:I think /u/Ghoticptox pretty much summed it up perfectly, nothing to really add. I personally have no interest in bespoke because I value design more than minuscule fit details, I think this sub has a tendency to overemphasize how important fit actually is, especially considering how nebulous of a concept “good fit” even is.  Like, the fit “issues” you highlighted,   >shoulder tiny bit broad in one coat, a little extra material in the waist of another.  Are complete non issues to me, that’s just variance in fit and design, I wouldn’t blink at that on a piece I otherwise really love.  The more important thing to me, and I can’t believe no one else has mentioned this yet, your friend got into clothing a couple months ago, he doesn’t even know what he likes, it sounds like, and I mean this judgement free, he’s just going around looking for the most expensive thing he can find, I don’t think we’d recommend anyone go and buy a $4000 coat right as they’re getting into fashion. Like, is he rich enough that he can afford to make that work or rich enough that it literally doesn’t matter? Because I think unless $4000 is something you can spend in a day and not blink itms probably not a good idea to go and drop $4000 and a true bespoke coat when he could end up getting into streetwear in 3 months and never wear it again. At least in that case something like YSL will retain value better and can be sold for more, as opposed to a lot of traditional tailoring brands, which go for pennies on the dollar on the used market	episode_done:True

Limited edition, haven’t been able to find them since.   Stuffed a fish oil pill in my pocket without thinking when my niece went after it. Someone threw the jumpsuit in the wash without checking.

text:What’s your favorite winter fashion staple?	labels:I’m from Minnesota and I can relate to the winter fashion struggle lol. I’m a huge bargain hunter because I’m on that college student budget but I find winter outerwear to be one area where you mostly get what you pay for, although there are deals to be had. Layers are your best friend.  A pair of straight leg or mom jeans will probably leave you enough space to wear a pair of fleece lined leggings underneath to keep you toasty. Wool or cashmere sweaters in tight knits as opposed to more open weaves, with a tight long sleeve tshirt or long underwear shirt underneath. Riding boots with enough calf space to wear long wool socks underneath if you prefer skinny jeans/pants or dresses/skirts. I thrift a lot of this stuff or buy it at outlet stores (Nordstrom Rack, Marshall’s, etc).  A high-quality wool coat in a neutral color is definitely a worthwhile investment if you don’t like the look of down parkas. I got mine from a local outlet for $80 (90% off!) and it stands up really well to cold weather. I have a really good sized collection of winter accessories (hats, gloves, etc.) and I buy some cheap stuff in trendy colors/styles from Marshall’s once a year. I’m keeping an eye out for some faux leather gloves in a fun color for this year! That said, I think decent quality leather/faux leather gloves lined with a wool or cashmere blend and a hat and scarf in wool or cashmere are also good to have. They definitely keep me warmer than the cheap stuff. I have good luck at Sierra Trading Post (same company as Marshall’s/TJMaxx but focused on outdoorsy stuff) for that kind of thing.	episode_done:True
text:Lower quality items during Nordstrom Anniversary Sale?	labels:There are a few brands that do this (Vince and Theory are the ones I've encountered...). Back when I worked in a more formal industry I was shopping for a Theory suit. At Nordstrom Rack the suit was unlined and a wool/poly blend. At Nordstrom the suit was wool with a poly half-lining. And at the Theory flagship in NYC the suit was pure wool with some natural or cellulose full lining (it's been a few years... but it definitely wasn't poly). This was ostensibly the same suit - similar silhouette and the same name, just a few numbers on the product ID differed. And of course the fit when I tried them on was noticeably different, from the Rack one being like a very cheap imitation, the Nordstrom one being pretty good, and the flagship one fitting like a glove.   Similarly, I recently bought some AllSaints moto boots from 6pm fully expecting them to be a diluted version. Instead they were the same cow leather lined with goat leather I tried in store. Considering how these things usually go, a happy surprise (no way in hell are they worth the $450 at full price). Side note: 6pm secretly lists most of their stock on Amazon with Prime fulfillment, which is great because their return policy sucks.
text:Can you link to their amazon store?	labels:I'm not sure if it will get blocked as a referral link... But here's an example of a different shoe, since the one I got is out of stock: [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07WN9WBR1/](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07WN9WBR1/)   Here's the 6pm storefront, it's super hard to navigate: [https://www.amazon.com/s?me=A2BMBHD2OU3XDU&marketplaceID=ATVPDKIKX0DER](https://www.amazon.com/s?me=A2BMBHD2OU3XDU&marketplaceID=ATVPDKIKX0DER)  I can't tell if it's just poor implementation or purposefully difficult to navigate. The best bet is to search on 6pm and then try searching some different keywords or product codes to find the same one on Amazon.	episode_done:True

The floor is hard and I got sore wearing slippers or bare feet.   I don’t have shoes which are not comfortable.	episode_done:True
text:If money were no object? Bespoke or haute couture?	labels:In this hypothetical I'd go with haute couture. In your friend's situation I'd keep looking until I found a designer I liked. Bespoke would be my last option for a couple of reasons. Your friend wants contemporary fashion, but most bespoke tailors make traditional clothes for a typically older crowd (you're in NYC though so there are some bespoke tailors catering to a younger crowd; make sure you look for them specifically). The bespoke tailors catering to a younger crowd don't have designs as good as high end ready to wear IMO. Tailoring and designing are different skills, and there's a reason Louis Vuittion, YSL, Dior, Gucci, etc pay their head designers millions per year. Of course some $4000 coats are worth more than others, so it would be good to know a bit about general quality.  Personally, I prioritize design over fit. I can deal with a less than perfect fit if I love the design of a piece. But I won't wear a piece if I don't love the design, even if it fits well.   The middle ground option is made to measure, or MTM. MTM for outerwear isn't as common for suiting, but it's out there.

text:Changing your mindset from fast fashion to one of investment pieces. What did you learn?	labels:One of the big things I learned is that there's a lot less room for error or experimentation with investments. I feel pretty fortunate that I had a pretty good idea of what I liked and didn't like, but I think if you're still wanting to experiment then it may be best to stick with very specific investments. For example, I started just with shoes (I have strong preferences) and outerwear (I wanted to upgrade shapes/colors I already loved). That'll help build confidence in moving to other areas.
text:I second what you're saying about experimenting. I want to go a step further and say this advice definitely isn't applicable to everyone, especially because we are all in different stages of life, and it's a bit of a privileged take on fashion. I'm not a law student, but I'm a second-year PhD student pursuing a career in academia. My stipend works out to $13 an hour. From my understanding, law students aren't paid a stipend at all? Anyway, on $13/hour, I'm getting my basics at TJMaxx or the clearance rack at Target (and I honestly don't think it makes my outfits look cheap or not put-together, you just have to style it right, but I guess I could be wrong). I'm simply not in a position where it's at all sensible to buy one well-made sweater instead of five cheap tops. If I did this, I'd have like...two very nice shirts and that's it. It's more important to me to have at least a week's worth of different outfits and be able to look presentable than it is to wear expensive clothes that I'll still have in 10 years. In a few years, I will hopefully be a professor and making a lot more money, and then I'll actually make the transition to "investment pieces." But I don't think it's necessarily wise to suggest to someone entering grad school to dump a bunch of money into high-quality clothes.	labels:To add to this, most people don’t actually need expensive professional wear for their careers like we think we will when we’re in college - offices are becoming more casual by the second. I really encourage young women to wait until you have a job lined up you need clothes for before specifically purchasing workwear and even then, start slow. Your preferences will change when you learn your office runs hot or cold or you have to layer because your conference room is 15 degrees warmer than your cube. And the stated dress code may be much different than the actual dress code!!  I have so many clothes I bought in my early 20s and wasted SO much money when I thought I was going to need to dress super professional that would look completely ridiculous and out of place in the actual offices I’ve worked in. Looking back I think I had an ideal of what dressing like a grown up would be like and wanted to feel like I fit in! Totally makes me laugh now!  While I don’t agree with every element I do appreciate OPs take because breaking the Maxxinista in me who bought things because they were cheap and “okay” was REALLY difficult - turning the focus to things that were cheap and great is the new jam and so much better! Poshmark and ebay are awesome for that, especially if you have a specific brand in mind.	episode_done:True
text:Is anyone else intimidated by maximalism? I love it, but how do you do it?	labels:I love bold colors and big prints and have worn them for years. However, I am only just starting to mix prints and my color combinations are very much based on elementary school color wheels still. I know other people can mix and match in much wilder ways that I do. So I'm not sure I'm the best person since I'm still learning myself. But, here goes...  1. A lot of mixing and matching around the house. I challenge myself to not just assume pieces won't work together. I actually put them on and try to look at them from different angles and in different lights. I can usually determine if the look is just totally "off" or if it works or if it is headed in the right direction, but maybe needs to be tweaked first (like, maybe stripes and checks *can* work, but the checks need to be a different size or something).   2. Dresses are great! Because they're one item, they can have big wild crazy patterns or prints without needing to figure out how to match them up with other pieces. I still use them when I want to look creative but am too lazy to actually *be* creative. They were great for learning about what types of patterns and prints I like.  3. I pick color *or* print. I know others do both and look great, but for me--and for the environment I'm generally in, where people dress in a lot of jeans and t-shirts, so I already stand out a bit--just having one "big" thing is enough. I'll do bright cobalt pants and a grassy green sweater to work, but I wouldn't do a cobalt-and-red striped skirt and green-and-red polka dotted top, for example. (Not sure I would ever do that combo, tbh, but someone might pull it off!)  4. Texture and fabric can be maximalist too. One of my favorite outfits for summer is monochrome--everything a creamy white--but there are at least four different textures going on, so (I think) it seems much more interesting and not so boring. A winter combo I'm dying to try is tweed and velvet.  5. Accessories! I know the big statement necklace look is dated, but I love using jewelry to add to outfits. They're not so much of a commitment, in my opinion. Prue Leith, from Great British Bakeoff, is a good example of someone who uses accessories like necklaces and eyeglasses to elevate outfits.  6. Breaking up the whacky pieces. Again, other people can just pile it all on, but I don't think it works for me (at least not yet--maybe someday!) But if I'm wearing two "statements" I'll make sure there is neutral/boring in between. So, a big interesting necklace that hits higher on my neck, a plain top, and then wild patterned pants. Or a dress with a crazy print that hits above my knees, then bare legs or solid tights, then super fun shoes.   7. Working maximalism into exisiting style. One of my early mistakes was thinking that because I love pattern and color, I'd love *all* patterns and color in my closet. I don't! Paisley just isn't for me. Tie dye, generally speaking, doesn't fit my overall aesthetic. I'm still on the preppier end of things, I am still "quirkier" than "chic", I use fashion, at least on occasion, to be a visual signal that I'm queer. So, knowing that, a long boho flowing dress in ikat print may look magical in pictures, but it just doesn't fit in my closet. I'm much more likely to pull out a red button-up dress with zebras printed on it, button it to the top, and throw on an embroidered duster and glittery boots...  8. Mistakes are going to be made. I look back on some photos and outfits and absolutely cringe. I didn't know what I was doing, or I was just trying to match an outfit from a magazine using what I had in my closet. It didn't work. But I lived to talk about it and everything is fine. So, unless it's for a special occasion, I don't worry too much if it doesn't work out the way I thought it would. It's an outfit, that's all!	episode_done:True

You don't have to spend a fortune on new clothes (target is fine).  Women do not tend to wear khakis down here.  Loose linen pants would probably feel good though.  Colors will be brighter, bring sunglasses.  New Orleans will be a swamp most of the year, so whatever you would pack for a beach vacation.  You don't need snow anything (shoes, coat), maybe a light jacket for the colder months.  I didn't use my wool coat for a couple years, it wasn't cold enough.  You could probably get away with a wool sweater and layers under if it dips to the 30s and you're still acclimated to cold weather.  Yes to a light cotton or linen cardigan for the AC.

text:Underwear review: Soma vs. Parade after 6 months	labels:If anyone is looking for cotton underwear, I recently purchased a few pairs from [Knickey](https://knickey.com) and [ARQ](https://shoparq.com). I’m officially an old (in my early 30s) and was looking for comfortable cotton underwear to wear bed or under dresses. I prefer high rise underwear because I have a long torso and wear mostly high waisted pants. I still wear thongs (mostly Hanky Panky retro thong) with tight fitting bottoms.   Knickey is more “affordable” at $13 a pair. I purchased the mid rise and high rise briefs. I was surprised that the mid rise was about as high as other brands high rise (Aerie for example). High rise hits right below my belly button. Thinner cotton compared to ARQ, but very comfortable for me. I have a larger butt but I haven’t has issues with wedgies (an issue I’ve had with other brands). Putting them through the dryer did shrink them a little (I tested one pair first because I know I’m lazy and will eventually throw them in the dryer). Overall they feel way better than the mall brands I’ve tried the past few years.   ARQ is definitely more expensive at $28 a pair. They also only offer one style (high rise brief). The style is more “retro” and definitely high rise. They actually go above my belly button. The fabric is thick and the stitching is really impressive. Very comfortable, no wedgies. I have been machine drying them with no issues.  I love the single pair I purchased.   I am actually really happy with both purchases. ARQ is too expensive for me to fill my underwear drawer with, but I may get a second pair soon.  Oh, I did buy [The Reformation](https://www.thereformation.com) mid rise thong to test out. It’s not cotton, but I was curious. It’s ok. Not high enough rise for my taste, but comfortable. I wouldn’t repurchase though.

They don’t shrink in the wash either which is a huge problem I have with my pajamas. There are only a couple things I swear by at Walmart and that’s one of them. I also really like CuddlDuds, they’re cute and they can be found at Kohl’s. If you do an Amazon return there you get a 15% or 25% coupon, which is how I discovered them.
text:I don't often go to Walmart but one thing I will say is that their sizing is very inclusive and they have a lot of styles appropriate to a large variety of age ranges.  This is something that a lot of shops could learn from.  A lot of the brands being recommended here (no shade) have very limited sizing.  As for CuddlDuds, I have some and they're one of my cozy options. :)	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What did people *actually* wear in 2000's?	labels:In 2000 I was wearing low rise flared jeans in a dirty stone wash, paired with leopard print stiletto boots and a beige jumper. There was a lot of dirty wash denim and beige in the early days.  By the time I went to uni in 2002 things had shifted to dirty stone wash and piglet pink, or khaki and pink. Girls Aloud hit the scene in late 2002 and I was working in New Look. That combined with Christina Aguilera's Dirrrrrty look and well. I had a pair of brown cord low rise flares and some black pointed kitten heels that I wore a lot.  At the same time, I was also into ska punk and indie so wore a lot of baggy jeans, trainers and tshirts. Avril Lavigne was on the radio a lot. There was a lot of colour, in muted tones.   Things changed when I started working for Lush and spent a lot more time wearing all black to work. Realised I liked it and carried that over more into my non work life.   Mid 2000s I graduated from uni and started working so veered into smart casual for work. Started going to metal nights at weekends and leaned into the style from there which ranged from baggy jeans and graphic tshirts for casual nights to full on lace and corsets for nights when we went big.  By the time I turned 25 in 2008 I was getting divorced, dating someone else, and my style was starting to shift a bit. Had a period of more colour towards the end of the 2000s but then the skinny jeans and long jumpers/tunics came back from their early 90s grave and I eventually jumped on that bandwagon. That one has stuck the most  albeit with some modifications and adjustments over the years.

text:Winter jackets that are good for skiing and casual use?	labels:Holden, Burton, Volcom, Helly Hansen, 686, quicksilver, O’Neill.... wide range of fashions here. Definitely go for something to layer under rather than insulated. Water proof, breathable and then a look that you like. Avoid loud patterns unless you’re ok with it quickly going out of style. I like stuff in a solid color or two tone but that’s just me. Keys to consider are pockets that fit all the shit you want to carry, whether you will be wearing it with a helmet and general fit (I like my stuff on the baggier side but that can make it weird when pairing with other gear in the city). Avoid gimmicky tech, ie. I don’t need my jacket to have a bottle opener attached to it!

text:Do You Ever See A Cute Outfit, Try To Replicate It And End Up Hating It On Yourself? How Did You Fix That? Did You Ever Get The Answer As To Why It Didn't "Look Right" On You?	labels:In addition to what others have said about body type which I think are true and important, I also find the quality of product important. If I am following an influencer, their clothes are probably more expensive than mine usually are, and if I find a cheaper product that is similar, it doesn't have the same fine touches that make the difference. The whole outfit can end up looking cheap.  I've realized that when I shop for something in particular, including to replicate something I saw, I end up settling for something that kind of looks like what I'm looking for but doesn't "wow" me. I've learned to keep an eye out for pieces that really let me feel something instead of just deciding if it kind of looks like something else I liked.
text:This is very good advice. Certain things, like blazers or cashmere sweaters don't translate well to more affordable options. I think the same thing goes for sundresses.

text:Pantone Color(s) of the year for 2021: Illuminating and Ultimate Gray	labels:I love yellow & I love gray, in most shades, but these in particular just feel so... textbook Crayola starter pack to me? Like, in a vacuum they could be the platonic ideal of yellow and gray, so I can kind of appreciate how they are both true mid-tones, but I don't like them together (for some reason it's giving me flashbacks to the chevrons and turquoise of 2010 decor) and I don't find them particularly inspiring right off the bat.  Or it could be that as a warm-toned olive I know they will both look terrible on me, lol.
text:Yeah personally I felt it had potential (might be kinda basic at this point, but I really like light or charcoal gray and mustard yellow together, for instance.) But I just wasn't into this particular combo. Made me think of highlighter on graphite.	labels:They're exactly the color of highlighter and pencil lead!	episode_done:True
text:Do you follow the conventional rules around "flattering your figure?"	labels: A lot of women (myself included) opt out of fashions that are not flattering.  However, choosing to wear something that is fashionable, even though it doesn't look good on me seems an odd choice, unless one is *really* into fashion for fashion's sake.
text:I think seeing wearing things you like as *odd* because it's not flattering is a very limiting way to look at it.   If someone likes something, why is *flattering* more important than *fun* or *enjoyable*? We don't have to be 100% sexually and aesthetically attractive at all times.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:What is your ideal first date outfit?	labels:I usually wear knee length trousers when i'm not at work, even in winter - if it's cold i just wear knee sox.  So my ideal first date outfit are my combat boots which i normally shine beforehand, black knee length cargo trousers, and my favourite black blouse.  I also have a violet tank tops i can wear underneath a black bolero style sweater i call my "first date sweater".  It's sort of fishnet-y, but it buttons directly below my breasts which highlights them nicely while skimming over my unpleasant midsection.  This is slightly fancier than i might wear to hang out with friends for a movie or drinks, since i'm a tshirt style person, but less fancy than a night out dancing.	episode_done:True
text:Your favourite men's style shopping "hacks"	labels:**Secondhand sites** - eBay, Grailed, TheRealReal, etc. You can either find brand new items at great prices or gently used items also at great prices.   **Shopping Portals** - If you're going to buy it from a major store checkout cashback websites (Rakuten (formerly eBates), TopCashBack, etc. Many large stores have 10% or more cash back.  **Credit Card Benefits** - AMEX specifically has a lot of offers that say spend X amount, get X amount back. I've seen in the past, J. Crew, Farfetch, Mr. Porter, Macy's, Saks, Neiman Marcus, etc.
text:Ooh, those cashback sites are something I wasn't aware of. Unfortunately the two you listed (Rakuten and TopCashBack) aren't fully available in the EU; Rakuten is disabled due to GDPR and TopCashBack redirects you to UK sites which sometimes don't let you ship to EU destinations.  Does anyone know of any EU equivalents? What was your experience using them like?	labels:If anyone is reading this in the future, I signed up for TopCashBack the day I posted this and was disappointed to see that it redirected me to the Kooples UK site (which doesn't ship to the EU). Yesterday I bought something from their EU site and was surprised to get an e-mail from TopCashBack saying I'd received credit for it.

I have a go- to shop for that where the sizing is consistent. I go there and get said item. that's it.  Scenario B is where I can't find the item I want easily. I browse the website/ wander aimlessly at the mall, than I get something completly unrelated. Sometimes these items turn out to be favorites, but more often than not I end up not wearing them. Cherry on top, sometimes I feel bad about having unworn clothing. I proceed and attempt to DIy them, destroying them completly in the process. I should really quit doing that.	episode_done:True

text:Advice needed: How to keep up with trends without social media?	labels:I think just by shopping you can stay on top of trends. You can also curate a list of resources you like (magazines, bloggers, etc.) and sign up for their newsletters.  I've also found a lot of joy recently in looking at physical magazines, which kind of feels like a dying medium. Barnes and Noble always used to have a really diverse set of fashion magazines available, including ones from other countries.

text:What's your fashion tragedy?	labels:Well, a tragedy for my wallet. I impulse bought a $200 pair of Doc Marten boots (the most I've ever spent on any item of clothing..) because they looked so cool and I love boots in general. I convinced myself I would wear them every day in winter so it would be worth it.   Yeah... They're heavy and uncomfortable af after a while, and squeak horribly on wooden floors. I still feel so silly about buying them when I consider that, usually, comfortable is very high up my list of musts for clothing and shoes. I've worn them about four times in three years. Still need to try sell them online.   An effective lesson in taking a few days to consider expensive items I suppose 😬

Rn the list is: - Prairie Creek state park - Avenue of the Giants / Humbolt Redwoods state park - Point Reyes - Monterey / Caramal - Point Lobos - Big Sur (pfeiffer beach and McWay falls) - Maybe Morro Bay  On the way back we’ll probably take the 5 instead and spend more of our time on the Oregon coast.
text:The Central Coast is a place best spent with leisure. You have to accept that you're not in a hurry to go anywhere to really appreciate it.  I personally tend to get either tritip in the general SLO area or sandwiches. Firestone is a local tritip favorite, although I really like AG Meat Co. There are a bunch of different sandwich shops in San Luis with their own different advantages, but if I had to pick only one it would be High Street Deli. I imagine most of these places will be largely closed though due to the recent covid orders, so check ahead of time.  Avila Beach is a nice little area that's where the locals go.  Also this is my carefully crafted 101 playlist, which applies to PCH as well: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4BbSQ7QEKG6AreQNvQWF04?si=q-SfjKzJRaWDrpmCZScO6g	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Share what are your quick tips to always look polished !	labels:I have 2 pups and have accepted that I will always have dog hair on me.   Back when I wore more business clothes, I would have separate at home and work clothes. Changed out of my work clothes as soon as I got home and into sturdier/less expensive outfits.   Also recommend keeping a lint roller in the car.   To generally look polished: add an accessory like a scarf, earrings or a necklace.   I’m also a fan of tucking shirts/sweaters.
text:IKEA lint rollers. They last a while, they’re cheap, they work. I buy them literally by the dozen. All bathrooms, bedroom, living room, car, office (back when we still went to an office).	labels:Yes 🙌   The IKEA ones do a good job too	episode_done:True
text:Rant - I'm fed up with fashion and "expressing myself"	labels:Have you thought about uniform dressing? I'm not talking about a boring black t-shirt and jeans every day. I wear a dress, sweater, and black pair of shoes every day. In the winder I add tights/leggings and an ankle book (summer is black sandals). I never have to think too much about what I wear and I don't really have to make any decisions after I purchase the item. My dresses are really comfortable, all of them have pockets, and I get compliments constantly. Uniform dressing sounds really boring, but you can create a fun and unique type of uniform if you want.  I tried a capsule wardrobe earlier this summer. It had dresses, shirts, pants and shorts, but I went back just dresses because the capsule was too many decisions. I just pick a dress that is clean and move on with my day, but I also still have a distinct and unique style.
text:It helped me a lot to realize that I don't need to have every piece, wear every color, or try every trend. It's better to curate a personal style that suits you and that you enjoy, regardless of what's trendy or not. Clothing that fits well but isn't on-trend will look much better than trendy pieces that don't fit. It's also better to invest in higher quality clothing for pieces that you'd like to last. H&M and Zara mass-produce clothing to fit with quickly changing trends, and they just don't put a lot of resources towards quality or fit. It's great if you need a club dress that you know you'll only wear occasionally, or for an accent piece that won't stay in your wardrobe for a long time. But you'll want better quality in pieces that you wear every day.  What do you actually \*like\* to wear? And what pieces do you actually need to suit your lifestyle? For example, I hate shorts, so I only keep two pairs for camping trips, and they are cheap. I don't like high heels, so I don't buy them. But I keep my work blazers for several years and wear each of them at least once per week, so I make sure that those are higher quality, and I'm a lot pickier about what fabrics and cuts I like.  It also helps to figure out which colors are flattering on you and/or that you enjoy, and try to mostly stick to buying those. If you stick to a specific color palette you can get to a point where matching is no longer work, and everything just kind of coordinates with each other. I do a lot of black, burgundy, and dark purple, so everything I purchase tends to coordinate with those colors.  I try to be realistic about how much clothing I need based on how often I wear it. Pre-pandemic, my closet featured a lot of office clothes, a couple fun going out dresses, two pairs of jeans and some casual shirts for weekends, and a couple workout outfits for the gym. Make a plan based on how many outfits or pieces you actually need, and then stick to it, replacing items as they wear out or if your lifestyle has a dramatic change (transitions like university to the job market, or a switch from a formal office to a more casual one, traditional office to working from home, having children, etc.) that changes your clothing needs.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - December 09, 2020	labels:God the shade towards fashion students in that thread was annoying.   I don’t mind if people didn’t like what Burberry did, but why shade fashion students **in a fashion sub**??   Do they not realize these people are working to be the same people that designed clothes that ultimately trickled to the blandness they wear?   Not only does it reek of typical tech-bro toxicity, but so reminiscent of Andy in that Devil Wears Prada scene about the cerulean blue sweater.

text:What are your thoughts on outfit repeating multiple days in a row?	labels:I'm adverse to the idea of it because "ew, dirty" is my knee-jerk reaction even though it's very likely that many people could easily re-wear without their clothing being gross. A person of Asian descent (with their special non-BO production genes) that works an office job and doesn't drop food all over themselves like I do could probably be perfectly hygenic re-wearing the same blouse multiple times in a row.  I don't think re-wearing clothes would have professional ramifications in my specialty (data storage specialist / DBA - computer/technical field). It would likely be noticed (especially for women who do it), possibly commented on, but the negative impact would likely be minuscule.   I did do it *once*, since I just grabbed the first shirt I found out of the clean laundry, and it was commented on. I just stared blankly at the person who commented and another of my teammates asked if the commentor had heard of a washing machine. I don't know that that would work if I did that regularly, though; I'd probably need to try to own it in a humorous way instead.	episode_done:True

text:2020 Gift Megathread	labels:I need help thinking of some gifts for my boyfriend and his family! I am getting him a basketball jersey, guitar pedal, and maybe an amaro that he likes but I want to get him one or two more smaller things. In the past i have given him books, winter pajamas, shirts, concert tickets. He is difficult to shop for because he really doesn’t care about material things and never really wants anything. He likes basketball, economics, traveling, music, reading, football but not as much as basketball. I was thinking of maybe a shirt? Does  anyone know of any brands similar to Fred Perry or Lyle & Scott available in Europe?   Also for his parents, I have absolutely no idea, I usually get them wine but I’d like to get them something else. They’re in their late 50s and going out to restaurants/traveling isn’t an option at the moment. He has two younger siblings that I want to get something small for, both in their early 20s, I was thinking maybe a little makeup gift box for his sister but have no idea for his bother. Men are difficult lol.   Thank you!!

text:What types of dresses would it be practical to have on hand for common different wedding types?	labels:Not white, not red and depending on area, not black. White and red are the bride's colors (culturally dependent). If the bride wears white, red can be considered attention grabbing. If the bride wears red, her culture probably views white as a mourning color. Black can be seen as an objection to the wedding and mourning - very regional.   Something conservative enough for church weddings. Knee length, covers shoulders? Shoulder covering can be fixed with a cardigan.   Something light for a hot outdoor wedding.   In my area, most weddings are cocktail or semi formal aka short dresses are fine. Formal would imply floor length gown, so if the store has a good one, that you like, and you think someone seems more likely to go full formal, that might be a good call.   If you have seasons, then one for each season. Think about the weather in your general area. How cold or hot does it get?
text:> not red  Christ, yes. One of my old college buddies who I haven't been close to in like a decade wore a bright red dress to my wedding. The photographer took a million photos of her, to the exclusion of older family members I'd have rather had photos of. Part of that's on the photographer, of course, but it wouldn't have happened if she hadn't worn BRIGHT RED.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:What is your "White Whale" fashion product that apparently doesn't exist?	labels:I have a leather backpack that seems to fit exactly what you’re describing: real leather (black), professional rectangular design, real backpack straps (ergonomic), AND has a pocket on the strap for my metrocard. The strap pocket doesn’t fit my phone, but I put my phone in a hidden anti-theft back pocket located behind my waist so I can easily access it without having to take off the backpack. I can even connect a powerbank to it to charge my phone. It’s pretty nifty! I got it on Amazon, the brand is Bopai (search “Bopai genuine leather backpack” because they also have synthetic/microfiber leather designs).

text:Also: the lesser known brand today might be the legendary brand of tomorrow.	labels:That’s a very good point!	episode_done:True
text:How would you describe the quality of self-knit/self-made clothes vs. store bought?	labels:I sewed myself a couple of shift dresses more than a decade ago that are pretty much like new. I will say that making your own clothing is time and money consuming. A lot of people think it’ll be cost saving, but it does end up being more expensive if you’re using quality materials.	episode_done:True

And I totally get what you mean by having to satisfy your families opinions.	episode_done:True

text:What is something you've heard as fashion advice that isn't worth following?	labels:Not a specific piece of advice but I think most fashion advice should come with the disclaimer: "advice is intended to make you look taller, skinnier, and more hourglass; does not take comfort into consideration".   If that's not how you actually want to look end up looking, you should disregard most of them.	episode_done:True
text:MFA Wearing Big Coats	labels:Is it even possible to look good when it's -20ºC outside?
text:Yes, but it'll cost you. The less expensive wool coats have wool that's not particularly thick or warm. For most people it's not enough below 0ºC or so. Generally, as you increase in retail price you get warmer fabric. I have a wool/cashmere blend coat that keeps me warm down to about -12ºC. But it would cost 3000 USD today.   If you want to wear a more affordable wool coat when it's -20ºC, you'll have to layer. Down vests under wool coats is a look that's been popular the past couple of years. You could also get a down-lined wool coat. But the only brand I know of that does that is [Norwegian Wool](https://norwegian-wool.com/collections/three-quarter-length-coats/products/grey-herringbone-34length), and then we have the price issue again.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Does anyone else hate literally everything they put on?	labels:Sometimes I go on YouTube and find someone who have a similar body type and see what kind of things they wear. Could the problem be that the items you are wearing doesn’t suit your frame? I think that’s the most common reason why something doesn’t look good on someone. Have you tried experimenting with different items?   On a side note,  for me personally, when I start hating everything I wear, I tend to go back to basics. Basic tshirts, jeans or skirts, and neutral colors. Then I spruce it up with accessories like jewelry, bags, or hats and go from there. Its a lot easier to match when there’s a clean base to start with.
text:I honestly rarely see people with the same body type as me. I’m quite slim but I’ve got MASSIVE shoulders, so things that look pretty and delicate on someone else just look wrong on me. Like I said I’ve done the Kibbe system so I know what is supposed to suit me, it just doesnt translate well on me.   I think I’ll try the basics thing though, thank you.	labels:I've got the same body type.

text:Are our ideas about what looks “dated” on either ourselves or others affected by or correlated with our age?	labels:Yes, I do think our age definitely affects what looks dated to our eye.   I’m noticing that some younger men are wearing some strange iterations of 80’s color-blocked track suits that to me look very Golden Girls. Also, I’ve seen shirt and shorts sets on rappers made out of wild print fabrics exactly like the ones I made for my toddler 25 years ago.  I’m older, so I’ve seen a lot of trends come and go. We are now at the point where they are starting to repeat and are designated as “Vintage”.  I have cultivated my personal style over many years (boho/western), and have seen it done well by Ralph Lauren and most recently Christian Dior in 2018(?) and enjoy the idea of wearing the beautiful things I’ve collected until the end of my life.
text:Do you have a Pinterest or album of wearable boho western style? I speaks to me but imy having difficulty translating it into daily wear.	labels:Not the comment OP and I don't use pinterest but mostly Instagram for inspo for my boho/western style. Pre-covid my office was pretty business casual but in the arts so I could play around a good amount. I wear a few turquoise/sterling silver rings daily, a lot of heeled booties with western flair (like stitching or buckles), a lot of neutrals with a pop of red, SO MANY BANDANNAS (I have an entire basket of them, and you can tie them so many ways), a few subtle sterling silver and turquoise bolo ties, and some vintage looking pearl snap button ups that i'll wear with a cardigan to modernize them.  EDIT: I forgot to add, I have like 4 beaded leather belts that really add some western flair!	episode_done:True

text:Best of Techwearclothing 2020	labels:As someone who is a fan of techwear for the weekends, most of these fits are cool. Definitely not your typical kind of style.  But some of these are really uninspiring tbh. Black boots with plain black pants with black shirt/jacket? Plain black pants and a hoodie/rain jacket? Black leggings and a raincoat? I'm sorry but that's basically what a lot of people wear when its a little chilly or if it rains in the Fall lol. Yea sure its not as simple as blue jeans and an olive coat but still lol  Feels like the pants really make or break these fits
text:Like 90% of albums on this sub, the outfits try way too hard to look unique, and it’s terrible.  If we wanted weird looks it’s easy enough to just hit up the thrift store down the street to buy a costume.	labels: talk shit post fit	episode_done:True
text:Women who have revamped your entire wardrobe — how did that go? What is your advice for the rest of us?	labels:If you aren't married to the idea of capsules:  Buy seasonally appropriate basics and rent fancier work clothing or special occasion garments from Rent the Runway (or another rental brand). It's a good way to take your time with building a wardrobe you like while trying out trends you may be curious about but hesitant to pull the trigger on. It's worth noting that your wardrobe is never really done. Things get worn out, fall out of favor, stop fitting your lifestyle, or you just stop liking them. I think if you have a solid foundation (jeans, slacks, a few blouses, sweaters, t-shirts, undergarments, a few pairs of black and brown shoes) you can find flexibility with styling beyond that without feeling that you have not enough clothing or a million things and nothing to wear.	episode_done:True

text:How do you think access and privilege affect your taste and sense of style?	labels:Honestly, what is the inherent value of being 'stylish'? Does it really matter? How much of your life do you want to spend purchasing and perfecting your wardrobe?
text:Just to be clear, I don't mean "stylish" as in being on trend, having expensive items, etc. I mean it as in "happy in expressing one's own personal style." Fashion is a hobby of mine so I feel stylish when I put together an outfit that makes me feel happy and myself, and it's something that I do for me.	labels:And you think everyone around you wasn’t doing that because you personally think they look bad, or “*poor*”	episode_done:True

text:All-time favorite cold weather pieces?	labels:I have a few I love. During winter my priorities are warmth and style, but it’s one of those things where it’s like “affordable, warm, stylish - pick two.”  - [La Canadienne boots](https://www.lacanadienneshoes.com/us/boots?gclid=CjwKCAjw_Y_8BRBiEiwA5MCBJh87mssT207of8rev5aeZ1P_kFaMaqB9wMGBIUIBYKWlXXVCH7DXmhoCD2gQAvD_BwE) - Yes, these are expensive. But they are sleek, stylish and waterproof. I got [my booties](https://www.nordstrom.com/s/la-canadienne-sara-waterproof-chelsea-boot-women/5545412?utm_channel=low_nd_seo_shopping&utm_source=google&sp_source=google) on a spring sale for $220 and I regret not buying a back up pair. For actual boots, be warned, they are famously narrow-calved. [Blondo](https://blondo.com/collections/booties) is a cheaper alternative and often has similarly [sleek looks](https://www.nordstrom.com/s/blondo-siena-waterproof-bootie-women/5623136).  - [Overland Hollis Shearling Gloves](https://www.overland.com/products/womens-hollis-shearling-lined-lambskin-leather-gloves-70152?cl=bltn) - I LOVE these gloves because they are shaped like delicate ladies gloves (admittedly slightly less slim) but are not flimsy and cold. LOL at the “cashmere lined” bullshit that feels like a thin papery pleather. Shearling is substantial and plush and it will keep you much warmer than other “ladylike” gloves (but not as warm as say [hulky ski/snow gloves](https://m.shopbop.com/arctic-down-gloves-canada-goose/vp/v=1/1562477539.htm?extid=SE_froogle_SC_usa&currencyCode=USD&ef_id=CjwKCAjw_Y_8BRBiEiwA5MCBJgz0i4HKVr9k1S4NLRkScaueHxJ5gECZPKsDNsYxTEnPYR3Z_C6-xxoCbE4QAvD_BwE%3AG%3As&cvosrc=cse.google.CANAD30182&cvo_campaign=SB_Google_USD&gclid=CjwKCAjw_Y_8BRBiEiwA5MCBJgz0i4HKVr9k1S4NLRkScaueHxJ5gECZPKsDNsYxTEnPYR3Z_C6-xxoCbE4QAvD_BwE)).  - [Sosken Studios](https://soskenstudios.com/collections/coats-jackets) - Winter coats and style are hard to reconcile, but leave it once again to the Canadians! (you thought Sosken with the “O” was Scandinavian brand didn’t you? So did I). My favorite thing about them is that they sell slim/thin/lightweight puffers that are designed to go under their existing stylish coats. I have their [Ghia](https://soskenstudios.com/collections/light-puffers/products/ghia-sand-lightweight-down-jacket) and it’s a godsend for extending my fashionable wool coat wear  - [Soia & Kyo](https://www.soiakyo.com/) - they have their fair share of beautiful fall coats, but their down winter ones also have a pleasing tailored waist. Like Sosken, you can layer their lighter puffers. Some of their wool coats have [puffer built in](https://www.soiakyo.com/us/en/evette-classic-wool-coat-with-quilted-puffer-lining/EVETTE-C.html), which we can all agree is a rare and precious thing. **Note:** Neither Sosken or Soia & Kyo will keep you toasty like a Moncler or Canada Goose type down thing for the arctic, but they are perfect for bridging that gap between “stylish wool car coat” and “Michelin Man Snowsuit” weather.  - [Icebreaker thermals](https://www.icebreaker.com/en-us/womens-baselayers) - I hate spending money on thermals, and [Uniqlo’s Heattech line](https://www.uniqlo.com/us/en/women/heattech) is honestly good enough for almost everything. And then my husband took me ice fishing in Northern Minnesota and I spent the whole time wondering whether merely agreeing to go on the trip or marrying him in general was a terrible life decision but what was definitely not a terrible life decision was picking up some of these. They are the REAL DEAL for cold weather active wear and frequently much less expensive at sporting/outdoor stores, especially if you don’t care about things like color (which, honestly, they are thermals).  - [Wolford Merino Tights](https://www.wolfordshop.com/hosiery/tights/merino-tights/11310.html?nsctrid=v02_us_g_g_263083883451_&gclid=CjwKCAjw_Y_8BRBiEiwA5MCBJr3A0QTZPlipwI6nv57PtVz6mzSGvTjvESFkP05l4PjzKWhBS51NOBoCuPMQAvD_BwE) - like thermals, I hate spending money on tights. I ordered these black ones at $40 a piece from some European online sock store and hated every moment of it. Now it’s 3 years later and I am glad I spent the money. They are warm, slightly translucent so not frumpy like completely opaque tights can be, and unlike smartwool, they do not have the white “Smartwool” logo above the toe line so you can actually wear these with normal pumps in transitional weather. They also pilled less than smartwool. They are the only reason why I can continue to wear dresses and skirts to the office in the winter.  - [Love your melon](https://loveyourmelon.com/) - purveyors of the basic white girl beanie pom hats, or “toques.” What I like about them is that they are thick knit and almost universally flattering. I have a huge head and typically beanies fit me like a condom but this one retains that slightly oversized effortlessly cozy look. Also 100% made in USA and Canada and 50% of their profits are donated to child cancer research. I have the speckled one and I love it.
