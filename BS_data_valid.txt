text:What are your 2021 Fashion / Style Goals?	labels:My realistic goal is to not shop new at all and really limit shopping secondhand. I'm going to *not* shop when bored or stressed (not too hard to do, since I'm not really going out at the moment due to covid, obviously, and online shopping doesn't give me the same boost). I almost set a no-buy for myself, but I know myself well enough to know that if I slip once, I'll consider the whole thing a wash and go crazy. So I'm "allowing" second hand purchases, but I really intend to try and limit even those.   Dream goal is to take sewing lessons and learn how to make my own clothes. I realize I need actual in-person help with this, as I've tried youtube and other online tutorials and I just can't. I need to be able to ask questions and get feedback. So if things get better, I'm looking at this summer finding a class or teacher to start. This has been like a fifteen year goal, though. I am somehow making it happen in 2021!!	episode_done:True

The pandemic has everyone following their own rules, and I think we‚Äôre realizing what we individually gravitate to and prefer when we‚Äôre not trying to cater to society or fit in. Maybe people will rebel against ‚Äúx item is dated, y item is in, z is the hot trend‚Äù and say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt give a s**t what you think, and I‚Äôll wear what I like.‚Äù Maybe there will be greater acceptance of individual personal styles that may not have a lot in common with what‚Äôs in style right now.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 07, 2020	labels:Need shoe help. Feeling lost.  I'm looking for a comfortable everyday shoe that I can be a little rough on. Something I can wear in the garage and an occasional hike, but one that also looks good.   I'm in my 30s and have been mostly what we call business casual in California engineering, but what most people might call just casual. I'd like to move slightly to a more professional look. For pants,  I normally wear dark jeans, khakis that are a little darker ([Lululemon Commission Artifact](https://shop.lululemon.com/p/men-pants/Commission-Pant-Classic-Warpstreme-32/_/prod9510026?color=29283)), and occasionally green chinos. It would be nice to get some versatile shoes.  Currently considering the following:  [Red Wing Work Chukka in Briar](https://www.redwingshoes.com/heritage/mens/chukka/Work-Chukka-03141.html)  [Wolverine 1000 in brown](https://www.wolverine.com/US/en/original-1000-mile-boot/17967M.html?dwvar_17967M_color=W05301)  [Danner Jag low](https://www.danner.com/men/lifestyle/jag-low-brown-summer-wheat.html)  [Danner Jag not low](https://www.danner.com/men/lifestyle/jag-barley.html)  And of course, the oft mentioned CDB Beeswax  I like the Jag Low, but I'm afraid it's too casual and I'll still look like I'm not trying. I realize my answer might be more than one shoe. I'm not a huge fan of the CDB, but it's suggested so often here that I might just get it anyway.  I've spent the last few weeks looking through the sub, reading the guides and searching for answers. It's been great, but I'm a little hung up on shoes. I'm somewhat of a newbie to the men's fashion world.  My current daily shoes are Merrell Adventure Moab, which I like, but they're getting torn up and the more I look at them, the more they look like clown shoes. I feel a little head spinny trying to nail down which shoe to buy. I'm about to just pull the trigger on one and see how I like it for a week, but I thought I'd check here first. My budget is flexible.
text:I don't really have a comment on style of boots but just an anecdote about Red Wings. I own 2 pairs now and I love them both. My older pair has been resoled twice now (owned for about 5 years) and although looking a little rough is still going strong.   I actually also own some CBD's and I absolutely hate them. Even after being well broken in they still hurt like hell after being on my feet in them for a while. So if you don't absolutely adore how they look I would just pass on the CBD altogether.	labels:Good to know. CDBs don't look comfortable and I'm definitely not in love with them.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 29, 2020	labels:Hi, so a couple years ago I bought a super cheap black jacket in a Forever 21 sale. I actually really like the design of the jacket but I never really wore it more than once because it pills on an absolutely ridiculous level.   I'm wondering now if anyone here has any recommendations for a jacket that looks as close to this as possible but higher quality. I really like a lot of details of the jacket: the buttons, the little ringlet on the zipper on the arm, the "thickness" the fit, etc. I just can't deal with the pilling lol. Ideally something under $200 would also be nice.  Any suggestions? Here's an old pic of me in it: https://imgur.com/MOIpLz2

Just below the knee is the perfect length for that drama, I‚Äôd say halfway down the shins is the maximum length.   If you‚Äôre short, the BDE from wearing a longer coat overwhelms any impressions of making you look shorter, if those are even a real thing.

text:Among the rights we've got is a right to police our own, and tell someone that some politician's Illustrator-traced photo on a cheap, mass-produced T-shirt with an empty, banal slogan underneath does not a potent feminist statement make.  Feminism's goal was never to make women and their opinions and actions beyond reproach.  It is feminist for a woman to be able to do what they want to do within the boundaries of law and common decency. It is also feminist for a woman to look at the performance and think that they should make better choices with regards to both feminism and consumerism, lol.	labels:"Police your own"?  I fail to see how you have a right to police OP's request; and an anonymous downvote doesn't accomplish that.    It's interesting that you automatically equate OP's request with "some politician's Illustrator-traced photo on a cheap, mass-produced T-shirt with an empty, banal slogan".  Many of the items suggested on this sub are cheap and mass produced and I dont see all this faux concern on those posts.  If you're concerned about *policing* that so she doesn't buy that t shirt, her post opens the floor for you to make a different suggestion.	episode_done:True

I do have a rather casual toned white dress shirt it still looks a bit formally though compared to that classic leather jacket white t-shirt look.  It's going to be a bit cold.
text:If it's cold go with a long sleeve, but make sure it's actually a button down and not a business shirt.	labels:Thanks for the reply. What I have looking st the receipt.

Granted I would never wear this with a suit, but I do not think there is anything wrong with rocking these with chinos and a button down.  You can even add a blazer if you need to be a bit more formal.
text:I snagged some Italian made pair a few years ago for a significant amount off the actual retail (lol per this thread I guess because they're "dress sneakers"), I don't recall the brand name off hand and since I haven't gone into the office ever again I don't really wear them anymore, but the leather feels so super comfortable and nice. They're tan with the per this thread, hated white sole. But it's a normal sneaker sole not that chunky one people keep posting.  \*shrug* I like them and they pair well with some outfits. Not as versatile as a regular sneaker, but nice to have a different flavor when you want something different.	labels:Totally agree. I work in a hospital and get tons of steps in some days.

If I weren‚Äôt chunky from having 3 babies and I wouldn‚Äôt look like mutton posing as a lamb, I would still rock that shit. I‚Äôve been feeling a lot of crop top envy ever since they came back.	labels:Your phrasing cracked me up.  You should check out longer crops and the crops at Torrid. I like crops too but have gained weight in my 30s (hypothyroidism sucks). You can find some at a great length that would only show your stomach if you reached your arms up and honestly, you have nothing to be ashamed of. I didn't fit Torrid clothes before but they and American Eagle/Aerie have made me realize that a ton of super cute stuff is still wearable. I just had to get used to dressing a bit of a different shape. The models look amazing and it made me realize I can too. I'm almost more confident now than I was as a teen/early 20s. You're amazing for having had three babies and so is your body, even if it's not your goal body right now. You can still rock that shit man.	episode_done:True

The tailoring is impeccable; I cannot find a flaw.  [Acne Studios](https://www.acnestudios.com/uk/en/woman/new-arrivals/) but a bit more curated, less of their streetwear style and more of the classic stuff.  [Loewe](https://www.loewe.com/usa/en/women/womenswear/kaleidoscope-jacquard-dress/S540Y09X34-9990.html) for everything leather, but I'm especially curious after spotting some of their knitwear on Instagram stories.

But only when it's hot! ;)  [Dries Van Noten](https://www.instagram.com/driesvannoten/?hl=en) everything. Textures and colors galore. My entire shoe wardrobe. Particularly those block heels, but whole spectrum, work and weekend really.  [Peter Do](https://peterdo.net/products/black-logo-asymmetrical-dress) is so fresh.

text:ModCloth Returns to ‚ÄúIndependent‚Äù Ownership	labels:My problem with Modcloth is that every time I liked an item I look and it'd be made of polyester (looking at you, Pam Breezely top!).  Polyester makes me sweat like crazy, and I've been trying to switch my clothes all to more natural fibers where possible.  Looking at their catalogue today I'm seeing a lot of Rayon and Viscose, which is better, but there's not a lot that catches my fancy.  I also miss the indie designers! I hate how if you're not into whatever is considered mainstream fashion for that season that it's really difficult to find items that are both accessible and stylistically different than anything else on the rack. For me, Modcloth used to fit that gap, especially since most (all?) of their styles extended into plus sizes.
text:Pam Breezly tops are total trash and entirely why I wonder what ‚Äúquality‚Äù items people were getting from there. I‚Äôm guessing it was established smaller brands that had better quality.	labels:The cut of it looks like a nice, comfortable top that you can wear without any effort.   When you actually get one, though, the fabric clings to you because of the polyester and I had to wear a cami under it or it was obscene bc it shows ever little curve in the lace of my bras.

text:I need help with getting rid of clothes	labels:Hi! As a stylist I get this question ALOT. For starters don't get rid of too much before buying replacements. What ends up happening is we get rid of everything without establishing what pieces we actually need.   Start with establishing your personal style. What do your want your closet/style to be? What do you want to look like on the day to day?   Next, set aside pieces that don't fit you well. If there is potential to have the piece tailored then get that done. Key here is to just set these pieces aside but dont get rid of them yet until you find a replacement just in case you HAVE to wear it again.   Lastly is shopping! Now that you have a moodboard and list of things you need you can shop to fin in the gaps and more importantly you can shop with intention!   &#x200B;  I hope that wasn't too much and was helpful haha. I'm always happy to help.

I think that creativity aspect keeps me going and not spending as much. Sort of like baking from scratch, rather than the box lol.

text:If you could only have one overcoat, what would it be?	labels:I would have to give top spot to my favourite coat, even though I never get to wear it and it mostly lives in the corner of my wardrobe untouched. A calf-length faux fur number in brown shag. Nothing better than wearing it with some absurdly tight pants, chelsea boots, and some kind of awful v-neck shirt on the days when I can get away with it. It's hard to pull off the 'aging rocker' look when you're under 30 but damn it, I try.  That said, my typical go-to has been a brown leather bomber I thrifted for like 20 bucks 5 years ago. I bought it when I was fat so now it's lose enough to layer up sweaters on cold Canadian winter days, it's a warm brown so it looks cheerful and not grey-bleak-sad like the landscape around me, and a homeless guy once told me it was 'a total classic.' The only downside is because it's a bomber it leaves my legs exposed and I get cold knees, but that just depends what fabric your trousers are made of and you can work around it. Throw on some long underwear and some wool slacks and you're good to go.	episode_done:True

text:Does anyone have a "uniform"?	labels:I often buy multiples of items I love. I bought several of the same cardigan after I realized that I wore it more than any other sweater I owned. It's great!  Another thing I do is, when I see an item I like, I mentally run through my closet and see if it will mesh with what I already own. If it works, I get it. If I'd have to buy several new items to make it work, I don't. For this reason, I don't own many t-shirts, but I do own lots of sweaters and dresses.
text:I have to be able to create at least 3 different outfits from what is already in my closet before I buy a new piece.  And if I'm looking at a fun floral pair of pants, for example, I won't consider it if I can only wear it with 3 different white t-shirts.  There has to be some variety in the pairings.   I also have to know where I would wear it.  Right now, my job is very casual (it's a fitness related field), so if I see a dress or skirt, I usually have to pass because I don't have anywhere to wear it except the grocery store.   These parameters have stopped me from buying mindlessly, but it also has created a pretty cohesive closet.  It also helps that I stick to a handful of colors and silhouettes.	labels:Yes, this is great! I should apply this same rule. Sadly, I wear so many dresses that I can just wear them every day. I'm out of control with options for those! Haha!   I'm glad most of my stuff is pretty office friendly, for sure.	episode_done:True
text:How much was your most expensive fashion item and when or how often do you wear it?	labels:Not counting formalwear, definitely coats. I pretty much live in wool overcoats from October to April. I've thrifted quite a few and bought others on sale, but I find things originally priced in the $250-$450 range are usually a decent bet. Last year I stumbled into a fantastic Aritzia sale and picked up a black-and-white houndstooth coat and a bright orange wrap coat for under $200 each‚Äîit was a splurge-y day, but I'll wear them both for many years. I'm hoping to find options in another bright colour (maybe apple green, sky blue or light purple) and dark red this year.  I would also pay this much for leather outerwear, trousers, bags or boots‚Äîbut these are not things I purchase often. I am vaguely considering some black or burgundy leather straight-leg trousers this season, but with COVID I'm not sure sure there are enough opportunities to wear them.

text:How do you style your existing wardrobe in a way that doesn‚Äôt get boring?	labels:If you don't wear a lot of the clothes you own, then I think it's a good thing to sell them on the second hand market, and use the money you earn to buy a few new pieces. There is nothing wrong with wanting new things.  Even when basics are basics, they are not the same. The cut, sleeve length, collar shape can be very different. Color combinations can also change a look a lot.  I move around pretty often, so I keep a small wardrobe of fewer than 50 items (not including tees/leggings and other basics). If I figure out I won't wear a shirt or jacket in the foreseeable future, I sell them on the second hand market. I update a few jackets/shirts per year.  It's also good to look at what new styles are out there, and create outfits with the clothes you have. So, expose yourself to fashion magazines, online media, and let your creative juices fly.
text:You‚Äôre absolutely right‚Äîrealistically I‚Äôm probably never going to wear a chunk of my wardrobe.

Is there a specific site you like best for reselling items you know you don‚Äôt need?	labels:I resell on Poshmark. It's just easier compared to Ebay, because they give you a label to print out. You might get less $$ back, but it has a return policy that is better than Ebay for sellers.   How to make easy sales, that takes a little learning process. Brand recognition matters a lot. A Gap tee is gonna be more recognized and easier to sell than a tee from some unknown boutique brand. Also check recently sold listings to see how much your item is going for currently. I suggest you check r/poshmark or r/ebay to get started.	episode_done:True

text:What's your fashion tragedy?	labels:Those boots are epic, for the record.  I spilled about 100 mL of trifluoroacetic acid on myself at work a couple years back.  Had to strip down to my undies in lab, and rush down the hall barely covered in a clean lab coat, soaking wet from the lab safety shower to the locker room so i could finish showering in privacy.  ANYWAY, the trousers i was wearing weren't special, except that i do pay full price for my work trousers since they are a major line of defense between me and things like acid or base.  When i took them off, i threw them into the sink with my shirt and had the water running over them.  When i got back from the shower and looked in the sink, sure enough, the trousers and shirt were basically swiss cheese.  Could have been a ton worse though - the wound on my leg was only about 1" x 4", and i honestly had no other skin damage besides that one spot.  My lab coat, trousers, and shirt protected me almost everywhere.	episode_done:True

text:What are your predictions for 2021 suit style?	labels:I would say that suits in general have been on the downtrend among white-collar types; a lot of jobs just don‚Äôt demand it anymore. I think the pandemic and bankruptcies you mentioned may push that trend further, but it was already on its way.  As far a changes in the style of common suits: I think super wide/skinny lapels are definitely on their way out (if they‚Äôre not already there), looser fits may make a comeback, and I feel that somewhat bolder colors might be a bit more popular.   As for the more fashion-forward: I feel like I‚Äôve been seeing more belted suits, skirt suits/skirts + blazers (on men; @ Harry Styles), and asymmetric details. Obviously that‚Äôs getting into the world of fashion show stuff, so it doesn‚Äôt influence most of us that much, but it‚Äôs worth talking about.
text:> I think the pandemic and bankruptcies you mentioned may push that trend further, but it was already on its way.  I actually wonder if the opposite will happen.

I walked into my closet to pick one out for the day and realized that majority of the ones in there were deformed, torn, or years old. For something that I wear everyday, I wanted to invest in some quality pieces that would not only look good but hold up over time. Once I get into something, I dive way too deep which led me to consume any content available about t-shirts. The goal was to learn what makes a t-shirt great and what would suit me the best. A few days filled with reading Reddit posts and blogs and nearly $600 later, I received the top few brand that were mentioned frequently. I put them all through their paces and made sure I tested them as thoroughly as I could to find the best t-shirt available right now.  &#x200B;  My look for three things in a perfect t-shirt: the fits, the feel, and the construction. My definition of a good fit is one that drapes well, hugs the arms and is fitted in the chest but leaves some room in the stomach for after a meal. For the feel, I'm looking for something that is soft to the touch and smooth. In terms of quality, I like a heavier t-shirt that has a solid collar that doesn't deform and doesn't shrink when it's washed.  &#x200B;  For reference: these are all a small or medium. I went off the measurements on the size charts.  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10‚Äù, 175 lbs.  # Uniqlo:  Lets start with the famous the Uniqlo Supima Cotton Crewneck T-Shirt. I've read high praises for this tee on various subs and decided to give it a shot after seeing everyone swear by them. The shirt is 100% Supima cotton which is just a brand of cotton that is grown in California, Texas, New Mexico or Arizona. It is supposedly amongst the top 1% of cotton grown in the world. Extra long fibers that give it more strength, softness and color retention compared to normal cotton. Theres no weight that is advertised but the fabric feels thin in comparison to the others on this list.  The fit is in between a slim fit and a regular fit. It hugs the arms well, and leaves room in the stomach but shrinks a bit after a wash. I opted for a small and it fits well. The neck opening is on the smaller end and wears higher than the rest which may be a plus depending on your preference. I got a small and it fit like I'd expect it to.  For a $15 the t-shirt is decent at best. The quality isn't there and this shirt doesn't hold up after a few washes. I noticed a little bit of shrinkage after a wash and it lost some of it's initial softness. It compared to a normal J.Crew t-shirt after the wash. In the review section on Uniqlo's website, customers have said the quality on these used to be very good but has gone down in recent months when the production factory shifted from Cambodia to Vietnam. They say the fabric feels thinner, fits worse and doesn't hold up as well.  The collar feels pretty weak and although its fine now, I suspect it will develop a bacon neck in a few more washes.  Overall for $15 it's still a solid tee for anyone on a budget but considering companies like Bella and Canvas make similar quality t-shirts for $4, I'd rather spend my money there and save up for something a bit higher end.  # Cuts Clothing:  Next up we have the Cuts Clothing Split Hem Crewneck tee. Just a quick heads up, their marketing is insanely persistent so be prepared for them to take over all your Youtube, Facebook and Instagram ads as soon as you visit their website. I decided to go with it just to see what the hype was all about. Immediately out of the box the t-shirt was insanely soft and bouncy. It's made of Cuts own fabric called Pyca which is a blend of Cotton, Spandex and Polyester. The fabric has four way stretch for comfort and doesn't wrinkle easily. The fabric feels very 'performance' oriented in a synthetic way even though it's made to wear casually. That isn't a bad thing but just something to note compared to the 100% cotton options on this list.  I opted for a medium as the fit is on the slimmer end. The tee sits a bit long and bunches up near my waist and makes my legs look very short when I wear these with cuffed jeans. I do prefer to wear these with joggers or black jeans to make them look more streamlined.  They have a "build your own" concept where you choose between three necks: a crewneck, a v-neck, or a henley, and three bottoms: an elongated curve, a split hem, and a classic curve. They all run slightly long which could be ideal for streetwear styles. The color pallet is always on point because they stick close to neutrals tones while adding new shades every season. This is the Arctic Haze color which was a light green available a few seasons ago.  The fabric is thin and breathable but does not feel cheap. The collar is very thin so it eliminates the chances of deforming after a few washes. I haven't experienced any shrinkage at all even after multiple washes.  At $48 we can see where their marketing budget comes from but I'm impressed by the buttery fabric, the stretch, how low maintenance it is, and the fit. I probably wouldn't buy another pair due to the length and the price. If the length suits your body then this might not be a bad option but there are higher quality shirts out there for cheaper.
text:# Part 2:  # EVERLANE:  Up next lets talk about the Everlane Premium Weight Crew in a size small. Although it is marked as a slim fit, this is the boxiest out of all the t-shirts here leaving plenty of room in the sleeves and through the body. At 6.2 ounces, I love the weight of this T-shirt but it was the most basic feeling of the batch. Reminded me of a fresh Gildan shirt from high school but with more weight. It was scratchy initially but has softened slightly after about a year of washes and wears. The neck has held up pretty well and I love the color of this shirt. Coming in at $30, I would say this isn't worth it in my opinion but if you like boxier fits and a wide variety of colors to choose from, this might be the way to go. I've seen it under $20 on their Pick Your Price section.  # Robert Barakett:  Don't worry, I hadn't heard of the brand either but I was introduced to them when my girlfriend snagged me a white tee from Nordstrom's Anniversary sale last year from them. I went back shortly after and bought the dark grey for myself and then picked up the navy one in this year's sale. The Canadian company calls it the Barakett T but it's also known as the Georgia Crew at discount retailers. It's made from 100% ultra-fine US grown cotton and is finished with a heavy enzyme wash. Robert Barakett claims this helps give it a worn and broken in feel and gives the fabric a slight sheen, both of which I can attest to. The material is cool to the touch and very smooth. I've worn them with joggers and under a sports coat and work well in any situation. These have been a part of my rotation for about a year now and I've experienced no loss of color.  All mine are a size small. They fit a bit large initially but they shrank a good amount on the first wash so keep that in mind when sizing. The shirt's length was perfect when new but is slightly short for me after the shrinkage. The arms and chest region came in nicely and were perfect for me after the wash.  The collar shows no sign of wear even after wearing these regularly for a year. The split hem is a nice feature that prevents any pulling for more athletic legged people.  They are $60 on their website but don't pay that much for this tee. Nordstrom's Anniversary sale brings it down to $38 for all the staple colors and I've seen quirky colors for as low as $20 on Nordstrom Rack. Just be sure you look for the "Georgia" tee on the discount sites. At that price, these are some of the best bang-for-your-buck and are worth stocking up on.  # 3Sixteen:  I've only known 3Sixteen to specialize in denim so I was a little hesitant adding them to this list. However, there seems to be a cult like following for their t-shirts and I had to see what it was all about. This is their Pima T-shirt. The regular crewneck was sold out so I had to opt for the pocket t-shirt but the material and fit are the exact same. Right off the bat, these were super soft to the touch. Almost a viscose like softness to them but they're 100% American grown Pima cotton. The fabrics is roughly 160gsm so it feels substantial in the best way. The collars are very sturdy due to it's triple stitched collar.  After looking at the size chart, I opted for a medium. The fit was okay and was easily the biggest drawback about this T-shirt. The sleeves didn't hug my arms and it was very boxy around the torso area. This might just be my fault and a small could fit how I like. I'll have to give it a shot and edit this once I get results.  The tees are made in the USA so they come at a premium. They're only available in packs of two which I don't really like but a lot of higher end t-shirt brands do this. Colors are limited to black and white in the Pima shirts as of me making this post. 3Sixteen also offer a henley, long sleeve and a heavyweight shirt but they aren't made of the pima fabric so it wont be as soft. They come in at $95 for a pack of two or $47.50 a piece. They're really high quality so the price is justified but they aren't my favorite because of the fit (again, could just be my bad).  # Lady White Company  LWC was literally started on this one t-shirt so my expectations were high. I was super excited to get this shirt in because I was intrigued by the "no side seams". This model is called the "Our T-Shirt". It's made of 100% cotton grown in North Carolina and the t-shirt is cut, sewn, and knitted in Los Angeles.  The construction on this tee was flawless. the double needle stitch sits perfectly on the collar and lines up exactly with the shoulder seam. The fit was relaxed and boxy so I'm glad I got a small to get the fit I look for.  The main feature about this tee is the lack of seams on the side. They claim it helps achieve a more natural drape and allows the T-shirt to conform better to the body. LWC do this by using circular knitting machines that allow the torso area to be sewn as a tube instead of two separate pieces. It's super unique and is something I found really cool. The fabric itself is 6 ounces so it has a very good weight. I was disappointed when I unboxed it and the fabric was very rough. The fabric didn't have that soft brushed like finish that I look for personally. It felt like a fresh vintage tee from the mid 1900s which isn't a bad thing, just something I don't prefer. The knit is dense and sturdy. I would compare this tee to raw denim. It's not the most comfortable and soft out of the bag but you can feel it's heft and sense of quality. It's supposed to break in and get softer the more and more it's worn so I'll have to see what it's like a year from now.  Grey, navy, black and white come in a 2-pack for $99. If you want a different color, you'll be looking at $55 for a single one.  The construction and fit were great and checked my boxes but overall the tshirt was meh because of the feel. I'll probably get heat for this since this t-shirt is supposed to be the holy grail but I just wasn't that impressed, personally. Maybe I just don't get it or I just haven't worn it enough but I don't think I would run out and get another one.  # ASKET  Lastly we have Asket. Asket is a Swedish company started in 2015 with a pursuit to create the best basics and is a minimalist favorite. I've heard a lot about this company and have always wanted to try them out so I went with their regular T-shirt. Asket uses 100% Egyptian cotton and has a weight of 180gsm.  The fabric was soft to the touch, but second to Cuts. It offers enough structure for it to feel well made but flows enough to drapes over the body really well. The fit was probably my favorite out of all the ones I'm reviewing today. Asket offers 15 different sizes for their T-shirts. Ranging from XS to XL and then breaking down further into short, regular and long. It lets everyone find their ideal fit which seems like common sense but is rare for some reason. The t-shirts and dyed, sewn and assembled all in Portugal and the craftsmanship shows. There were no stray threads on either of the t-shirts and everything was put together flawlessly. The collar is ribbed and feels very sturdy. After a few washes I can confirm it holds up just as well as it did when it was brand new.  The fit is what shined through the most. This was snug in all the right places but left just enough room in the stomach area without look sloppy. You still get that streamlined silhouette and tons of versatility with this t-shirt. I opted for a size small and it fit exactly how I expected it too. I could probably also get away with a medium but I'm not sure if it would hug the chest and arms as well.  At $45 this is pricey but worth it in my opinion. Asket offers a great product and their customer service is always willing to help. It offers a simple, well made, crisp t-shirt in a ton of different colors. Overall I was very impressed and it definitely lived up to my expectation.  # TLDR/Overall Rank (value + fit + feel + quality):  1. Asket 2. Robert Barakett 3. Cuts Clothing 4. 3Sixteen (3rd and 4th were a toss up) 5. Lady White Co 6. Uniqlo 7. Everlane  Obviously, this is just my personal opinion based off what I look for. Your order could be the complete opposite and that's okay. Any of these is solid pick (besides Everlane lol).

text:advice on how to stop buying clothes I don't need?	labels:It might be worthwhile to give yourself a no buy period. Maybe start with a month and use it to identify when and why you are triggered to buy yourself clothes. Write down all the things you want to buy and re-evaluate at the end of the month.   I find a waiting period and a list really helps me a lot! I erase all the things I realize I don't want, which also feel cathartic. It's also good to evaluate how you feel when purchasing, when waiting for the item to arrive if purchased online, when you receive the item, and then like an hour after you receive the item. As I've reduced my purchasing, I've identified that I don't like having the item as much as I like purchasing and waiting (even for the things I've waited weeks to purchase), so I try to remember that when I do make a purchase.

text:What fashion trend/s have you been obsessed with lately?	labels:Yeah corduroy! I've liked it for awhile but only have a few pieces. My fav recent purchases within the last 6 months include a corduroy long sleeve button shirt, striped long sleeve button shirt, gingham dress, some tops with slight puffs and relaxed loose jeans. I bought the shirts to use as a light jacket here in summer as the sun is really strong lol and I don't want to get random and uneven tans. I mainly have basic oldddd tees so wanted to get something more pretty haha. I like the subtle puff thing but sometimes it just doesn't look nice for me but I'm waiting on something I ordered and can't wait to try it. Also kinda like lettuce trimming on shirts. Bought some long sleeve rib shirts with lettuce trims. Quite cute but now that I have them I think they'll be too stretched out after quite a few wears.  I also bought air maxes, so comfy! I didnt know they'd be something I like.   Nearly all of these I purchased pre owned too which I like haha except the lettuce tee and puff shirt weren't purchased used unfortunately.	episode_done:True

text:Does anyone have a "uniform"?	labels:I wouldn‚Äôt call it a uniform per se, but I think I‚Äôm a very ‚Äúformulaic‚Äù dresser when it comes to everyday workwear and casual wear.   For a work day, it‚Äôs always black loafers + black pants + simple top, whether it be a sweater or blouse. I work in a very conservative industry but my office is usually pretty casual, so I find this formula is best for most days and I can throw on a blazer or heels I keep in my office if needed. I would hate to be in a situation where I have to run to a meeting short notice, which happens more often than I‚Äôd like to admit, and look like a sore thumb in terms of casualness compared to the other women in the room, who are usually a lot older and more advanced in their careers than I am. I pretty much only wear the same jewelry everyday for work too.   For going out and weekends, it‚Äôs usually fun shoes + jeans + nice top + a fun element, either a statement bracelet or statement earrings.   I think my style can get a bit predictable in that I own the same pair of black pants 4 times and 3 pairs of very similar loafers, but I have fun items like cheetah ankle boots I‚Äôm obsessed with to make it fun, but can also get away with for work. I echo previous comments about fussing over tops though with this formula, and the idiocy of men copying Zuckerberg or Jobs with the uniforms... don‚Äôt they realize that they don‚Äôt/didn‚Äôt look particularly good??	episode_done:True

text:What is your ideal first date outfit?	labels:Warm weather: I love to wear a colorful sundress with a nude short heel, and focus more on my accessories (just earrings and a shawl). If it's more casual, I like rompers and switch the heels for nice flats. I LOVE rompers because I can get the silhouette of a little dress/skirt but can remain more active. One of my favorite early dates with my boyfriend was going to the arcade in the summer, and the romper outfit was perfect for that.   Cold weather: I've been big on corduroy the last couple years, I have a couple of cute corduroy dresses I love to style with chunky sweaters and warm tights. If it's really cold, I switch to corduroy pants with a simple fluffy turtleneck. I have a pair of Timberlands, the mono black ones with the velvet cuff and velvet laces, and they look a little nicer but are still practical in the snow.   I also have pretty long hair, and that's my favorite accessory honestly- I think your hairstyle can really set the mood for a date. This spring/summer I was really big on a single braid, pinned to the side, with a ribbon or scarf braided in with the hair. It was super easy to do but it really dresses up a more casual fit. Also hair forks!! I've been having a lot of fun playing with those for an updo that looks really nice, but is so simple and easy.

These only retailed for around $200-300 each but they‚Äôre some of my favorite pieces in my collection, I haven‚Äôt found anything super high-end.

I concluded that I dress for a particular feeling. So if the piece ‚Äúfeeds‚Äù the feeling...it just feels good to let go.

I just think that Arctic Monkeys and the Black Keys releasing slow jazzy stuff back to back changed the rock landscape in a way that I personally really, really dislike hahaha.   Man, listening to El Camino, Brothers, Attack and Release, or Magic Potion brings me right back to my teenage years.

Even though I'm home all by myself and the only person who ever sees me is the Amazon delivery guy who I wait for by my window because *oh my god, I need human contact,* I'm still putting on a full face of makeup, doing my hair, and wearing spanx, a push-up bra, a sheath dress that fits like a second skin, 4" heels, and perfume.  I'm doing it for *me*, you know, because feeling sexy while I'm all by myself is much more important than being comfortable. Sure, it's easier to get coffee and cheeto stains out of my bathrobe than a 100% wool dress, but cheetos aren't sexy either.   For Christmas, Fashion Santa is going to bring me a brand new dress for every zoom event I have scheduled in 2021, because I would just die if people saw me wearing the same outfit week after week, which is definitely the kind of thing people are thinking about these days.

text:How has your style changed as you‚Äôve gotten older?	labels:When I was younger, I really wanted my clothes to speak for me - I felt the need for them to convince others that I was "edgy."  I drummed in a metal band in my late teens/early 20s (this was in the early aughts), and during that time I wore lots of low rise bootcut jeans and was super into thrifting vintage tops and ironic graphic tees.  I wore chunky shoes and always had black nail polish, although I didn't really wear makeup.  My clothes and my involvement in the music scene were how I communicated to others that I was "hardcore," and in hindsight, it was really important to me that others perceived me that way.  Now, at 33, I have almost an aversion to dressing alt in any way?  I wear whatever I want at this point, and it tends toward the femme side of things.  I feel like I have a deep self-knowledge at this point that I am indeed badass, and I don't need my clothes or others' perceptions to tell me that about myself.  It took me a decade of forging that through some really wild experiences, though.  It became less about "I'm hardcore because I wear X, Y, Z or listen to X, Y, Z music" and more "I know I'm hardcore because I've epically handled X, Y, Z experience with grace and tenacity, so I don't really care how other people perceive me."  It frees me up to wear a frilly silk Sezane blouse if I feel like it that day.	episode_done:True

text:Can you have a clothing style without actually wearing that certain style much?	labels:This isn‚Äôt a direct answer to your question, but I‚Äôve found I have a ‚Äòhopeful‚Äô sense of style and a ‚Äòrealistic‚Äô sense of style.  Hopeful-me will think about buying a teal floral wrap dress because it‚Äôs gorgeous. Realistic-me knows it will sit in my closet untouched for 3 years because I don‚Äôt wear teal!   I‚Äôve learned to differentiate between the two while I shop, at least. If I was a celebrity suddenly, maybe I would lean towards hopeful-me‚Äôs style, but for now I am normal and realistic!
text:Yes this! I call it ‚Äúideal style‚Äù and ‚Äúreal style‚Äù. My ‚Äúideal style‚Äù involves a lot of flowy, Christy Dawn-style dresses. My actual, ‚Äúreal style‚Äù is way more simple - in my free time I wear a lot of plain t-shirts, sweaters, and jeans/shorts. I‚Äôve bought a couple of absolutely lovely dresses over the years that I never wear, but will reach for my favorite Everlane t-shirts and comfy sweaters over and over again.	labels:I call it my "aspirational" me.

text:Do you feel constrained fashion-wise by not wanting to (or being able to) wear heels?	labels:I love the look of heels. In my twenties I bought a ton. Even designer heels. If you wear them where I live, you get weird looks. Women just do not wear heels here. Plus, winters are harsh and you really can't wear them during the winter. So here I am, with a collection of Louboutins and Valentino that sit in boxes in my closet.   To answer the question, I feel constrained by the fashion of the city I live in. Heels are excluded from the norm. If I dressed up like fashion bloggers, I would get stared at. It would be non stop, "what are you so dressed up for."   I do not have feet issues preventing me from wearing them. Im not very good in heels from lack of practice. I have some rockstud kitten heels that I can walk in fine. Something like a pigalle makes me unsteady.

text:Lol..they‚Äôre probably talking about the items that are mainly polyester or similar and give these clothes improper wash care too. I tend to nitpick fast fashion brands and go for cotton/linen/lyocell options and these pieces have stood the test of time.   Although some of these fall apart pieces are poorly made so it‚Äôs also probably part of it too.	labels:I agree.

text:Does anyone else feel that nothing is unfashionable nowadays?	labels:One of the most glaring examples of dated I‚Äôve come across was when I rewatched The Hills. I was in High School for most of the show‚Äôs run and that was PEAK fashion. I mean come on, LC and Whitney worked for Teen Vogue! But everything is sooo distinctly 2006-2010. The little fancy vests worn over a tshirt, the bubble dresses, the cropped bolero style cardigans over a cami, thick headbands, large beads, etc...

text:Sizing relationships between brands	labels:With big names in fast fashion I don‚Äôt think this will help much.  I have two pairs of pants (the Pixie style) in a size four from Old Navy and when you lay them flat, one has two inches more around the waist than the other.  I also have a pair of size four pants from H&M that are bigger than a pair of THE SAME STYLE from H&M in a size ten (the only difference is the print on the fabric).  And while I still wear both those size four and size ten pants from H&M, I recently bought two pairs in a size eight and one is too big while the other is too small (options are limited at the H&M in Kazakhstan!).  I have another H&M dress in a size six that is baggy on me, and one in a size eight that I can‚Äôt even get my arms into, much less zip up.  For online shopping I now usually only buy things that I can return locally OR that are oversized OR that are so cheap I don‚Äôt mind taking the chance of just donating them if they don‚Äôt fit.

On one hand, I've gotten too old to really follow trends closely, but on the other hand, I don't want to be one of those people who wears what was popular when he was 26 forever.  I'd feel goofy in a pair of wide-leg ankle-cut pants and a Carhartt jacket, but I also realize that black skinny jeans and plaid button-ups are past their prime.  So what's a man my age to do?

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 03, 2021	labels:Hello there I am new here in this subreddit üòÖ  Anyways I have been eye-ing for a shoe that I have been interested for a while now, that particular shoe are the "Nike Cortez Leather" (Red And Blue Varsity) which I very have grown accustomed to. I have researched this shoe and even watch certain reviews for it that I conclude that I want to buy it.  However in my case getting this variant of this shoe and to my proper size has been quite a challenge for me. It's availability is quite rare in my Country (SEA) and all the shoes that I have found are either fake knockoffs and well soldout ads for other shoe websites.  Recently within my dedication to get this shoe, I thought of just buying the "Basic" Variant of the Cortez, and dissapointment follows as I picked the wrong size for my shoe (in my haste to buy the shoe) I measured my foot and it is exactly 26cm and and alongside with the confusion for the knowledge of the older shoe that I bought which is US 12 and EU 44 "World Balance Freeman" it confused me and well....... I bought a Large Shoe üòÇ (specifically I bought the size 12 Basic Cortez). Although I placed an exchange size for an US 11, I might be in a pickle since it will still be big for me lol.  Now anyways to finally ask my question, If by somehow the exchange US 11 were still too big for me, Can I wear a WOMANS "Nike Cortez Leather" instead???? For that I will also need advice for the sizing and basically an expert knowledge in this situation. In my case all that is available for this shoe are for Womans Shoe, and within my research I read that Nike Shoes are Unisexual (but for now I need an Experts Advice on this matter) really in a pickle, so pls help ma dudes.	episode_done:True

Customers try on two of a specific item in the same size and can easily see a difference between what should be the same item.

text:Marilyn Monroe: Casual Style and Dressing for Men	labels:I think it's pretty outdated, but I don't see anything wrong with her saying she dresses for men, if that's in fact what she was doing. There are bits in here that aren't that different than what I hear people say/read on a regular basis:  > I don‚Äôt think I could dress like the illustrations in the high ‚Äì fashion magazines. For that you require what is thought as a Vogueish figure , and is, I believe, a boyish type figure and I don‚Äôt have a boyish figure.   Pretty similar to the idea that women with straighter figures can wear clothing or particular shapes that aren't traditionally feminine, but curvier women need to wear clothing that shows their curves or end up looking fat.  > You have to be friends with your clothes if you‚Äôre going to dress for men ‚Äì no too tight zippers or unnecessary doodads to make you uncomfortable! Sometimes their acceptance is just in their response, but the response tells me I am right.   I've heard this often enough: (straight) men don't appreciate complicated clothing, they don't like clothing that isn't "flattering" but might be aesthetically interesting.   I think a lot of the article's pretty silly from a modern perspective and has some eye-roll inducing lines about women not liking her clothing. However, it's not like (some) women don't dress for men at all any more. I don't think her opinions are that unusual, she's just putting them in a way that doesn't sound right for modern readers, especially because hardly anyone actually *says* they dress for men, even when they do. I don't care to dress the way MM did, and I don't share her opinions, but I also think she's conscious of playing a role here.
text:I think it‚Äôs so weird that people are saying she‚Äôs so outdated and misogynistic for saying she dresses for men when, by the way she describes it, most women still do. So many of the commenters here do the same as her, they just say, ‚ÄúI dress for myself in the context of modern fashion and culture which still is influenced by the male gaze‚Äù. I don‚Äôt see anything wrong with it besides the self delusion that these people are wearing makeup and heels just for themselves instead of the reactions they get from others. It‚Äôs the same thing! She just said it differently/ more straightforwardly. I do it too when I feel like and have zero shame. It‚Äôs fun to dress for men you like if you‚Äôre a straight woman.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:People who built your wardrobe consciously from scratch - what were your strategies?	labels:  I wore virtually nothing but mid century vintage from ages 21-27. Prior to that it was a mix of stuff from high school, college, bartending jobs, and stuff from j crew that I wasn't overly enthused about but worked. My issue at 20 was that my wardrobe was disjointed and didn't say anything about me aside from "she likes clubbing" "she likes lounge wear" and "occasionally she has to go to court."   I had always loved mid century vintage as an aesthetic and because I had disposable income but really no idea what I was doing, it became my thing and I was a purist about it. While the components of dressing exclusively on things from 60ish years ago can be somewhat complex, it's really easy to compile items that fit within those confines and that's what I did. The wardrobe was elaborate but singular.   When I was 28, I got married and had my first child of now four and mid century didn't make sense for my lifestyle anymore and frankly, I was super over it. I sold off my massive collection and then started building the wardrobe that I have now, which doesn't have a huge theme necessarily but could be described as "really nice things that I like a whole lot".   I actually described what I've done since then in a comment about JCrew here a few weeks ago, I pasted it here because this is still my advice;   Here's my secret sauce for wardrobe building, and bear in mind that I do enjoy shopping and fashion as a primary hobby so this may not be for you if you're not as into it, which, valid;   So while I do really like ASOS house brand (and all of its verticals) for avant garde/editorial fashion, those pieces tend to be rarer purchases for me at this point in my life. I buy most stuff used from places like The Real Real/eBay/poshmark. I get every email newsletter from every high end site (Moda Operandi in particular is generally produces really wearable looks) and then I'll shop for like items used. The great thing is that most fashion is cyclical so generally if a designer has produced a collection with say, really exaggerated shoulders, another designer has produced something similar in the past few seasons that will do that job, and I can buy the piece for maybe a bit more (but tbh not by much) than I would spend at the mall full price.   It does require time and effort, and it's rare that I find a piece that I'm hunting same day (which is actually pretty good in terms of impulse buying) but I've been able to build a pretty incredible wardrobe of things that I really love in this way without spending a massive amount of money.   When I'm not buying used, I like Few Moda (which has a weird membership structure that's overall been worth it,) UAL is amazing if you're diligent about shopping their price drops and site launches, sometimes Gilt (though I find their pricing to be a tad high for post season stuff) Etsy, of all places has incredible vintage and designer selections, particularly for lesser known heritage brands that have been around awhile, and for incredible pieces from emerging designers. I also really like Garmentory (great sales) and Wolf and Badger (also great sales, also much ethical) for indie and ethical designers.   I hope this helped!
text:Wait, etsy??? Please teach me how to find anything other than peasant tops or billowing blouses (forget what they are called but you get the idea) on etsy!!!	labels:So you really have to lean on their search function, particularly item type. Select "vintage" always because unfortunately for the independent designers who utilize the platform, if you select "handmade" you'll be drowned in shit that's being drop shipped from AliExpress. Then keyword search rather than category search. Etsy's categories are really confusing when creating a listing so if you select women's clothing and then skirts, you're likely to miss a whole bunch of stuff because the seller didn't select the correct categories/etsy's categories are just terrible. Better to search "silk maxi skirt" or whatever and then filter by vintage.   After awhile, you'll start seeing quality stuff from the same sellers, save their shops and subscribe to alerts. Also, seek them out elsewhere online using the shop name and you'll likely find a better price because on their Instagram or Shopify they aren't contending with etsy's fees.   Hope this helped!	episode_done:True

text:How do you think access and privilege affect your taste and sense of style?	labels:I went through a period of being really poor and lived in a bad area, and dressed more "hard", meaning I wore lots of black, camo, big boots, etc. I did it because I didn't want people to mess with me at all or think I was weak or a target. I still am not living in a great area but it's enough that I now feel safe enough to wear girly dresses, long skirts, lacy or peasant tops, and cute shoes, more typically feminine clothes. I have more money to spend on those clothes, too, but a big part of why I'm able to wear them is I literally feel more safe now. I get really defensive on here when people jerk "feminine" clothes because those clothes represent to me my situation improving, and getting both more financially secure and physically safer.
text:It‚Äôs weird, for me I have almost the opposite experience. I don‚Äôt like having to dress in a put-together feminine way... I‚Äôm much more comfortable in androgynous kinda rough looking clothes. But I feel like I get a lot more unwanted approaches from people when I‚Äôm dressed rough.   My work uniform sounds like your ‚Äúhard‚Äù style: baggy t-shirts and canvas pants, heavy boots, all black, often rather grungy. I work in a somewhat rough area and walking home can be uncomfortable. But if I walk through the same area in nice fitted jeans and a blouse no one hassles me. I think people assume I‚Äôm more vulnerable when I‚Äôm dressed rough so they‚Äôll try to push me around more.  It‚Äôs just really interesting to learn about all these different experiences we‚Äôv had and how similar situations can have such opposite effect.	labels:	episode_done:True

An knit poncho just started to unravel on the bottom and I realized how weak the wool was. I could just pull and the strand would break in half. Underwear would stretch out , leaving the elastic useless ( I have some simple cotton underwear that from 20 years ago that is going strong). Overall, I find the fabrics and elastics weak. I‚Äôm avoiding the dryer as much as possible. Oh, and cashmere is pilling quite a bit.

Going to a trendy consignment or buy/sell/trade store is another way to stay within what is currently trendy, but maybe step a little outside your usual zone at a low barrier price point.    Especially if you find yourself buying things you end up not liking due to influencers, I would unfollow them, especially the ones that do lots of hauls.  Look for some influencers that focus more on style development and shopping your own closet.

text:What's your fashion tragedy?	labels:We had a moth infestation over COVID. Normally it wouldn‚Äôt have happened, but suddenly we both stopped our suit-wearing office jobs and put all of our wool dress clothes, blazers, cashmere sweaters etc. away in a dark corner of our walk-in closet starting in March.   Then by the time we saw a moth flying around in July, the moths had already eaten holes in several items. They love the expensive stuff - cashmere, wool suits, wool coats. Our cheapie casual stuff? Our polyester athleisure? Ha, hard pass and straight for the Max Mara jacket. It cost ~ two thousand dollars in damage (two of my husband‚Äôs suits, one of mine, one dress, 3 dress pants, 3 cashmere sweaters, a wool coat); drycleaning, moth prevention and extermination combined. And it took an amazing amount of time - we had to move everything out of our closet, wash, freeze, bake and/or dryclean everything, then I probably purchased every single not-too-toxic pest control item known to man (incl. some moderately toxic bug bombs which we then had to air out our home for a few days). I think I spent about $120 just on garment bags alone. Then the buggers moved to our other closet and we repeated that process for the entry way closet. Finally had the exterminator come twice and it seems to be under control.  Quite honestly a two month nightmare, and no, not covered by homeowners insurance. We managed to get two holes rewoven (a very high level highly technical skill that only very good tailors know how to do and was $60 per hole) on two peices. I learned how to darn and fix holes in looser knits and weaves like sweaters. But god. It was so horrible.  My husband had particularly expensive stuff affected, but actually I lost more because I had more things that were just in the realm of ‚Äúis this worth $60 to repair and $20 to dry clean?‚Äù and ended up deciding no on a few of them so ended up tossing. Also one of my cashmere sweaters, though not cheap, was honestly beyond repair.

Trying to curb this desire by restricting myself to ebay/grailed for certain categories and browsing thrift stores. I haven‚Äôt bought anything outrageous (or a lot of anything) yet, but it‚Äôs taking much more effort and self-control.

text:Totally.  To me, Gen Z is a lot of clothing that isn‚Äôt work appropriate but super fun. A lot of crop tops, bra tops, spaghetti straps, usually some tummy showing, and then some baggy pants. Lots of thrifting and also cheap fast fashion. Doc Martens and other platform shoes. Very 90s/early 2000s. Long acrylic nails, false lashes. Really fun and can be a really ‚Äúhot but trashy‚Äù style   Millennial fashion is more professional/better quality/structured. Linens, trousers, heels, sandals, etc. Frankly I think it has to do with millennials having more money. Low key hair, nails and makeup. Neutral colours and patterns. It‚Äôs a more mature style   I‚Äôm 25 so I get to do both üòé woohoo	labels:I don't think it's that millennials have more money, it's that we are older, and more likely to be in the professional job phase of life.

Then I'd sit down at my desk in the corner of a large open floor, not customer-facing, and then get my clothes adjusted so they'd be decent and comfortable. Apparently someone had complained that the sheerness of my tights combined with the length of the skirt was offensive - in the space of about 2 minutes of me walking from the front door to my desk.   I was so surprised I cried. I was just so confused. I explained to my manager what the deal was with cycling in and then adjusting the skirt (manager would wear absolutely skin-tight dresses that were very short, with stilettos) but she said it was out of her hands. And apparently wearing thicker tights would make the length of the skirt less offensive? The logic continues to escape me.  So I went home in my lunch break and got changed. When they asked me to stay on longer at this temp job I quit instead. One of the most depressing jobs I've ever had. Ugh. I learned that having a business attire dresscode is not for me.	episode_done:True

Naked and famous ‚Äî too long and expensive ($50)  Uniqlo Supima cotton ‚Äî too thin, shows my nipples  Taylor stitch heavy weight ‚Äî too thick for the summer  Taylor stitch hemp cotton blend ‚Äî too thin, shows my nipples. Nice fit though   Random Amazon heavy weight cotton ‚Äî too long and loose  Next one one on my list is Kuwalla because they have the same barrel stitching construction as Velva Sheen but much cheaper at roughly $25/tshirt, and it will likely be the last one before I bite the bullet and go full Velva sheen for my tshirts.  Edit:  Just noticed WvG is based in DC. Going to give them a try.

text:How many clothes do you have? (Really?)	labels:I think the size of your wardrobe is going to depend on your climate, job, hobbies, and general lifestyle. I have a lot more clothing than that. I also live in a place with four seasons. I have outdoorsy hobbies that require some tougher clothes. I can‚Äòt wear my casual clothing to work (and I‚Äôm also holding onto some more professional clothing from a past job in case I return to that field). I don‚Äôt have a lot of disposable income either, so I always keep things like dress pants even though I never wear them in my everyday, because I can‚Äôt afford to go shopping when interviews and funerals come up.  For instance, I probably have at least 15 dresses alone, once you count all the strappy sundresses, nice work dresses, wool sweater dresses, the cocktail dresses, and the evening gown that‚Äôs in the back of my closet - and everything in between.  I swap out my clothing with the seasons and have one closet that I share with my husband, so I try to be judicious about what I keep, while giving myself grace that I don‚Äôt need to get rid of something just because I don‚Äôt wear it regularly.
text:Hobbies are a big one. I ride horses, work out, sometimes hike, and have a professional job. Along with my regular riding clothes, I have my competition clothes, chore clothes, and then the separate clothes for different workout activities, and then the rest of a "regular" wardrobe.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What types of dresses would it be practical to have on hand for common different wedding types?	labels:Nothing white (reserved for the bride). Nothing black (associated with funerals and can indicate you don't approve of the marriage in some places. Though I don't think this applies to men - a black suit would be fine).  Something relatively modest (ie. a skin tight, super short dress that shows a lot of cleavage is fine for a club, but would look out of place at a lot of weddings).   The general idea is that you should look nice, but in a group shot of all the guests at the wedding, your outfit shouldn't stand out in the crowd - the bride and groom should stand out.  As examples, I wear [this](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/cWnH5bl2EMtcEgUSExlfwJAHAStNN44dj1Zs2P4BucIvEWdmY-AYyAp6_XN5SqtAMcDQBwRaHfd6SAwzN2bUVainQDs_D8Kn14ncXrNS6OHP6CfoQZZk_o1DDn5HckkwKjN2hnBxyiKAsgwnklFp-Xt-cr4uIKRw) to winter weddings and [this](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/0d/81/3a/0d813a7aabf8c6df601eddc9003f36f5.jpg) to summer weddings.

It‚Äôs been multiple years with constant wear and everything looks brand new (structure and color held, no scruffs etc).  I‚Äôve also had a good experience with Alexander Wang boots. While typically I wear my boots to the ground in a year (honestly this happens at any price point because I wear them every single day for hundreds of days since black boots are part of my uniform) these ones are still going strong without significant signs of wear.  For jeans AG and DL1961 have held well.

text:The average man's height in the US is 5'9". 5'8" is very close to average and not a reason to worry about whether or not you can wear any particular kind of clothes.

text:Thrifting lovers, what are your favorite thrift stores?	labels:Here's my .02 on the in-person thrift stores available to me:  Goodwill: highly location and staff dependent.  There are about 4 goodwills within an hour of me.  The closest one to me is the worst.  There are both middle/high and low income neighborhoods in the area.  It's incredibly dirty and the staff is very rude.  They throw (literally) everything onto the ground, and I always hear glass shattering in the donation center.  I don't even donate there anymore.  BUT for some odd reason, they always have a great selection of blazers there.There are two other goodwill about 30-40 minutes from me in opposite directions.  Again, both straddle high and low income areas.  However, compared to the one near me they are much cleaner and and have better staff.I think finding things at goodwill just takes trial and error.  In the before times, I would go to one of the farther ones every 4-6 weeks.  I work a usual 9-5 and I would go in the evenings or the weekends for about an hour at a time.  Goodwill outlet/the bins: there is one goodwill outlet in my state and its the only GW outlet I have ever been to.  For reference on cleanliness, you were required to wear gloves and a mask strongly encouraged before anyone ever heard of covid.  If you are going to try it, go with some time and an open mind.  Do not step over the line before they open the new set of bins unless you're ready to get in a fight.  If you are looking for good fabrics but not necessarily designer or trendy, look for small charity shops.  Here is where I can usually find cashmere sweaters, leather belts, wool suit pants etc.  Antique malls/vintage shops: higher prices but where you can find true vintage  Trendy consignment and B/S/T stores: your best bet for newer and trendy items.  Prices are obviously higher than thrifting but generally still significantly off retail, and you might be able to use trade in value or consign your own items.  I like buffalo exchange a lot but there isn't one near me.  There's a few good local consignment stores near me and often the hardest part about these places is the hours - they are often not open in the evenings and very crowded on the weekends.
text:hey fellow jersey girl (I noticed on another thread) if you haven't hit Udelco in Hawthorne yet, I recommend it: http://www.udelcoinc.com/	labels:I've heard of it but I haven't been.  It's probably a little over an hour from me so not really a trip I can swing during the work day on a weekday. Also it looks like they're closed on sundays so the only day I could go is saturday.  Do you think it's worth going just to browse and buy a few things?  I don't usually haul a lot of items at once.	episode_done:True
text:Fast Fashion: What are your wardrobe all-stars?	labels:Zara coats. Every year they make these structured coats, 75% wool, around $100-$120. Variations of black, gray, camel, navy, red. Slight changes from one year to another - different lengths, pocket placement, buttons - but the vibe is the same.   I wear these babies for years, dry clean them at the end of the season and they're as good as new the following year. I've had a simple short gray one, a short military inspired navy one, a longer red one with long lapels, and I really want another gray and maybe a long black one if I can still find my size in the end of season sale.

I am located in Panama City Florida.

I have a silk dress that needs small, simple darts at the back and I have been putting it off for over a year because I just didn't know how to approach it.	labels:Just sew the smallest dart you think you will need first.

text:DAE feel they made incredibly ODD fashion purchases, this year in 2020?	labels:I did have some really odd purchases this year. I think it was a combination of increased ability to spend as I switched jobs to a more calm and lucrative field and received a promotion, as well as a realization that I was still only buying clothes to be "professional". I had some of the core basics and was still considered fashionable, but I wanted to move into more elevated fabrics, designer wear, and sustainable brands; no more bulk purchases of synthetic tops and dresses from brands like Banana Republic and LOFT for work. In more recent times I've been driven by reading the book Fashionopolis, which talks more about the environmental and economic effects of fashion, so I'm buying more secondhand options and am limited with what I buy firsthand.  A few examples of the weird shit I've bought are [this PH5 dress](https://www.ph5.com/all/frida-wavy-asymmetric-dress-4?rq=frida) in both hot pink and black, [the Roksanda dress](https://polychrome.blog/2020/11/08/shape-shift/) that this art influencer is wearing, and a Chanel wallet on chain. Also a few pieces from Self-Portrait like [this top](https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-a2sycuzmpv/images/stencil/500x800/products/378/492/SP19-027__07739.1600162951.jpg?c=1) and [this skirt](https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-a2sycuzmpv/images/stencil/500x800/products/411/466/SP18-105__29412.1600162941.jpg?c=1).  I'm still learning how to work these pieces into my wardrobe, but now that I don't need to worry about the perception of my work peers so much, I'm really looking forward to finding appropriate ways to mix these in. I've still bought a few failure pieces, but for once I'm happy because I'm not trying to fit the prescribed mold of business world and accounting fashion.

Good luck to you.	episode_done:True
text:How would you describe the quality of self-knit/self-made clothes vs. store bought?	labels:With the right materials and skill, absolutely. I‚Äôm biased because I‚Äôve been making most of my own clothes for decades(!) but the big advantage is fit. Shoulder seams at your actual shoulder, waist at your waist, blended sizes (I‚Äôm pear shaped, size S on top, M at the waist, and M+ at the hips). You can do nice details, like French seams as mentioned, lining a full lining instead of a facing,  or a nice finishing technique for a facing instead of just a serged edge. When I make coats I interline then for warmth and build in windstoppers at the sleeve openings, plus an internal pocket to hold my glasses in wet weather. Things like that.   It can be as hard to find quality yardage as quality fabric in RTW but I have so many 100% silk items that are otherwise only available at insane price points.   There are some things that take a lot of skill and time, like a crisply tailored suit. To me, a suit is not worth the effort that a marginally better fit would bring. But for most things sewing is so worth it.
text:You are so right! For me, learning to sew is my only avenue to all those luxurious details, plus it comes with the pride or not only wearing something I made but wearing something truly one-of-a-kind. It also opens up the possibility of altering clothes found at thrift stores and recycling fabric.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What did you teach your mom about fashion?	labels:Not fashion per se, but mum was always super insecure about her lips, didn't really like to draw attention to them, and I think internalised some ideas about not wearing bright lipstick after the age of 30 so spent decades in these really unflattering browns and purples, sort of stuck in the 90s aesthetic-wise.  (For reference - my mum when she was younger, looked a lot like the lady on [this book cover](https://pictures.abebooks.com/inventory/30799696293.jpg) )  I didn't really set out on an agenda or anything, but around the time I discovered bright lipsticks, I got a nice red one for mum too, simply because I was sick of the purples and browns. She made a lot of noises about how red lipsticks were 'for young people' and how she was 'too dark' (sad but v common tale among us) to wear such a bright colour for lipsticks, but I channelled her energy from when she was young and getting me to wear something I didn't want to wear, to get her to put it on. I'm v pleased to report that within a year, ALL of mum's lipsticks were some shade of red or bright pink (she bought them for herself).	episode_done:True

text:What‚Äôs a piece you bought before the pandemic, but haven‚Äôt worn a single time since because the occasion has been cancelled/we have literally nowhere to go?	labels:I was supposed to go to Hawaii with my boyfriend‚Äôs family in May. I was super excited and made a whole packing moodboard for me and him, subtly matching our outfits. The two clothing pieces that make me the saddest are the vintage green Hawaiian print sundress I got from thredUP which still has the tags on because it hasn‚Äôt been touched, and a leopard print reformation one piece swimsuit that I actually did get to wear once last summer, so at least that‚Äôs nice. I really am still hoping to save that dress for the eventual Hawaii trip, whenever that is.	episode_done:True
text:General Discussion - December 03, 2020	labels:What happened to PINK Shirtmakers (/Thomas Pink)? The website is gone, their social media accounts have disappeared too.

I refuse to ever support Everlane after the way they treated their employees, but their jeans fit really well and I have a thrifted pair.
text:Wait wait I just got into everlane because I heard they‚Äôre sustainable and ethical and all that. What happened?	labels:Everlane has actually stolen designs from smaller designers too, like one of my aquaintences.  So I definitely don‚Äôt support them.	episode_done:True
text:A Basic Guide to Useful Knitwear	labels:I just bought some Uniqlo U polo neck and mock neck sweaters  very comfortable, but already quite a bit of pilling forming already and I haven't even washed it yet (I've had it for about a month but wore each of them twice a week).  pics [1](https://i.imgur.com/smETpKk.jpg) [2](https://i.imgur.com/clRA7ei.jpg)  a bit disappointed (all my sweaters pill quickly, at least the Uniqlo ones).  but I just realized the Uniqlo U sweaters are wool-poly blends. I wonder if I went for the regular Uniqlo merino sweaters (100% wool), if I would have less issues.  or if I should move up to a different brand, like Polo Ralph Lauren, it would be sturdier. or if I should just switch to cotton
text:100% wool Uniqlo sweaters pill just as badly as the blended ones. It‚Äôs just an issue of cost and construction at the Uniqlo price point. The only way to avoid this is going upmarket, which is well worth it for a sweater that looks new after years of wear	labels:	episode_done:True

text:"freeing the titty" when you don't have "fashion boobs"?	labels:Rock the free tit! Chesty girl here (ribcage 34", bust 41"), turning 35 this year. I've been wearing bralettes and low support sports bras for 5+ years now and at first it was weird and I felt saggy. I will NEVER go back. I don't even know what proper bra size I would be at this point but I absolutely refuse to wear a molded-cup bra now.    My boobs also used to be bigger when I was heavier so they aren't the perkiest and have some stretch marks at the top, but I think they look great now that I am used to their actual shape. I used to think after losing weight that they had gotten small - because I was so used to seeing them look fucking massive in a molded cup bra. I do find myself wearing a tank top under clothes to deal with the extra cleavage issue - I hate having my boobs exposed at all - but other than that, the bralette life is the tits! (Pun intended)   To alleviate any fear you may have about future sag - my boobs look less saggy now than they did after I dropped weight - granted, I have added some upper body workouts to my life for unrelated reasons, so the added pec muscle may be helping somewhat.
text:Same. I don't do molded cup bras. Sports bras and bralettes only. Your point about them looking massive is why. I got tired of the Wiley coyote eyes being all Aooooga! (seriously, I was harassed about it at work and it affected my professional reputation. I'm also extremely self conscious of them so that sucked). I strap them in now and go about my business- reduced the bullshit by a good factor weirdly enough.	labels:I can hear the Aooooga! in my head...lol. I know what you mean! I just got so tired of my boobs feeling like they occupied the whole space between my throat and waist. My torso is much less boob-centric this way and I am happier and WAY more comfortable.	episode_done:True

text:Anyone like wearing traditional clothing from you culture?	labels:I was thinking about getting a hanbok (Korean) style dress, and my mom said I shouldn't because I would look like a crazy person. It wasn't even an actual traditional dress. It had a modern silhouette but had enough details that were reminiscent of traditional clothes.   I think our time is much freer fashion wise than our mothers' time. I don't have an actual traditional dress, but I have modernized traditional clothes. There's a kind of revival of habok in Korea. More young people are wearing and creating their own modern take on it. So jokes on my mom; it makes me seem more on trend than making me weirdly old fashioned. I also grew up in a different culture than my parents, so my connection to my roots feels more tenuous. Traditional clothes helps me feel a closeness my parents don't need to seek out.  I love traditional clothes in general. I think they are usually very beautiful and unique.
text:Yes to the modern hanbok being pretty popular in Korea! I admittedly haven't worn mine (I live in the US) as often since I've brought it back, but the modern hanbok skirts look just like wrap skirts so it shouldn't look too out of place?	labels:Yeah, it's nice that elements of both the top and bottom pieces can be work in modern clothes. The type of fabric uses is really wide as well. I think one thing that makes modernized hanbok work as everyday clothing is that you can choose how traditional it looks.   If there's anyone reading this is interesting at looking at what they look like you can look up ÏÉùÌôúÌïúÎ≥µ for modernized hanbok or ÌïúÎ≥µ for both traditional and modern on instagram.	episode_done:True
text:What‚Äôs your opinion on (modern) 90s-inspired fashion?	labels:I would love to see the minimalism and the simple neutrals of the early 90's like Jil Sander, Calvin Klein, and the like come back--like shaped, tailored, super exquisite effortless Winona Ryder/Julia Roberts/Gwyneth Paltrow on a publicity tour in 1992 lewks.	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - January 10, 2021	labels:Out of curiosity what setups are you guys using to take and edit your fit pics? Phone in a mug? Professional camera? What focal length is your lens, are you using a tripod? Anything interesting you'd like to share?  I have a 23mm lens on a Fuji X-Pro1 (APS-C, so I believe 35mm equivalent) that I usually mount on a tripod with a 10sec timer & 6-frame burst-shot. It's time consuming to set up and get a good picture because the preview is tiny and there's no e.g. WiFi sharing so my alternative setup is a phone mount for the same tripod. Recently discovered I can get a live preview from my phone on my laptop so I've been using that to browse the pictures and check I've framed everything correctly etc.  I use the lightroom mobile app to crop and edit the photos. Basically every photo is cropped because I have to stand quite far back from the camera to get everything in without distortion.

text:General Discussion - January 20, 2021	labels:My partner is now officially my spouse. I now wear a ring which will look good with my fits, but feels really weird being just ... there on my hand, all the time now.  They vetoed me posting pictures (we have public facing jobs, these pictures are all over social media, too easy to reverse image search etc.), but they wore a Rick Owens dress (that I picked out) while I went full minimalism with a collarless shirt with onyx studs, a sleek blazer and cropped trousers. I put this together from my existing wardrobe, since we didn't want to spend a lot. Covid measures made things a bit weird, but the court officer made a real effort into making it nice, which was great. (edit: just so nobody thinks we are totally irresponsible: it was literally just us at city hall, no guests, no party. We'll catch up with that after vaccination.)  It was fun seeing all y'all Americans count down to my wedding day.

text:What does your shoe wardrobe look like? What are your shoe essentials?	labels:I have a lot. I‚Äôm embarrassed to say how many.

Moving forward I will only buy a new pair if an old pair is retired.  I do not wear heels anymore because of a knee injury a couple of years back. So I mostly wear sneakers and flats and sandals and oxfords.  The problem is I have too many of them!  I buy mostly what I like. Even when I already have shoes that serve a similar purpose.

Shirts, bottoms, skirts, dresses--- Usually 3-4 times depending on use.  Skirts-- 5-6 times (these don't touch the crotch area so they don't get as dirty as other bottoms).  Outer layers (sweaters, sweatshirts, etc)--- As needed (I always have something under these).  PJs-- 3-4 wears  Sheets-- Every 2 weeks or so  Towels-- Washcloths-- after each use (I use two a day to wash my face), body towel-- after about a week.  Hair towel-- when I remember to (I only use this towel for my hair and wash my hair twice a week).  Hand towels, dish towels, etc-- as needed.  Other bedding-- (blankets, comforters, etc)--- twice a year (Spring and fall).	episode_done:True

[Front](https://imgur.com/MEvCHW8) and [back](https://imgur.com/tXuns80).  This thing is a beast. I went with /u/pumaturtle to check out the Nepenthes store and ran into this jacket way in the back. It was the only one they had left and it was a size large. For reference, I'm a small. But honestly, the sizing works out in an eccentric Japanese Popeye cityboy kind of way that even gives me a hint of avantgarde vibes, and I can really cinch the [internal drawstring](https://imgur.com/iuPg00I) to create some shape. Plus the [fur (acrylic/poly) liner](https://imgur.com/JjTP6hZ) really contributes to the oversized winter big coat parka feel of it. Oh, and there's [adjustable backpack straps](https://imgur.com/8MIP6YT).  Details are all very cool. The [signature Barbour double zipper](https://imgur.com/RiKgohB) (though I kinda wanted it in brass but oh well), corduroy internal of the storm flap, [extra padding on the elbow](https://imgur.com/svZ7Zmo) (is that an articulated dart? honestly don't know), [adjustable external and internal cuffs](https://imgur.com/FLdTez9), and [expandable/collapsable hood](https://imgur.com/FLdTez9)  Of course there's pockets. Would it really be EG without? [Two handwarmer pockets (corduroy lined) and two flapped front pockets in the classic Barbour shape](https://imgur.com/hra889A). [Two huge internal pockets](https://imgur.com/JjTP6hZ) that have the fur lining continuing inside. We got [two game pockets on the back , and even a map pocket with two-sided access complete with leather sprat's head detailing](https://imgur.com/yj406k9). So that's nine pockets in total.  Overall I'm really happy with it. I spent a lot of time deliberating because it was a hell of a deal at 50% off, but it was an unexpected discovery. I think it'll be pretty flexible though ‚Äì a Barbour waxed jacket is a classic menswear staple, but the M-51 fishtail design is a more interesting and unique take on it. The oversized nature really brings to mind the thrifted surplus fishtails that Mods used to wear with suits, but it'll also work well with Japanese-inspired milsurp too. I basically think of it as a more casual version of my navy DBF coat ‚Äì a throw-over-everything kind of coat that you can just beat to hell and it'll look great doing it  /u/TehoI /u/TradingBigWig /u/TheSharkBaitz

Sometimes I would just bring a stack of items that didn't fit well to the tailor and he'd either fix them or explain to me why it wouldn't work or why it wasn't cost effective.
text:I wondered about this! I recently lost some weight and have a few pairs of pants that I‚Äôd like to get tailored to fit. But I wasn‚Äôt sure if it was like at a salon, where you go in and tell them what you want done to your hair and they do it, or if you go in and they know how it should fit so they do it their way. Cause I have NO clue what I‚Äôd say if they asked how I wanted it tailored!	labels:It's tough to tell before you go in. Generally, if it's a stand-alone shop, they should be an expert tailor. If it's someone in a cleaners, it's a crap-shoot. Some of them pretty much just do hems and would need you to tell them what you want, but there's one in a cleaners near me which is the THE tailor recommended by the fancy bridal shops.  Read reviews. If people mostly just say they hemmed pants in a timely fashion, they're probably not an expert tailor. If people talk about how they made their suit fit like it was bespoke, it's probably legit.	episode_done:True

text:I kept my head clean-shaven for 3 years before moving toward a more retro styled crew-cut.     Things to be aware of:      \-It's cold as fuck. Make sure you own at least one nice/warm beanie that goes with most of your outfits.  \-Don't forget to moisturize! use a light moisturizer like you would on your face. I'm fond of the Ursa Major face lotion, it's not too thick or greasy.  \-you don't have to use a razor, but if you do, prepare to have lots of little cuts on the top of your head the first 3-4 times you do it. It's very itchy. Your whole head can get razor burn if you're not careful. I would recommend just using clippers to take it down to a zero. If you like how that looks, and you want to go for baby's bottom smooth, it's worth it to invest in a Foil Shaver. When I was shaving my head, I would hit it with clippers at a zero followed by the foil shaver, then witch hazel, then moisturizer.     \-IF U R WHITE, certain outfits that look great with a full head of hair look very uhhh, nazi adjacent when you shave your head. I wear very plain clothing for the most part, my go-to outfit is Corcoran jump boots, black slim Outlier pants, a white tee shirt and a black buzz rickson MA-1.  I would avoid wearing this when i had a shaved head unless I knew I was gonna be wearing a hat the whole day, especially to concerts, because I wouldn't want to give anyone the wrong idea or make someone feel unsafe. Depending on your style of dress and your scene/social circle, this won't be a problem, but it's something to keep in mind.     Answers to your questions:     Use a gentle soap on your head. If you have a really good body wash, that'll do, otherwise soaps meant for babies are generally good for a bare scalp. As your hair starts to grow back in, you'll want to use WAAAY less shampoo and conditioner than you normally would, I mean teeny tiny little dollops. You'll get a feel for how much to use pretty instinctually.     Don't have to wear hats on sunny days, but you ABSOLUTELY should wear sunscreen on your head.  A sunburn right on the button of your crown is absolutely the most miserable sensation in the world.     Everyone's hair grows at different speeds. Assuming you shave your dome and then don't touch it after, it would probably take between 2 and 5 months to get back to a length like that.     It's some work and maintenance, but less so than having a haircut that needs to be styled. Plus it's SO NICE to step out of the shower and have a completely dry head with one shake of a towel. Cuts WAY down on prep time in the morning and you'll literally never have a bad hair day for as long as you're rocking it.	labels:	episode_done:True

Fake refined chic, just like everything else I own. What‚Äôs in my bag you ask? A sleek day planner filled with pretty handwriting detailing a vibrant, busy social life? MAC lipsticks? Dior sunglasses? Expensive dry shampoo? A bottle of Chanel perfume?

text:Review your winter 2020/2021 outerwear: how did your coats and sweaters hold up this season? Would you recommend your specific brand to someone looking for warm layers. Did you add anything new to your winter wardrobe that stands out?	labels:I absolutely hate wearing layers and I am willing to spend hefty amounts on coats in order to prevent wearing multiple layers (even 2-3 layers is just... too much). I'm a baby when it comes to winter, although it's fairly mild in Seattle, and I've gotten terrible respiratory illnesses when I've fucked up with not wearing enough.  The one item I'll keep no matter what is my Patagonia [Nano Puff](https://www.patagonia.com/product/womens-nano-puff-jacket/84217.html). It's an amazing layer under wool coats and atop any thermals or mid-layers, though it's definitely not insulating enough on its own, at least for me. My only wish is that it had a hood, but I can't complain since it was a gift from my employer.  I ended up buying a puffer (the water and wind proof [Super Puff](https://www.aritzia.com/us/en/product/the-super-puff‚ÇÇo‚Ñ¢/79434.html) from Aritzia). I sized up to a medium so I could layer up massively underneath. I do think it'll work fine for when I inevitably hit the snow, and it's served its purpose as an *oh god it's cold and I need to walk the dogs at midnight* coat. I wear this 95% of the time.  I also have an [Arc'teryx coat](https://outlet.arcteryx.com/us/en/shop/womens/osanna-coat) that I'd intended to use after buying it during spring sales, but its insulation was not dense enough for near-freezing temps unless I layered, and again, I hate layering. I think I'm probably going to resell this since it also doesn't have a zip and has to be manually buttoned, which would be fine... if it was warm.  I didn't end up wearing my leather jackets (one is a thrifted pale peach/nude, the other is a black Allsaints Balfern biker) because I didn't anticipate I'd layer anything underneath. So those are waiting for spring to rear its head again.  I've also been rotating through a small wool coat collection, and I've decided I want to donate/sell all asides from my [cocoon coat](https://www.aritzia.com/us/en/product/the-cocoon-coat/48560.html), which is a solid neutral for me and looks good alone or layered. I still want a black wool coat with huge, obnoxious lapels, but wool coats and I are not meant to be in rainy weather. ^(btw if anyone has good recs please give me them)  Finally, I bought a [shearling jacket](https://i.imgur.com/Vg6E1RA.jpg), which I'd like to use as a fashion-forward replacement to the puffer and a warmer competitor to my wool coats.

I have a few pairs of these LL Bean wool no-slip ones that really wore poorly. They are sort of snug and I think I just strained the weave. I should have sized up.	episode_done:True
text:What are your feelings on thrifting from ‚Äúproblematic‚Äù brands?	labels:The company already made money off of the original purchase of the shirt, so you buying second hand doesn‚Äôt really benefit them in any way. If you really want the item, buying it second hand is probably the most ethical choice you can make. If someone asks where the piece is from, just say you don‚Äôt know so they won‚Äôt be tempted to buy from the brand lol
text:But the second question is where to buy second hand from? For example near me we have the Salvation Army and a church thrift shop. I used to live next to a giant Salvation Army donation center and loved it, but after learning about their philosophy and some of the shady things they‚Äôve done I no longer feel like I can ethically support them! Then supporting the local church thrift is also problematic given their stances on social issues! When I lived in California I was able to find some thrift stores that actually gave to causes I support (out of the closet etc) but now that I‚Äôm in the Midwest there aren‚Äôt any of these! I just want like a thrift store that donates to something like education or food banks without the religious/social aspect.	labels:In my part of Canada, basically the only two thrift stores are Value Village (for-profit company which donates a portion of its proceeds to a diabetes charity), and Goodwill By Salvation Army (non profit/charity I believe? With a history of discrimination against LGBT community and poor treatment of workers with disabilities)   The most common reaction I get, when people say "where did you get that sweater" and I say "Value Village", is  "ewwww, didn't you know that's a for profit company! You're wasting your time buying used, you're so foolish thinking you're a good person when you're just supporting some *corporation*, that's so gross, you're just as bad as me so don't pat yourself on the back for shopping there, you capitalist!"   And like... Really?? Wtf is up with that response? I'd rather support a for-profit used clothing store, than a for-profit new clothing store like Walmart or Forever 21. Isn't doing something better than doing nothing? Or, as the saying goes," don't let perfection be the enemy of good?"    (especially when my only alternative to value village is... Pretty much the last charity I'd want my money going to)	episode_done:True
text:Accessories newbie and am not sure where to start...what are your must-have starter pieces?	labels:I buy a lot of my jewelry from amazon, actually. I've also dabbled in etsy jewelry a little bit (under $30 range). I know everyone has a different idea of "quality," but I've been extremely impressed with the quality I've received from both amazon and etsy. It is definitely a step up from the jewelry you could get at Target or even Madewell.  I look for gold-plated or gold vermeill (also gold plated but it is plated over silver instead of other metals) since my budget is pretty tight. I started by buying a few different sized gold hoops, plain gold layering chains , and a few rings. I occasionally wear silver but I already had quite a bit accumulated over the years and find myself reaching for gold more often these days. I hope to be able to invest in fine jewelry someday, but what I can find on amazon or etsy in my current price range checks all the boxes for me.
text:Love Etsy, but never even thought about it for jewelry. Thank you!	labels:I get ALL my jewelry from Etsy.

text:Down Jackets	labels:Brilliant, mostly parkas. I‚Äôm glad to see no Canada Goose coats, those are dreadful. I will say 3 or 4 years ago I was in Montreal in December, coldest week in 10 years. Canada Goose jackets looked mighty appealing then haha. I feel a lot down jackets are very trimmed down now though similar to the Patagonia Down Sweaters which are super versatile and light weight, any reason you didn‚Äôt include those?
text:Just curious, why are Canada Goose coats dreadful? I love mine	labels:I live in NE Ohio which is not a climate that requires Canada Goose jackets. They have become a status symbol now, at least in climates where they aren‚Äôt necessary. They are well built but the price tag is steep. Thats just my honest opinion, if you like them, keep wearing them. We are talking about goose down which has a lot of animal welfare issues and we are really grasping at straws in the difference, but it seems like canada goose is a lot more problematic in this respect.	episode_done:True

text:ModCloth Returns to ‚ÄúIndependent‚Äù Ownership	labels:I always want to want to love ModCloth but they‚Äôre so expensive and so *inconsistent*. You knew how things were going to fit or what the quality was. I know things came from all over designer wise so it‚Äôs hard to really control for size that way but it was still frustrating as the consumer. Post Walmart acquisition the quality absolutely went down and their pieces really lost that kinda retro funk they were known for. I still pop by once in awhile, maybe things will turn around for them again	episode_done:True
text:What are some habits that keep clothes/shoes new vs that habits that ruin them?	labels:When I buy nice shoes, I take them to my shoe repair guy before I wear them and he puts a vibram bottom on the front part and swaps out the heel tap for a more durable one. It makes a huge difference in their longevity and gives the sole a better grip. It‚Äôs also important to replace the heel taps when they wear down, and get any gouges fixed (again, by the shoe repair dude) ASAP.
text:How much do you usually pay for that, if you don‚Äôt mind? I really wanted to have that done myself, but the place I went to was going to charge $55. More than I wanted to spend at the time.	labels:I usually pay about $5 for a pair of heel taps. If the heels themselves are really damaged, that might require some resurfacing and additional work. The estimate may increase to $20. In our area $55 would be outrageous - a full boot zipper replacement is about $75.	episode_done:True

text:Discussion: Clay Jewelry?	labels:I‚Äôm the type of person that wears the same earrings that I never take out, so I no longer buy new pieces unless I‚Äôm intending it to replace what I‚Äôm currently wearing. That said I really love the look of clay jewelry from an artistic standpoint! I used to do clay art so I can really appreciate the skill that goes into creating each one. Obviously you do need to be more careful with these pieces than metal jewelry, but I think they are worthwhile since, as you note, they tend to be very affordable for a handmade piece. I recently found [Valley + Vetiver](https://valleyvetiver.com/) on twitter and I actually follow her even though I don‚Äôt buy new jewelry, just to admire her art! I especially love the pieces in her Fruitful Collection [Strawberries](https://twitter.com/valleyvetiver/status/1297317013618978817?s=21) [Oranges](https://twitter.com/valleyvetiver/status/1298380424456986624?s=21) [Blueberries](https://twitter.com/valleyvetiver/status/1298682165085888512?s=21)  Edit to fix grammar :)
text:Hey, do you mind sharing what brands you've purchased before for earrings that you never take out? This is me exactly and I've had the same pairs of screw on earrings for years. Looking to switch things up a bit! Personally I prefer the screw on ones, otherwise if the ends are sticking out, they end to hurt when I'm lying down	labels:Sure! Unfortunately this isn‚Äôt super helpful because my tastes are boring. I wear a pair of stainless steel 14mm sleeper hoops in my main piercings which are from a company called 365 Sleepers on Amazon. I‚Äôve worn the same pair daily for around 2 years now and have noticed zero wear on them. They‚Äôre incredibly lightweight, and because there is no hinge where hoops would ordinarily have one, I really don‚Äôt even notice them. Can‚Äôt recommend these ones enough.  I also wear the screw back ones in my second set of piercings! I‚Äôm not brand loyal and I have found a ton of success looking on Etsy.	episode_done:True
text:Does Anyone Ever Feel Like It‚Äôs Hard to Find Basic Clothing Items That Were Plentiful in the Past?	labels:I don't know if I'd consider a velvet dress a basic item.  My basic item is a good quality fitted tee and tank.  Old Navy used to be the place to buy these things but their quality has gone downhill a lot.  I just want a tee or tank that is good for layering, but is not so sheer that I can't wear it alone.  Is something made with fabric heavier than tissue paper too much to ask?  (And by fitted, I don't mean the Everlane oversized/boxy fit.  If I wanted that, I'd shop in the men's section.)

text:What did people *actually* wear in 2000's?	labels:From 2001-2005, clothing I wore as a high schooler/college kid: low rise bootcut jeans, fitted graphic tshirts, fitted polo shirts, fitted shirts in general (shirts were so tight- maybe that‚Äôs why we layered??), always layering shirts- and shirts were super long and over your hips, but tight- never tucking them in, cutoff denim skirts, cotton shorts (like soffees) with words on the butt, necklace with my first initial on it, platform flip flops, dresses with Hawaiian prints (like flowers or surfers etc), hoop earrings, fitted hoodies. That‚Äôs what I can remember.
text:> fitted graphic tshirts  does anyone else remember the trend from 2002-2005 or so where all the graphic tee shirts had fake businesses on them, with logos and slogans and illustrations and everything like one would a real ad? i saw it a handful of places but remember it most vividly from abercrombie and comparable stores at the time like hollister & aeropostale.

text:What do you think are the pieces of jewelry everyone should own?	labels:I'm very, very anti diamond. There are plenty of other sparkly stones you can wear that aren't expensive and are less detrimental to the humans that mine them. I do own a pearl necklace, but I only wear it in situations where I'm trying to look older or more mature (I'm in my 30s). I wouldn't wear anything on your list regularly, tbh.  For me, the pieces that have stood the test of time are:  - a simple flat silver necklace  - a silver ring with a single chalcedony cabochon   - small turquoise stud earrings  - a lapis lazuli beaded necklace  What is "timeless" for one person wont be the same for another.

text:What is your favourite item from a discount brand?	labels:I have a 10+ year old floral dress from Kohl‚Äôs. It magically works for any occasion, doesn‚Äôt wrinkle, and needs no special care.  Works for a pool coverup, a bike ride, and a wedding. It also magically works across size fluctuations. I have gone 2 up and 2 down and it still looked cute.
text:Not familiar with kohl‚Äôs as I am in Canada. What other brands would they be akin to ? Dress like that sounds amazing!	labels:Kohl‚Äôs is a low to mid tier department store. A bit like Target without the food/toilet paper stuff, and lower end than Macy‚Äôs. Fancier than Walmart. But it is like the unhip middle age mom suburban store - so you are supposed to be embarrassed to shop there. ü§£ü§£ü§£  Now in retrospect, I might have actually bought this dress when I was still in my 20s, barely! And now I am 42.   They have a wide mix of ‚Äúexclusive‚Äù brands, and mass market ones like Levi‚Äôs, Nike, and Lee.   The ones I have the best luck with are the Elle brand (like Elle Magazine). And the Apartment 9 brand - which is like Target‚Äôs Merona and the Hudson stores INC.	episode_done:True
text:It‚Äôs 2021. A vaccine for the virus has been made widely available and businesses may operate at full capacity, including bars, clubs, salons, etc. How will this influence fashion?	labels:I have bought so much nice (and often designer) stuff on steep discounts these past 7 months that I cannot wait to wear it all. Fashion will be at its peak next spring, summer, and fall.  The anonymity of face mask wearing has been wonderful for me on a personal level; I wouldn‚Äôt dream of experimenting with some statements and combinations outdoors but the facemask really emboldened me to try new things and get comfortable wearing them outside. I feel like 50% of style is attitude and once masks are gone and I am not anonymous, I will still have the confidence and daring to rock cooler, bolder looks
text:Interesting. I'm the opposite. The face mask has made me not care. Makeup will get rubbed off by the mask on my already irritated skin from said mask. I want to wear chapstick or lipstick again. That's the only makeup I can realistically wear outside of tinted moisturizer since I'm sensitive to all eye makeup. :/	labels:I feel you on this. Smeared makeup is not fun.	episode_done:True

text:All things K-Fashion!	labels:I wonder if the 2020 trends (logos, maximalist shapes, general flamboyancy) will actually play out in the US in the next year or so, when there's a tendency to minimize in times of economic recession. Or do you think it's the Gen Zeers who are mostly into K -fashion? If the trends persist, it'd probably be through the generation that isn't at risk of being laid off.  I like the simpler "classic feminine" styles and the fitted silhouettes. Not big into the ruffles.
text:> Or do you think it's the Gen Zeers who are mostly into K -fashion?   K-fashion has been popular among Millennial Kpop/Kdrama fans since like the 2010s. It's one of the reasons why sites like Yesstyle is so popular.	labels:Thanks, I didn't know. I'm a millennial but have more or less been ignorant to Kdrama and pop.

text:The idea is "timelessness" is more a marketing ploy than anything else. Nothing is timeless and the outlook of optimizing your wardrobe like that kills the creativity behind developing a personal fashion style. If you only care about utility and timelessness then you're probably not interested in fashion.	labels:While digging in my closet, I found a newish t-shirt from the 1990s, I put it on and was aghast at how something as basic as a t-shirt has changed so much. I thought t-shirts were timeless. It was boxy, loose, eew.

Most of my clothes are currently in storage while waiting to move to new house

text:Best and Worst Purchase of 2020	labels:Best - a stunning Dion Lee drop waist pleated dress on eBay. $500 second hand  - way more than I‚Äôd usually spend on anything - but it is my absolute grail dress and goes with a suit jacket for work and heels and sneakers to lunch just as well.   Worst - mid thigh gym shorts, tights style. They do not flatter me at all. I bought four brands. I hate them all. They are now going the way of collared shirts. Things that look great on some people, and I am not one of them.
text:So much this. I got 2 pairs of biker style shorts thinking I'll look like those IG models, effortlessly edgy and cool. Turns out my legs are short and they cut me off in the way that it makes them look even shorter + they dig into my things making them uncomfortable. I tried making them work with different outfits but truth be told they never left the walls of my apartment. They somehow also remind me of legging style shorts I wore as an 8 year old and it's not a look. They are now somewhere at the back of my closet reminding me of my failure and how I shouldn't trust Instagram trends.  Honestly my big 2021 resolution is to not buy into trends I saw on Instagram. Most of the times they 1) dont work with my body type 2) are worn in situations I'm rarely in (I live in a cooler climate, I don't need more than 2 bikinis!) 3) are either fast fashion or very expensive and not worthy of spending money on.	labels:That‚Äôs mine too.

I can't own five old stuffy british structured business suits with stiff shoulders -- I'm a lawyer, and even I don't have occasion to wear them. Even in NYC, if I wear a suit + tie to a bar, I'm almost in costume.  I like suits, so I want one casual enough I can wear it in places you're not supposed to wear suits. Spalla camicia isn't the be-all end-all of casual tailoring, but it's a cool fucking option.	labels:I take your point. Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm almost 40, but I want less and less to frequent places where you‚Äôre not supposed to wear suits!   That being said, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs bad, just overrated.

text:What I Like is Not What I choose to wear	labels:What I like to look at and what I like to wear are not the same thing. I actually think a lot of fashion struggles come from people not understanding how to separate what they find aesthetically interesting from what meets the specific needs in their life.  When you look at a photo of an outfit, you're not *just* reacting to the outfit itself. You're also reacting to the body of the model, the styling choices (makeup and hair), and the photography decisions (the pose, the location, the lighting).   I might look at a photo and think "that person looks so cool in that outfit," but that person isn't me. I would not look that cool in that outfit because I'm a completely different person.  When I choose clothing for myself it needs to satisfy my aesthetic tastes when paired with my body and the amount of effort I'm willing to put into styling (i.e. zero), as well as suit the needs for my daily life. That's actually a limited number of options for me.   But when I am admiring an outfit or a photo, I'm not constrained by my hang ups about my body or the needs of my daily life. I can just like the outfit without having to contextualize it around myself, which is actually quite nice.  So, personally speaking, my interest in fashion isn't limited to clothing I would choose to wear. I find it's much more freeing to allow myself to enjoy fashion and outfits without always questioning whether I would like the outfit on my own body.
text:This is a Good Comment.  Especially the part about reacting to the model's body and styling as well as the items of clothing. And man, it can be real tough to come to terms with that sometimes. Having a cohesive style certainly helps with the styling aspect in these situations, but the part about the body is rife with stress and emotion for a lot of people. There's no one right way to deal with that. Everyone just needs to find the line between what they like and what they actually want.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Synthetics in Our Wardrobe	labels:I think its important to take into consideration that sure synthetic fibres are easier to acquire nowadays and its the ‚Äònew‚Äô thing to turnover plastic into these fabrics however, we need to think of biodegradability. Although these synthetic fibres are accessible they are not as easy to degrade into the earth as natural fibres. Look into this and think about it when shopping. I personally own items that are made of synthetic fabrics but have purchased them second hand so they are already pre-existing.  I feel grateful to have so many options accessible to me here in the GTA, so I now purchase about 90% of my clothing second hand.	episode_done:True
text:Can you have a clothing style without actually wearing that certain style much?	labels:This isn‚Äôt a direct answer to your question, but I‚Äôve found I have a ‚Äòhopeful‚Äô sense of style and a ‚Äòrealistic‚Äô sense of style.  Hopeful-me will think about buying a teal floral wrap dress because it‚Äôs gorgeous. Realistic-me knows it will sit in my closet untouched for 3 years because I don‚Äôt wear teal!   I‚Äôve learned to differentiate between the two while I shop, at least. If I was a celebrity suddenly, maybe I would lean towards hopeful-me‚Äôs style, but for now I am normal and realistic!
text:Yes this! I call it ‚Äúideal style‚Äù and ‚Äúreal style‚Äù. My ‚Äúideal style‚Äù involves a lot of flowy, Christy Dawn-style dresses. My actual, ‚Äúreal style‚Äù is way more simple - in my free time I wear a lot of plain t-shirts, sweaters, and jeans/shorts. I‚Äôve bought a couple of absolutely lovely dresses over the years that I never wear, but will reach for my favorite Everlane t-shirts and comfy sweaters over and over again.	labels:I also call it my fantasy style! I've done the opposite of most people and I've made myself start dressing more like Fantasy me. I have depression so I've been exploring my fantasy lives and why she's happy. And one thing is she's always cute! I know it's stage but it helps. Dressing like the me I want to be helps me become her.	episode_done:True

Pretty small market at that price range, especially when high quality die-cut, machine-sewn leather bags are available for closer to $400 and imported bags can be had for like $200. Not many people are willing to pay 2-4x as much purely because it‚Äôs handmade.	labels:You're post made me appreciate the bags my wife buys even more. She got a vintage Celine weekend bag last year in fantastic condition for $370. It's a fantastic bag and it's made me want my own leather duffel, I just couldnt justify the price.  Seeing the work and effort really makes that decision easier to make.	episode_done:True
text:I love all the new leather clothes this fall, what have you bought?	labels:I've bought a little bit of genuine leather and a whole lotta faux leather.

Genuine: a Barneys Originals leather jacket off asos that I found on here. It was immediately returned as the quality was just not good.  Shoes and such: I've also bought the Dr. Marten Jadons, suede dolce vita knee high boots, and stuart weitzman croc-look leather booties  ETA:I didn't realize how much faux leather I bought until I typed it all out. I typically avoid faux leather in items like bags, belts, and shoes but I have fallen prey to all the cool faux leather clothing items out right now. I haven't received the H&M items yet and will return anything cheap looking. I enjoy finding real leather secondhand much more than buying cheap new faux items anyway.

Same with hairstyle. I know men get judged for these things too but definitely to a lesser extent. Just look at every talk show or news report/anchor: men can wear the same style dress shirt every night for years, but if a woman wears the same blouse two nights in a row, that‚Äôs not really going to fly.  I was teased as the ‚Äòstriped shirt girl‚Äô because I wore a lot of striped shirts because it‚Äôs what I love, but I was a teen and it made me feel obligated to ‚Äòexplore fashion‚Äô. A stupid waste of time, because I love what I love and it only wasted my time and money as a young adult ‚Äòexploring‚Äô only to come back to... striped shirts. Now I just wear them happily.	episode_done:True

While as he states his channel is a bit more focused on menswear than womenswear, I really enjoy his videos in general and especially perspectives on the places where business and culture collide.  He shares some interesting context and background about Jil Sander (others may know, it was new to me), and then goes through the collection a bit in real time.  In particular, I found the description interesting of how this is the second such collab that has hit during an economic downturn.  And how Jil Sander is very future-oriented, and energized by utilizing technological advances to work with new and better materials.  I didn't purchase anything and wasn't really plugged into this collab ahead of time, but I'm also curious to hear from folks who did, who tried to, or who may keep trying.  I also saw the first few wildly inflated listings hit Ebay because I spend waay too much time on Ebay, but fuck those people.

I could never fit the belly in Medium though, hence why I wear Large.   Stringer tanks seem to be made to be made so that they're pretty loose, but fit snug on a guy with large traps, something I definitely lack.

text:How would you describe the quality of self-knit/self-made clothes vs. store bought?	labels:Yes, for sewing. I have no idea about knitting. I'm not sure why people are saying not for knits - I use a serger and a coverstitch machine to get a professional finish.   As someone else said, wearing clothing custom made to your measurements feels amazing.   I also like that I know exactly the conditions in which my clothes were made, since I'm the person who made them.   One thing I struggle with is finding top quality fabric, especially knits. I think it's due to 1) price exceeds my budget 2) I'm ordering online and don't have access to a fabric district 3) maybe nice knits just aren't available to home sewists? I'm not sure, I'm still looking. I think I finally found a source for rayon/spandex tee shirt fabric.

I have finally found cotton lycra and French Terry from a supplier that is high quality and its so expensive, I pay between $30 and $45 AUD per meter and its all pre-order so I wait 4-8 weeks to receive it.

I'm doing it for *me*, you know, because feeling sexy while I'm all by myself is much more important than being comfortable. Sure, it's easier to get coffee and cheeto stains out of my bathrobe than a 100% wool dress, but cheetos aren't sexy either.

text:How do you care for your expensive/fragile pieces?	labels:First of all, **wash everything as little as possible.** That may mean upping your deodorant/sweat control/sweat absorption game. Wear undershirts to keep your skin separated from nicer items. If you're a very sweaty person, you can even get armpit pads. For the longevity of your clothing, there is no cleaning method better than not cleaning. As others have said, wash everything on cold and don't dry anything you are trying to keep nice (even t-shirts). Find a good dry cleaner. Spot clean. If it's just a matter of scent (stinky armpits in jackets and sweaters), it may be more effective to "de-stink" them rather than clean them. (Dry-cleaning and washing don't always remove smells anyway.) I keep a small spray bottle of alcohol with a few drops of lavender oil (or you can buy the spray hand sanitizer from Dr. Bronner, it's basically the same thing). Spray liberally in the armpits and let dry. I've used this successfully with many different items, but always be careful and do a test first if you're worried about the alcohol causing spots.  **Proper storage.** Knitwear should always be stored flat. For everything that hangs, get proper hangers ‚Äì NO wire and none of those space-saving flat velvety ones, except possibly for very light shirts. It's worth it to get hangers the width of your shoulders so your clothes aren't stretched out or drooping off the hangers. Yes, this kind of hanger will take up a lot more room in your closet. Hang pants from padded clips. If they're not padded enough and seem like they might leave marks (for example on leather) then make extra pads from a few folds of felt.  **Treat stains immediately.** Get the proper stain remover for the type of stain ‚Äì different types need different cleaning products ‚Äì and treat it ASAP. The longer you wait, the longer it's likely to stick around.  **Careful with sunscreen, creams, and makeup around collars and cuffs.** Avobenzone and oxybenzone, common ingredients in sunscreen, react with your sweat to form ugly yellow stains, esp. on white clothing. Do NOT use bleach, which will make it worse. Oxyclean and similar cleaners sometimes work to get rid of these. In summer, when I wear a lot of white t-shirts, I use a special sunscreen on my neck to keep these stains from happening.  **Be careful with color rubbing off.** I have certain jackets and bags ‚Äì white anything, and all pale leather ‚Äì that I can't wear with many pairs of jeans because the blue inevitably rubs off onto them.

text:How has the quality changed over the years at some of your fav brands?	labels:I am fussy about picking clothes that fit and I like, and I usually take good care of them, and got storage space, so I got some lots of pretty old clothes clothing around. There is a sample bias effect though, that if I got a pair of 10 year old pants or a 15 year old tote (from a defunct brand), I might not remember the pants or totes I bought around then which did not last or that I got rid of for one reason or the other...  But I think a lot of brands the quality decreased. HM is a big offender, I like things on site and then touch them live and the materials are so statickey, awful hand feels. LOGG used to have better materials and maybe still has but the cuts are soo eurgh, off my taste somehow, and they did not used to be. Their conscious line might be better but for price, it is Cos prices, which is so much better all round (when I buy stuff at cos stores, my credit or debit card line says HM....). Cos quality is as good as ever, maybe better? Now they put more pockets in stuff which I love.  Zara is about the same as 10 or 15 years ago, though they erased the Trafaluc tag  though there is still that quality distinction (listed as TRF online, and still  on the same place on physical stores LOL. Zara Woman always near the entrance, trafaluc at the bottom, zara basic on racks on the center....). Their shoe quality might have become better, or dunno, their mould just fits my shoes, but I love their "soft leather" shoes. Massimo Dutti probably better than before, except their scarves, which now are often viscose-modal, and I really miss the 100% wool or silk. Viscose on scarves is better than polyester but still, I do not like it.

text:What are your favourite ways to style a black leather moto jacket?	labels:People have already covered the dresses, but the dress/leather jacket combo is for sure one of my favorite ways to style them. If there's enough room in the sleeves/body, i sometimes layer a hoodie underneath during colder weather for a more skater girl type of look. I love wearing it with a white top, light wash jeans, and my black leather combat boots (for me, doc martens but could be any boot with a similar color/texture to the jacket) bc i feel like a rocker from the 80s.

text:People with an over the top personal style, how do you incorporate it into your day to day?	labels:I'm a dress historian and I spend a lot of time in historical clothing for a variety of reasons; I feel as much at home in baroque, rococo, and Victorian clothing as I do in contemporary styles... and I bring a lot of that back into my everyday clothing.  For me it was very much about identifying the things that make historical clothing feel like it doesn't belong in modern fashion, and, when you really get down to it, it's not very much; long hemlines, skirt supports, certain types of high maintenance hairdos, completely excessive trim.   But that leaves *hundreds* of delightful little features--whether it's the angle the sleeve is set, or how the volume of the skirt sits, or the type of fabric used--that you can still use in your every day style, and depending on how far you want to push it, can be hardly noticeable or it can be very noticeable indeed but still without seeming unreasonable.  Even if you stick out a little bit, as long as your clothing is practical and isn't a complete eyesore I don't think anyone has a right to complain.  Remember that.  The more confident you are in your clothing, the more likely people are to accept and even admire what you're wearing.  Personally I love seeing what people come up with when they're really having fun with clothing, and I know a lot of other people do as well... and to be honest I think the sort of people who look down upon unique clothing choices are the sort of people whose opinions you aught not pay much mind to.

text:Skirts and dresses in winter - how to look good and be warm with a combo of boots, socks, tights?	labels:Not a specific answer to any of your questions, but:   I like to pair combat boots with chunky, cozy-looking socks with tights and a dress. I'm not sure what the climate is like where you live but if it gets at all icy or snowy, normal dressy boots tend to be a hazard. But well cared-for Dr. Martens, whose look is softened by the thick socks, handle much better in nasty weather while still looking more fashionable than straight up snow boots.
text:WHAT I lived in my docs in high school and I was always slipping on the ice. perhaps they weren‚Äôt in as good as condition by senior year lol but they were a straight up hazard	labels:Yeah, I love my Docs but something about the rubber sole apparently freezes and doesn't have great traction on ice. :(	episode_done:True
text:How do you dress for the (extreme) weather where you're from?	labels:FL here, my go-to is crop tops and jeans (only because if I wear shorts I leave a sweaty thigh print wherever i sit), and a light jacket tied around the waist for when I inevitably go into a public building that‚Äôs blasting the A/C.	episode_done:True

text:Ever been censored at work because of what you wear?	labels:I am super progressive but I agree with the school, teachers should not be wearing clothing with any kind of messaging whether it be Trump, Jesus, or feminism. You are not held to the same standard as students obviously. You are an employee and a professional. I would not wear any kind of messaging in my workplace either and if a fellow colleague did I would find it inappropriate even if I agreed with what it said.

text:What's your fashion tragedy?	labels:I spent like two months investing in a bunch of nice wool sweaters that I could wear through the winter, put them in a separate laundry bin after wearing so I could launder them myself, but my ex washed and dried them on high heat and they all shrunk so badly that I couldn't even fit them on my dog. About $1500 gone.

If I left him to do it with no supervision, everything would be ruined.	labels:I'm in charge of laundry, husband is in charge of dishes. That was our deal when we got married.  We both do each other the common courtesy involved (e.g. I rinse my dishes and put them in the dishwasher, he puts his dirty clothes in the correct hamper and hangs his gym clothes to dry beforehand, etc.) 12 years and 2 kids and it's still a good system for us.	episode_done:True

text:All-time favorite cold weather pieces?	labels:I have a few I love. During winter my priorities are warmth and style, but it‚Äôs one of those things where it‚Äôs like ‚Äúaffordable, warm, stylish - pick two.‚Äù  - [La Canadienne boots](https://www.lacanadienneshoes.com/us/boots?gclid=CjwKCAjw_Y_8BRBiEiwA5MCBJh87mssT207of8rev5aeZ1P_kFaMaqB9wMGBIUIBYKWlXXVCH7DXmhoCD2gQAvD_BwE) - Yes, these are expensive. But they are sleek, stylish and waterproof. I got [my booties](https://www.nordstrom.com/s/la-canadienne-sara-waterproof-chelsea-boot-women/5545412?utm_channel=low_nd_seo_shopping&utm_source=google&sp_source=google) on a spring sale for $220 and I regret not buying a back up pair. For actual boots, be warned, they are famously narrow-calved. [Blondo](https://blondo.com/collections/booties) is a cheaper alternative and often has similarly [sleek looks](https://www.nordstrom.com/s/blondo-siena-waterproof-bootie-women/5623136).  - [Overland Hollis Shearling Gloves](https://www.overland.com/products/womens-hollis-shearling-lined-lambskin-leather-gloves-70152?cl=bltn) - I LOVE these gloves because they are shaped like delicate ladies gloves (admittedly slightly less slim) but are not flimsy and cold. LOL at the ‚Äúcashmere lined‚Äù bullshit that feels like a thin papery pleather. Shearling is substantial and plush and it will keep you much warmer than other ‚Äúladylike‚Äù gloves (but not as warm as say [hulky ski/snow gloves](https://m.shopbop.com/arctic-down-gloves-canada-goose/vp/v=1/1562477539.htm?extid=SE_froogle_SC_usa&currencyCode=USD&ef_id=CjwKCAjw_Y_8BRBiEiwA5MCBJgz0i4HKVr9k1S4NLRkScaueHxJ5gECZPKsDNsYxTEnPYR3Z_C6-xxoCbE4QAvD_BwE%3AG%3As&cvosrc=cse.google.CANAD30182&cvo_campaign=SB_Google_USD&gclid=CjwKCAjw_Y_8BRBiEiwA5MCBJgz0i4HKVr9k1S4NLRkScaueHxJ5gECZPKsDNsYxTEnPYR3Z_C6-xxoCbE4QAvD_BwE)).  - [Sosken Studios](https://soskenstudios.com/collections/coats-jackets) - Winter coats and style are hard to reconcile, but leave it once again to the Canadians! (you thought Sosken with the ‚ÄúO‚Äù was Scandinavian brand didn‚Äôt you? So did I). My favorite thing about them is that they sell slim/thin/lightweight puffers that are designed to go under their existing stylish coats. I have their [Ghia](https://soskenstudios.com/collections/light-puffers/products/ghia-sand-lightweight-down-jacket) and it‚Äôs a godsend for extending my fashionable wool coat wear  - [Soia & Kyo](https://www.soiakyo.com/) - they have their fair share of beautiful fall coats, but their down winter ones also have a pleasing tailored waist. Like Sosken, you can layer their lighter puffers. Some of their wool coats have [puffer built in](https://www.soiakyo.com/us/en/evette-classic-wool-coat-with-quilted-puffer-lining/EVETTE-C.html), which we can all agree is a rare and precious thing. **Note:** Neither Sosken or Soia & Kyo will keep you toasty like a Moncler or Canada Goose type down thing for the arctic, but they are perfect for bridging that gap between ‚Äústylish wool car coat‚Äù and ‚ÄúMichelin Man Snowsuit‚Äù weather.  - [Icebreaker thermals](https://www.icebreaker.com/en-us/womens-baselayers) - I hate spending money on thermals, and [Uniqlo‚Äôs Heattech line](https://www.uniqlo.com/us/en/women/heattech) is honestly good enough for almost everything. And then my husband took me ice fishing in Northern Minnesota and I spent the whole time wondering whether merely agreeing to go on the trip or marrying him in general was a terrible life decision but what was definitely not a terrible life decision was picking up some of these. They are the REAL DEAL for cold weather active wear and frequently much less expensive at sporting/outdoor stores, especially if you don‚Äôt care about things like color (which, honestly, they are thermals).  - [Wolford Merino Tights](https://www.wolfordshop.com/hosiery/tights/merino-tights/11310.html?nsctrid=v02_us_g_g_263083883451_&gclid=CjwKCAjw_Y_8BRBiEiwA5MCBJr3A0QTZPlipwI6nv57PtVz6mzSGvTjvESFkP05l4PjzKWhBS51NOBoCuPMQAvD_BwE) - like thermals, I hate spending money on tights. I ordered these black ones at $40 a piece from some European online sock store and hated every moment of it. Now it‚Äôs 3 years later and I am glad I spent the money. They are warm, slightly translucent so not frumpy like completely opaque tights can be, and unlike smartwool, they do not have the white ‚ÄúSmartwool‚Äù logo above the toe line so you can actually wear these with normal pumps in transitional weather. They also pilled less than smartwool. They are the only reason why I can continue to wear dresses and skirts to the office in the winter.  - [Love your melon](https://loveyourmelon.com/) - purveyors of the basic white girl beanie pom hats, or ‚Äútoques.‚Äù What I like about them is that they are thick knit and almost universally flattering. I have a huge head and typically beanies fit me like a condom but this one retains that slightly oversized effortlessly cozy look. Also 100% made in USA and Canada and 50% of their profits are donated to child cancer research. I have the speckled one and I love it.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 27, 2020	labels:How much should I expect to pay for a perfectly fitting dress shirt, made in USA or Italy?
text:For bespoke in the US, you are probably looking at > $300 a shirt.  Realize that many shirt makers have a minimum initial order of 4 or more shirts. This is because the time to measure you, and potentially make up a toile fitting shirt has a lot of overhead that cannot be covered by one shirt. This is different from the world of bespoke suits because a bespoke suit is typically US$3k+  For made to measure, you are probably looking at US$150+. Fabric costs weigh heavily in this - it is not inconceivable to have a $250+ MTM shirt.  Italian prices vary widely because some Italians come to the US, and therefore their US pricing needs to cover their travel costs and other overhead. Italian prices in Italy will typically be cheaper than in the US.	labels:	episode_done:True

I can't speak to this specific shirt, but if I was looking...I'd buy it.	labels:Based on the reviews and your experience the quality seems decent, but I'm wary of buying chinese clothing due to sizing issues. I bought a jacket from Bronson MFG and while the sleeves and body length were fine, the shoulders and chest felt tight.  If I'd gone a size up the sleeves and body length would have been too long even though the rest would have likely fit. I might have a similar issue here based on the shoulder measurements. In this case, the W40/medium seems to fit everywhere except the shoulders which at 45cm/16.7in seems awfully small for a medium. Even the W42/large shoulder length at 45cm/17.7in seems small. However, in the past I bought items that had similar measurements for shoulder size yet fit me nicely so it could turn out like that.

I always look at things and think have I wore this in a while does it do anything for me do I feel good in it? After you‚Äôve picked your things, sell them or even charity shop! If you feel like your now limited maybe get key pieces in to make your wardrobe collection a whole rounder. I find it easy to have good staples, like knit wear, t shirts, dresses you can wear casual or formal, then my rain jackets or fancy jackets etc. If you have a basic colour story also like jeans or trousers or skirts, highlighted with prints or thick jumpers it‚Äôs good to have neutrals and highlights of colour I feel. Therefore when it comes to picking an outfit you‚Äôre not overwhelmed by colour, or the lack of colour. Hope this helps!	episode_done:True

Going off what I can see on the site they have some good sustainability goals and production standards they adhere to. I prefer a drawstring on the inside so I liked the Sunspel/Lulu pants for that reason. They advertise them as soft even though they're polyester so I imagine they're probably a brush back on the interior? Also looks like they don't have a gusset which can be nice for comfort/stretch on tighter pants (but not a requirement).  Do you know where they're made?	labels:Last I checked I think they were Vietnam; they're suuuper soft (in a good way) and I was surprised that I ended up wearing them more often than my Nike Tech Fleece or RC Midweights just because they're that much softer.

text:The best plain t-shirt video guide ‚Äî 11 t-shirts bought and tested	labels:As someone that's addicted to white t-shirts and has spent many hundreds of dollars chasing the perfect look/fit,  I'll add my $0.02.      The only shirt in this video worth your time is the Asket, but even that would rank somewhere around 4th or 5th best.      JCrew makes the best white tee in the game, regardless of price, and it's thankfully cheap. With or without a pocket, the gsent dyed slub tee fits amazing and can take a wash and machine dry - most tee's can't.      Next up would be Bonobos. Also relatively inexpensive (if looking at Sunspel as your guide) and the slim fit works very well. Holds up to a wash, no bacon bullshit going on with the neck, and definitely no shrinkage.      Third I'd go straight to Alex Mill, assuming you hang dry. I've found Slub tees have the best look (personal opinion) so the white slub tee is my choice. DOES NOT hold up to machine drying, so don't be surprised when you pull out a shrunken length baby tee with an Alex Mill logo .     Fourth I'm going to Todd Snyder, but seriously, fuck his prices.      Fifth I'll give this to Asket because of what is said in this video. Personally, I dislike the long ass sleeves. If you want a more fitted athletic look, size down and roll up the sleeves. Otherwise you'll look like a nerd wearing an oversided t-shirt from the 90's. A nice looking t-shirt, but you get the point.      Sixth, toss up between Buck Mason and Wellen. See, I love the Wellen, but it's a different fabric (Hemp I believe) and offwhite, not a true white. The Buck Mason has a curved hem which is really love it or hate it. The downside, even if you love it, is that if you machine dry - instant baby tee. The Wellen doesn't have this problem.      Seventh I'm taking Taylor Stitch Heavybag Tee. It's really more offwhite than white, and it's...um...heavy. It feels like you took a carhartt jacket and cut the fucking sleeves off and called it good. I don't mind it. It's just not a "classic". Holds up to machine wash/dry really well, and fits great.      I have yet to try Sunspel, 316, Lady White (did they just stop making the Clark?) and Reigning Champ.      On order and soon to arrive is the Reigning Champ, which if it's anything like the hoodies will probably take #1 (no pressure, right?) - otherwise, I'm sticking to my list. Regardless of $$$ the JCrew garment dyed slub is the perfect white tee. Hands down.  EDIT: I had to change pima to Garment Dyed. I get shirt material name's mixed up often and just checked the tag. Which also reminds me, the BR pima is a fantastic option as well, just don't machine dry. I'd place that right around 4th with Todd Snyder for the way it fits when new.
text:Where does Kirkland land?	labels:Somewhere in the hanes beefy tee category. Don't get me wrong, I grew up wearing hanes. They did the job, but ultimately when you go upmarket you realize it typically comes with a better fit and better materials.   Kirkland IMO have a sloppy look. I'm a huge fan of thinner collars. I'd buy a mock turtleneck if I wanted that look, right?   In a pinch, I'd still wear a Kirkland. I won't trash them, just want to stress there are far more flattering options.	episode_done:True
text:BoF: J. Crew's New CEO has a Survival Plan: Edit out the Ugly	labels:I just bought a leopard print swing dress from them - because I apparently have a leopard problem and it spoke to my soul.  I still consider the brand because they have tall sizes, but my most recent purchase doesn't really feel very J. Crew. I think I'd shop with them more regularly if they bothered to do more than hem the clothes longer and actually move the shoulder, elbow, and knee placements for tall clothes. Not every tall person is a stretched out, narrow human like Jenna Lyons. I think style-wise, they don't feel consistent at the moment and like they don't have a distinct identity (like the leopard dress). The quality is also all over the place and doesn't really fit the (full) price they ask for for non-suiting. They have basics and staples, but I can't consistently turn to them for much beyond that.  Edited to add, if the women's part of the store would bring it the way the men's side of the house does, I'd probably only wear J. Crew because the men's store is chef's kiss. Consistent, good quality, and recognizable style.

The thing I struggle with most is what kind of shoes to pair it with, but I'd love whole outfit suggestions, too.
text:I don't know how to style for women, but I imagine any type of sleek black boot with a higher shaft, or strappy black heels would look good.  Grey or white would probably work too depending on the rest of the outfit.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Just singing the praises of wool	labels:For hiking and winter sports, very little can beat wool. Synthetics are better for more "luxury" sports where you're unlikely to get lost or be in danger, like downhill skiing.  But for hiking, snowshoeing, and cross country skiing, wool can be a life saver.  Literally.
text:The only thing about wool is that it takes forever to dry, which is a problem for me since I live on the West Coast. But it's fantastic for sunny day trips.	labels:True, but it still keeps you warm, even when wet. If you fall into a frozen river while wearing wool, your chances of making it back to camp/a road/your fire go up significantly, compared to cotton or synthetics.	episode_done:True

text:What are your thoughts on outfit repeating multiple days in a row?	labels:I've always worn pants twice before washing.  Due to covid, I only have in person stuff twice a week, and only need to wear work clothes for 1.5 hours at a time, so I'm only wearing 1 work outfit a week (I only dress up for work when I'm working outside the house).  When I was working outside the house, I never rewire shirts, though. That's because my job is pretty physical (violin teacher), though. No need to go to work smelling like day-old BO.  If I was seeing the same people, I would make sure to change the outfit. My mom always told me if I didn't people would think I was dirty, and I'm afraid she's right. I doubt I would notice/remember if other people were wearing the same thing as the day before, though.	episode_done:True
text:Ever been censored at work because of what you wear?	labels:Yup! I have to wear white in the acupuncture clinic and didn't have a good mirror or time in the morning. So when I arrived my teacher looked at me in awe and gave me a doctor's coat. And that was so funny because she never judges but she got a bit stressed there. I only then understood my clothes was waaay to sexy. Like something I would never wear . Seetrue wide masked sweater , with singlet under and bare skin in big holes around the neck and white thights  showing cellulite. So this was just a good censorship, embarrassing and funny.	episode_done:True
text:What trousers do people wear these days?	labels:I'm struggling to find pants for work in a traditional business casual.office. it seems like everything is cropped (brr!!) and I'm not into overly baggy.

A few years later I got an actual Marc Jacobs purse and wallet on sale, which was arguably expensive but didn‚Äôt feel like an extravagant purchase necessarily. I think my LV wallet is probably what I would consider my ‚Äúexpensive‚Äù purchase but it is all so relative.	episode_done:True
text:People with an over the top personal style, how do you incorporate it into your day to day?	labels:Alternative clothing salesperson here: COMMIT. Nothing is worse than half-assing over the top styles. Also make sure it‚Äôs cohesive. I have a lot of different styles - punk, goth, witchy, lolita - in my closet, make sure your whole outfit is cohesive and has a ‚Äústory‚Äù. Similar colours, fabrics, or moods. Make sure your hair and makeup match too.  Not to say that like, alt clothing people spring from the ground fully formed, obviously everyone takes time to build a wardrobe and that‚Äôs okay too! But imo to really shine it takes a bit more
text:Ugh this is something I'm very self conscious about, I wear alt clothing every day but I only wear makeup 2-3 times per year because I absolutely cannot stand the way it feels. I don't think I look bad when I look in the mirror but I secretly worry that everyone else thinks I look like an idiot.	labels:No disrespect to u/blackninjakitty because I don‚Äôt think this was their point, but screw anyone who makes you feel like you need to wear makeup to feel put together. This might mean that the person you are blaring this message at most frequently is yourself. You get to be the arbiter of the image you present to the world. To paraphrase u/TheSSChallenger, people who care about if/how much/what style/what frequency you wear makeup aren‚Äôt the kind of people whose opinions matter.    Simply put, makeup is one tool among many others that you can use to express yourself. But the most important thing is that you are being true to yourself and not going through performative actions you don‚Äôt derive joy from.	episode_done:True
text:what are wardrobe items you own that you absolutely recommend to everyone else here?	labels:Wings + Horns slub tee/henley. I've worn a few almost everyday for 5-6 years now and there are no signs of it ever deteriorating. Truly a r/buyitforlife they are quite pricey but they're fucking amazing quality.    Wings + Horns or Reigning Champ tiger fleece hoodie. Indestructible material, texture looks great. Nothing fancy, but looks great on it's own with just jeans.   Uniqlo jeans. Amazing quality for its price. I've now own two of the same black jeans and I wear them almost everyday   Uniqlo basic tees. After W+H these are what I wear. Super simple but lasts long for its price and fits great. Soft material.   Engineered Garments wool cinch vest. Very flexible. Can be worn over a long sleeve tee, sweater or even a hoodie. Great for layering   Wings + Horns flannel. Bought a zip flannel from them back in 2010? I'm only getting rid of it now because the sleeves have finally ripped.

text:Maternity clothes can also be resold if they‚Äôre solid quality. There‚Äôs always going to be a market for them! Hence, it‚Äôs also good to look for them second hand. It does make a big difference to your comfort levels to wear things that are cut for a pregnant body.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What is your one clothing item that makes your life better that everyone should have?	labels:Comfortable leather loafers. They can go with everything. I got a pair from [Naturalizer](https://www.naturalizer.com/product/womens-libby-3020186/black-leather-ec0213601). They didn't require breaking in, and they were even more comfortable after I re-soled them with a thicker sole.  I feel super professional when I carry my black leather tote ([by Kate Spade](https://www.katespade.com/products/molly-large-work-tote/767883349205.html)) around. I dislike wearing a bagpack to carry around a laptop or papers because I find it immediately makes my look casual. So this is a good solution. It's easy to pair with outfits too.
text:Naturalizer has the BEST leather flats/loafers. I like them so much I bought a backup pair of my favourite style when it was on sale (Emiline in beige).

text:What‚Äôs your everyday purse?	labels:I have three - I do tend to switch them out with each other but my criteria is really that they hold phone+keys+wallet+bag of miscellaneous things(lip products, mirror, tide to go, mints, sanitizer, etc). Two of them also hold a waterbottle and umbrella or book which is a plus depending on what I‚Äôm doing. I like my bags to be pretty mid sized so they hold what I need but don‚Äôt look bulky/ginormous. What I wear is really dependent on the day/what else I‚Äôm wearing though.    [Opelle Baby Ballet](https://opellecreative.com/collections/permanent-collection/products/baby-ballet-2) - this one is my only black one. It‚Äôs for more of a slouchy vibe and is my least structure bag.

[Sophie Hulme Straw Bag](https://www.matchesfashion.com/us/products/Sophie-Hulme-Straw-medium-leather-cross-body-bag-1182386) - this is my smaller everyday bag.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 04, 2021	labels:Need help with Levi's jeans.   Thanks to anyone taking the time to read this.   I'm a fan of Levi's jeans and was planning to buy a few more pairs. I normally wear 501 original fit jeans. I found with them I typically wear 32(waist)/32(length) for the best fit. Leaves me a bit of room in the waist which I like, and there's just enough extra length at the ends to get the baggy look that I go for. Normally I wear 30/32-34 in any other jeans. But with my 501's I wear them at a consistent 32/32.   I was curious about getting a pair of loose fit dark wash carpenter jeans. Never bought a pair before and with the whole pandemic thing going on I'm having to get used to online shopping.   Wanted to know if anyone out there had any insight on figuring out what size would be best for those jeans?   Do they fit small? Big? Long? Short? My frame of reference is the 501 original fit. If anyone knows how they fit in comparison that would help a lot.   Here's the jeans I'm interested in https://www.levi.com/CA/en_CA/clothing/men/jeans/stay-loose-carpenter-cottonized-hemp-mens-jeans/p/558490005   Appreciate anyone's help.

text:Haha you mean a lot of ankles showing? I know it makes little sense in winter but it gives it a slightly more tailored look which seems pretty popular now	labels:I think that depends on body type though (and honestly, quite a few other variables). I feel like if you're tall, rolling your trousers up past the ankles just makes you look like you couldn't find trousers long enough for your legs.  I can see it working on a shorter man, better than having that bunched up fabric at the ankles, but even then I wouldn't take it to extremes.  This is another example of why say don't *religiously* follow trends, wear what compliments *you* the most. Personally I would never wear hugely oversized clothing because I'm 5'5 and I don't want to look 3'5 (speaking generally, because tbh many of these jackets posted here aren't so comically huge, most of them look normal to me and I'd absolutely wear some of them).	episode_done:True

text:Technical/Labwear but make it fashion	labels:This is something I think about a lot!!! I think the overlap between science and fashion is one that is chronically overlooked  (and even looked down upon) because caring about clothes, makeup, and appearance is considered stereotypically feminine, vapid, and unintelligent, which doesn't fit with people's preconceived notions of what a scientist should be. I actually just started an instagram for my OOTDs specifically to show how I dress for lab vs for life because I wanted to give some visibility to the idea of fashion/aesthetics and STEM coexisting. Your post title actually made me laugh bc I called my instagram  sciencebutmakeitfashion ( if you're interested in seeing any example outfits).  I work in a biology lab, so not quite as strict as chemistry lab when it comes to PPE,  but I feel like I'm still able to express myself through my outfits. I'm a research assistant in an academic environment, so I think I also have more flexibility with my wardrobe in that respect.  Overall, I feel like my style choices are pretty consistent on work and non-work days besides open toed shoes and garment length (though I will wear shorts or longer skirts/dresses to work and throw a lab coat on overtop). I'm really into vintage fashion and secondhand shopping, so my clothing style is based on whatever fun or interesting pieces I find when I'm thrifting. A lot of vintage pieces are a bit thicker and more durable as well, because they were made to last.
text:>I think the overlap between science and fashion is one that is chronically overlooked  This is such an important part of the conversation! I am very feminine and I'm sick of people shitting on science stuff that's targeted to girls that includes feminine branding (glitter, pink, etc ). I love that stuff and I would have been so jazzed as a kid had I felt science could be girly. (I know girls don't need this to get into science but inclusive marketing like this is important for all kids)  I've found myself having to make decisions when presenting at conferences on how feminine dressing I can get away with while still being taken seriously. Times are changing but this is still and issue. I wish I could feel more creative freedom in how I present myself in science.	labels:As someone who's worked in several lab environments and academic/research group, my answer has become "It depends."   If I'm doing bench work, fuck it. Jeans and a crappy t-shirt because I will invariably get some spatter on my shirt that causes holes in the wash, and I'm tired of losing shirts this way.  Also, if I'm doing benchwork, OSHA has some pretty strong opinions on what I can and cannot wear. Think fully covered legs, closed toe shoes, and any cute shirt I am wearing gets hidden under a lab coat. If I am lucky, I am around when they order lab coats and can order an x-small, so it has a semi-fitted cut on me. Otherwise, all other lab coats make me look like I got dressed for bring your daughter to work day with huge sleeves and boxy cuts. It's pretty awful, but so are acid burns. I will spend the time walking to the lab, lunch, and time walking out of lab in clothes that are visible to the public, which is usually less than an hour of my day. Not worth my time getting fancy for that little amount of time in a work day.  For the times I am actually interacting with other humans, aka not near a lab bench, my go to outfits include oxford shirt dresses and blazers, with ballet flats. Current love is an express shirt dress in burgundy with rose floral blazer, black ballet flats. Knee length skirts with fun details like kick pleats in the hem so they have movement when I walk, or plaids in curvy cuts. I love a plaid trumpet-style skirt or half-circle skirt. I will rock the high end call girl/librarian look all day every day. Think knee length pencil skirt in houndstooth, black turtleneck with lace collar and sleeves, cardigan or grey blazer, knee high black boots. Pair with statement earrings. It's a fun outfit.  Lots of fitted oxfords, my boobs are small enough that I can wear button downs. Fun earrings, I tend to favor art nouveau style jewelery.  Blazers in fabrics and colors that are unexpected. Denim blazer is a staple in my closet. I have an Issac Mizrahi knit blazer in a burgundy and cream floral print that I love. A good trench coat, with a flared skirt. For me, having a great work wardrobe meant picking my favorite color groups so things coordinate easily. I favor black, grey, white, purple, and reds.  In Covid-19 world? If I'm on a zoom call, I will get dressed from the waist up. If no one sees me, I'll run my reports in my PJs.	episode_done:True

text:What are some differences between stereotypical Millennial and Gen Z fashion/aesthetics?	labels:I associate Gen Z fashion with crop tops and sweatpants, so yeah it makes sense that people in their 30's buying expensive ethical clothes aren't going for the sporty spice look.
text:Totally.  To me, Gen Z is a lot of clothing that isn‚Äôt work appropriate but super fun. A lot of crop tops, bra tops, spaghetti straps, usually some tummy showing, and then some baggy pants. Lots of thrifting and also cheap fast fashion. Doc Martens and other platform shoes. Very 90s/early 2000s. Long acrylic nails, false lashes. Really fun and can be a really ‚Äúhot but trashy‚Äù style   Millennial fashion is more professional/better quality/structured. Linens, trousers, heels, sandals, etc. Frankly I think it has to do with millennials having more money. Low key hair, nails and makeup. Neutral colours and patterns. It‚Äôs a more mature style   I‚Äôm 25 so I get to do both üòé woohoo	labels:I am a completely broke, jobless 24 year old and recent graduate and I have recently adopted a more mature style because I don't want to be jobless forever.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 28, 2020	labels:How important is matching my watch strap to my belt and shoes? I always wear high-quality leather shoes and matching belts. Often matching textures as well as colors. I‚Äôm very anal about that. I just got a Hamilton to replace my FitBit, but I plan on using it as my only watch. Not looking to shell out for different watches for different outfits... I opted for a medium brown strap with a black face. Seemed like the most versatile option. Looks fine with my brown footwear (all shades) and even seems okay with my black footwear since my two black boots have brown midsoles (Axe Breakers and Lofgren Chukkas). Not sure what to do when I wear burgundy... I have some black oxfords I probably won‚Äôt wear this with.   So... Am I committing any glaring faux pauxs here based on what I‚Äôve said? Can I get away with this when I wear burgundy shoes/belt? Should I learn to switch the bands and do that regularly for different outfits? Is anyone even gonna care in the slightest?  I generally wear nice denim. I‚Äôm a high school teacher in California, so ain‚Äôt no dress code.

text:FAQ: How do I pick out my first suit for professional internships, interviews, etc.?	labels:I think the advice for "what to wear for job interviews" has changed a *lot* since the sub started. Increasingly suits aren't even a good idea in a lot of industries and you'll be over dressed.  Further, the advice from before was often to get "one good suit" and to spend a lot of money at Suit Supply or similar.   I think for a lot of people, suits will be so infrequently needed that spending $400 on a suit is most likely over kill. Especially if you're a student and on a budget.  Read the guides on how a suit should fit, a lot of that hasn't changed too much. Then go somewhere where you can try the garments on in person (writing this for if/when COVID ends) and go from there. I find it weird to recommend to beginners to try and order a suit online without seeing how the garment fits on you first or spending more than around $200 if it's something you'll need maybe twice a year for the career fairs.  Get something in a basic navy or charcoal, brown dress shoes, a white dress shirt, and a basic grenadine tie to go with it. Easy.
text:I was going to post something like this.  Very workplace/industry dependent.  If possible, reach out to someone at that company in that team or department.  When interviewing for my last position, I was instructed very plainly to NOT wear a tie.  Director doesn't want to see extremely formal interview attire.  If you wear a suit at all at my workplace, (when we actually went into the office), I would assume you are in sales or something that is customer facing.  Everyone else dresses extremely casually.  All that being said-buy a grey or navy pinstripe suit if you are not going to a funeral.	labels:> All that being said-buy a grey or navy pinstripe suit if you are not going to a funeral.  A pinstripe suit says to me you're either trying to be Mad Men, or you're an East Coast rich kid; even among suit occasions they're *extremely* rare in my experience in California (and also in movies, tv, etc) so I would definitely not recommend that as a general rule.	episode_done:True

text:People with an over the top personal style, how do you incorporate it into your day to day?	labels:I love loud colors, interesting textures, and fun prints. I realized around this time last year that none of my clothes go together, so I started acquiring basics. Plain tees, turtlenecks, tanks, and bodysuits; plain boots, plain blue and black jeans, etc. Mostly black basics because black is still a really dramatic color even if the item is plain. I can still wear statement pieces, but they look better and stand out more because they‚Äôre not competing or clashing with anything else. If I‚Äôm wearing a great jacket, fun pants, and fabulous shoes, which are you going to pay most attention to? If I‚Äôm wearing just a great jacket, or just fun pants, or just fabulous shoes, then my favorite statement pieces get to shine front and center. I feel like my outfits have actually become less plain and more standout now that I have basics to base them on.

I am indeed a fool because protectant spray is no match for indigo dye rubbing off of your jeans onto said handbag. (Yes, the jeans had been prewashed before wearing.) I tried everything in my extensive laundry/shoe care arsenal to get the stains out, with absolutely no luck. Disaster # 2 entailed a violent confrontation between a sidewalk grate and the leather-wrapped heel of my knee-high black AGL boots.

text:How to avoid looking older with your clothing??	labels:I looove this aesthetic, it's my actual workwear, and funnily enough I dress this way because it does make me look older.  To stay age appropriate, the key is accessories. Socks that fit the aesthetic but are more playful, bows are great, and fun jewelry. There are so many looks, like plaid skirts, that I like but would never wear because they're better for a younger look. Also, if you don't already look older than your age it's probably not going to be a problem. If it does have that effect, it's not in an inappropriate way so it really doesn't matter.	episode_done:True
text:Women with ADHD & Sensory Processing Disorder: I need Clothing recs!	labels:Hi! I am one of those people who "grew out" of ADHD, which basically means I have high functioning ADHD that I can deal with enough to not be on stimulants, but the clothing issue is so real!  I am so lucky that I work in a pretty casual environment, so I can wear pretty much whatever I want. This is what I have found works for me, but I realize it might not work for everyone:  Tops: I wear solid color crew neck, mock neck, or quarter zip/button fleece/modal/sherpa sweatshirts in the winter (Minnesota is cold). Having pockets is a big plus. Hoodies annoy me, unless I am wearing the hood, so I only really tolerate it on outerwear. In the summer, I mostly wear tank tops or soft tee shirts. I am really picky with tee shirts, and I can not describe what my criteria is. I hate it when my sleeves bunch up when I put anything on over a tee shirt, so I wear sweatshirts or long-sleeve shirts if the weather is borderline and everyone thinks I am insane.  Bottoms: I am team leggings are pants. I pretty much exclusively wear leggings, joggers, or athletic pants of some type.  Shoes: sneakers or sandals that aren't flip flops. Maybe ankle boots or comfy flats. I kind of hate socks until it is cold out, and then I wear soft socks.  Underwear: tank tops with built in bras that are seamless exist, and they are amazing. Or I wear bralettes or sports bras. I think I have 1 normal bra, and it doesn't fit. I really like seamless thongs for underwear. Since I'm team leggings are pants, I don't want underwear lines or any bunching.  Masks: I really like the Athleta masks with the pocket for a filter. I feel like they stay in place and are pretty breathable, despite having 2 layers and a filter. I just got a Lululemon mask in the mail, and although they are single layer, they seem really protective. I like masks that contour to your face and don't have the gaps on the side, because it makes me feel like it is blocking the corona from getting out and in. I'm excited for the Lululemon mask, because it doesn't go around your ears, and my ears are getting irritated.  As you can see, I basically dress like a child, but you can find pretty and flattering cuts and details that make your outfits show your personality while still being comfy.   I mostly shop at Lululemon for my staples, CRZ Yoga and Aerie when I don't want to pay for Lululemon, and Target when I want to impulse buy everything that is soft and pretty. I have some seamless leggings from Zara on the way that I am really excited for. Lululemon really makes flattering, durable, comfortable leggings that look nice and are not see-through. I also like their socks, underwear, joggers, tanks, and sports bras. I feel like most of their sweatshirts aren't worth shelling out money for, so I usually get sweatshirts from Target, Aerie, and Columbia.	episode_done:True

I saved about $278 CAD from buying it from him. Was risky, but I looked at the scarf in the burberry store prior and it checked out.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- October 26	labels:My J.Crew 484 chinos stretch throughout the day - should I get them tailored?  They fit perfectly right out of the wash - no belt needed. After a day or so of wearing they are noticeably looser - I'd say roughly 1". I would struggle without a belt, and they crease slightly near the fly when I tighten the belt up, which is annoying.  Is it worth getting them taken in 1/2" - 1" such that they are very tight out of the wash, but fit snugly when "stretched", or does this risk ruining their shape?  Many thanks.
text:they're going to stretch regardless, and i wouldn't recommend getting  them taken in to the point where they're "very tight"- doesn't sound comfortable or like it would look good. a bit of stretching throughout the day is to be expected	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Style rut: Pinterest vs reality	labels:my big tip is: colour   do you like a certain colour in all these clothes? incorporate that into your wardrobe. i recently realised that my pinterest boards have a lot of neutrals, which I didn't have. I've been thrifting a lot lately, and have bought a dress, two shirts, a skirt, a scarf and heels that are neutral shades. they're much easier to incorporate into my everyday wardrobe, since I have a lot of black and white clothes.       second tip is: the cut!  a lot of clothes look like shit on me because the cut is all wrong. buying jeans that fit me vs. forcing myself into trendy jeans that look like i was squeezed into them like a sausage makes a massive difference. i always try things that i want to buy and REALLY ask myself: do i actually look alright in this? it's heartbreaking when you buy something that's cute, but you just don't think that the sleeves work that well on you.	episode_done:True
text:I love all the new leather clothes this fall, what have you bought?	labels:Since it doesn‚Äôt get very cold here, I picked up a Madewell denim jacket from their recent 30% off purchase sale, and 2 Patagonia W Better Sweaters for 50% off (I believe they‚Äôre still on sale in case anyone is interested - although it‚Äôs only for the grey, black, and navy varieties).	episode_done:True

text:Boba's Ultra Basic Steps For Developing Style and Outfits (version 1)	labels:I've taken a couple of laps before writing this comment, but up-front I think aesthetics section should be split, because I think the most basic question, which is answered aesthetically but not functionally, is what do you want your clothes to **do**? Giving off a vibe is mentioned, but there's an even more functional level of "are these clothes sensible for how I live my life?" Are you buying lots of hawaiian shirts even though live at the north pole, or buying down parkas when you live in Hawaii? Do you regularly find yourself cold and wet because you don't own any raincoats, or find that your fishnet sleeves keep getting caught on the mill in the machine shop, or that your raw denim really doesn't give you the flexibility you need to dance?   I think what the clothes do should meet you where you do what you do, and at the most basic level that's physically enabling you to do things, and you can build a vibe from that.
text:I totally see where you‚Äôre coming from. I slipped in some of functionality in the Materials section because I feel newcomers should be giving complete aesthetic freedom because a freely developed aesthetic can be applied in practical selections of raincoats, etc but I hope people read your perspective as well and take what they need to and I‚Äôll think of ways to develop that more in the next round of Boba‚Äôs homework assignments lol :)	labels:Yeah, I didn't want to come in too hot and I think you've put together a really comprehensive list of jumping off points, I just know that in my personal experience I've had pieces that I could answer definitively for every question and I liked, but just didn't work for how I lived my life in them. Or worse, how I imagined I would when I bought it, pretending it would somehow change me as a person or update habits. If anything, it's one of the most common mistakes to pop up on MFA because it's either too simple to ask or the aspirational element is too powerful a motivator.	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 25, 2020	labels:Boots!  I'm in an urban area (mid-Atlantic, US East Coast) where, in the winter, I walk through medium amounts of rain/wet leaves/slush/rivets on paved walks. With all the boot megathreads on this sub, I'm sure I've missed the answer to this, but what do you all like to do for waterproof/water resistant shoes?   I'm looking for daily wear shoes that do not look like hiking boots (I have those), but work like lightweight/slim hiking boots. Low tops are also okay if you really like them. I am jealous of a lot of women's boots that looks relatively warm and good for wet winters while still being stylish urban wear. Priorities are comfort and reasonable upkeep time and costs for something you'd wear 5 days a week. Ideal budget would be under $200 but flexible.

text:What was your first 'expensive' fashion purchase?	labels:The first one that felt like a big deal to me was a gray trenchcoat from the Gap. I always loved how classy a fitted gray trenchcoat looked, but I don't live in an area where I can use a coat like that too often so it wasn't a practical thing I needed. When I could afford one, knowing that it would be something I only use a little during the year, it felt very special to me.

text:Do you like them? I want to pick up some above the knee mesh shorts but don‚Äôt know which brands to look for	labels:I bought one pair shortly after quarantine started and quickly bought two more. I pretty much lived in them before winter hit. I went for the no-pocket shorties. They leave too little to the imagination to really wear outside the house, but they're my favorite around the house shorts.	episode_done:True
text:How has the quality changed over the years at some of your fav brands?	labels:I feel like Abercrombie and Fitch has turned around! I love all the dresses I've bought from them - almost all have been lined and a lot of them have pockets! I'm so pleased.
text:Abercrombie and Fitch had solid quality clothing when they first started out. Then it got bad somewhere after 2010 where I wouldn't even buy from there.  Now with the rebrand in recent years, they've opted to use better fabric and materials so I think the quality is a lot higher than it was a few years ago but still not at the level they were when the brand debuted.  I honestly miss Ruehl 925, which was their brand targeted towards young adults, and I think the new Abercrombie is more similar to that.	labels:What do you consider when they first started out? Like when they were making camping equipment and outdoor clothing? Or do you mean the early 2000‚Äôs? Because their quality was awful during their peak popularity years because they knew they could get away with it. The tees were thin to start with so they pilled easily. Same with denim, it was already distressed. And Hollister was worse.	episode_done:True

If you‚Äôre going anywhere, you‚Äôll already be seen in your avoiding-the-virus gear, just like everyone else, so how much room does anyone really have to give anyone else grief for what they‚Äôre wearing? I say the heck with it. Go all the way. Be comfortable now; if you want, you can be fancy later when things are closer to normal.	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 27, 2020	labels:I‚Äôm 18 years old and I just got my first job (and I need to dress up for it).  The dress code is black slacks or khakis, dress shirt, tie. They provide the rest of the uniform. How many of each do I need for a work week? And good ideas where to find them cheap/comfortable/fast over strictly fashionable since this is just retail.  Also for anyone who‚Äôs had a code like this, how long did it take for you to get use to dressing up? I‚Äôve never super liked wearing a tie, and I‚Äôve always generally been a t shirt guy, so it‚Äôs a big change for.
text:Get black chinos instead instead of slacks. Do they require an actual dress shirt or just a button down?   For me Oxford cloth button downs are more comfortable than dress shirts but YMMV.  Is this a food service job? Sounds like a catering uniform.  I would black get 2 pairs of black chinos and at least 3 button downs to start if you are working full time. If they get stained or heavily worn and require cleaning after every use I‚Äôd get 3 chinos and 5 shirts.   Cheaper the better for this type of stuff:  Gap,  Old Navy, Marshalls TJ Maxx etc. thrifting would be better but time consuming.

text:What's an "outdated" item you still love and wear although the style has fallen out of fashion?	labels:I have quite a few things that are obviously dated, but I try to keep them fresh by pairing with more updated items.

They are [the basket weave pattern](https://poshmark.com/listing/Jeffrey-Campbell-Lita-Heels-Basket-Weave-5e18adb740744a311e647c05?l_con=PREOWNED%2FUSED&&utm_source=gdm&utm_campaign=10421803805&campaign_id=10421803805&ad_partner=google&gskid=pla-957712158674&gcid=445168166808&ggid=103848574992&gdid=m&g_network=g&enable_guest_buy_flow=true&gclid=CjwKCAiApNSABhAlEiwANuR9YBGvffqM1HySSaKWLsMn1bmpAhHA0Zi9RTBz2MdGnIrIpZNuhiptjRoCfj0QAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds), so I feel that makes them at least one step removed from the really popular black and tan ones that were everywhere in 2010. I wear them with baggy tapered paperbag jeans with the cuffs rolled up or with super wide leg culottes, [similar vibes as this](https://images.app.goo.gl/B5AcnssZiXyobGqy9). They will NOT be worn with skater skirts or skinny jeans under any circumstances.  I have [two of these peplum tops](https://images.app.goo.gl/jquQE8MQftZ2yotg8), one in black and one in gray. Peplum is a trend that comes and goes a lot, but I love it. I usually wear them in a tonal or monochrome outfit that includes cropped wide leg pants and platform sneakers. Sometimes I will layer a black heattech turtleneck underneath.  I have a few Ecko pieces from 2002-2006, which is a streetwear brand from the late 90s - early 2000s. This stuff has logos so it is very obviously dated to that era. One item is a waist length red wool duffel jacket with an orange lining. The logo is small and the silhouette is not too out there, so I can just wear it regularly as a statement item. I have a cropped muscle tank with an all-over [rainbow graffiti airbrush print](https://images.app.goo.gl/vLi2A5wsApsYR3hp8) that features the logo and branding very prominently on the back (the whole backside is in shades of blue and purple - I couldn't find a pic). I wear this either with high waisted wide leg jeans or with a pleated midi skirt and hoop earrings to make it look like an intentional throwback.

text:The best plain t-shirt video guide ‚Äî 11 t-shirts bought and tested	labels:As someone that's addicted to white t-shirts and has spent many hundreds of dollars chasing the perfect look/fit,  I'll add my $0.02.      The only shirt in this video worth your time is the Asket, but even that would rank somewhere around 4th or 5th best.      JCrew makes the best white tee in the game, regardless of price, and it's thankfully cheap. With or without a pocket, the gsent dyed slub tee fits amazing and can take a wash and machine dry - most tee's can't.      Next up would be Bonobos. Also relatively inexpensive (if looking at Sunspel as your guide) and the slim fit works very well. Holds up to a wash, no bacon bullshit going on with the neck, and definitely no shrinkage.      Third I'd go straight to Alex Mill, assuming you hang dry. I've found Slub tees have the best look (personal opinion) so the white slub tee is my choice. DOES NOT hold up to machine drying, so don't be surprised when you pull out a shrunken length baby tee with an Alex Mill logo .     Fourth I'm going to Todd Snyder, but seriously, fuck his prices.      Fifth I'll give this to Asket because of what is said in this video. Personally, I dislike the long ass sleeves. If you want a more fitted athletic look, size down and roll up the sleeves. Otherwise you'll look like a nerd wearing an oversided t-shirt from the 90's. A nice looking t-shirt, but you get the point.      Sixth, toss up between Buck Mason and Wellen. See, I love the Wellen, but it's a different fabric (Hemp I believe) and offwhite, not a true white. The Buck Mason has a curved hem which is really love it or hate it. The downside, even if you love it, is that if you machine dry - instant baby tee. The Wellen doesn't have this problem.      Seventh I'm taking Taylor Stitch Heavybag Tee. It's really more offwhite than white, and it's...um...heavy. It feels like you took a carhartt jacket and cut the fucking sleeves off and called it good. I don't mind it. It's just not a "classic". Holds up to machine wash/dry really well, and fits great.      I have yet to try Sunspel, 316, Lady White (did they just stop making the Clark?) and Reigning Champ.      On order and soon to arrive is the Reigning Champ, which if it's anything like the hoodies will probably take #1 (no pressure, right?) - otherwise, I'm sticking to my list. Regardless of $$$ the JCrew garment dyed slub is the perfect white tee. Hands down.  EDIT: I had to change pima to Garment Dyed. I get shirt material name's mixed up often and just checked the tag. Which also reminds me, the BR pima is a fantastic option as well, just don't machine dry. I'd place that right around 4th with Todd Snyder for the way it fits when new.

text:What's the craziest item you've bought during quarantine?	labels:I haven‚Äôt BOUGHT many crazy things, but COVID gave me a chance to embrace my 1890s aesthetic which has surprisingly managed to evolve a lot over a short amount of time. I worked in education in the spring, and so I had live classes only twice a week, and then was on summer break after that. I started with late 1890s sports wear. Lots of pink/burgundy, gingham, polka dots, seaside aesthetic etc. just your basic B spring fashion, but make it historical.   Now that it‚Äôs fall I think I‚Äôve really embraced my dark academia, giant ass sleeve, professor, suspenders, and cycling trousers self. The nice little silver lining of COVID has definitely been dressing however the fuck I feel like.

text:General Discussion - January 08, 2021	labels:How do yall feel about sneaker fakes? With how exclusive and hard to get nike drops have been lately, I find myself browsing /r/sneakerreps. Especially with how common my foot size is, I dont know if I will ever get a pair of jordans in a desirable colorway without spending $400+.  Not sure if I can personally justify a purchase of something that expensive just because its "hyped"
text:I think... I have a problem with the rep community in general. I see a lot of people that buy fakes so they can pretend to have some social status, but in doing so are feeding into the very same consumerist money = status mindset that made them feel compelled in the first place.   They just want to flex fake Balenciagas runners and Gucci belts so that their friends will think they're well-off enough to afford those things, but in doing so, reinforce the ideas that 1. it's a cool thing to flex like that and 2. you can't have status without ostentatious displays of wealth.   If there was a *stylistic* goal in mind for reps, I have much less of a problem. If you thought [wow, Jeff Goldblum's style here is great and this is something I want to emulate](https://dazedimg-dazedgroup.netdna-ssl.com/593/azure/dazed-prod/1240/6/1246292.jpg), then maybe the rep would be okay, because you're not trying to flex, you're trying to express. But even then, there are a million brands with similar silhouettes available without feeding the rep market that could act as stand-ins for the Balenciagas if you were trying to channel Goldblum's fit.  All that aside, I *really* hate the incentive / access the rep markets / their customers provide for people selling reps as reals. It's happening a lot with Kapital rn, especially as their skeleton pieces are more popular in hype circles. Bunch of drop-shipping assholes popping up on Depop, Grailed, Poshmark, Mercari, and eBay. I don't think I'll personally buy any fakes for fear that it enables shit like this down the line.	labels:This is a well thought-out response. I think this also hits me when drawing lines to brands I enjoy. I don't really care about big fashion names as far as status symbols. But if I were to save up and purchase a Kapital piece down the line, I would be devastated if I had been duped into getting a rep.   Personally I couldn't give a fuck about Nike as a brand or Sneaker reseller profit margins. But I do see how adding fire to the rep market can harm brands that I enjoy even if they aren't directly adjacent to something like Nike.	episode_done:True

text:what pieces/brands did you buy when moving from a warmer climate to a cooler climate? what did you end up regretting/not using?	labels:Oh me! I'm from Southern Europe, moved to the Netherlands and then Sweden, was 100% not prepared. You need:  - lots of thermal base layers. Personally I prefer ones that were relatively low cut so I could rock low cut tops over them. I really cannot how much warmer these made me. My prefered brand is uniqlo, super affordable, very lightweight materials that are somehow really warm  - If you don't have any sweaters, ditch getting everything chunky or loose, as the air gets "in" and makes you cold. Choose tighter sweaters, preferably in natural fabrics like wool, or merino wool if you can afford it. If you still really like loose sweaters, I'd recommend layering them over thermal layers, with a warm jacket to cover up, or you will die.  - Although overcoats are the prettiest, down jackets are the warmest. They are expensive but worthwhile if you intend on staying in a cold place a long time. Im sure they make similar vegan products now, but Id go with sports brands like Fj√§llr√§ven, North Face, Canada Goose, if you are really interested in warmth. In my experience people in seriously cold countries use these kind of jackets over their regular coats, and take them off when they get to work.   - Those hair wraps that are kinda like bandelettes and just cover your ears IMO are a lifesaver. They feel girlier than regular beanies and do a surprisingly good job at keeping your head warm. I literally always have one in my pocket.  - Get thermal tights.	episode_done:True

text:Hedi Slimane‚Äôs CELINE- an idealized look at 1960s rock & roll (large inspiration album)	labels:this is written really nicely! It was slimanes works at SLP that got me into fashion in the first place. The mod stuff from fw14 and surf/skate from ss16 are still one of my favorite shows of all time. I still get inspo from these 2 runways from time to time. People often say slimane's stuff look almost virtually the same every season, and i'm inclined to agree. However, I do think that it's the small meticulous detail that you pay for, and for those that say you find it in vintage, thats somewhat true but you can find exactly what you're looking for that I guess in a way it's always felt like his work was that perfect jacket/shirt you found in vintage thats been turned into a show.  &#x200B;  Speaking more from an asian perspective, despite the influence waning in the euro market, I've never celine being worshipped the way it has been here in asia, especially when they first signed Lisa from blackpink, also their Triomphe bag is selling like hotcakes here.   &#x200B;  I've also seen quite a bit of dislike on the Dancing Kid but I'm not really sure why, I think it looks really nice and it's gives off a different vibe to me. Dancing kid gives me more the vibe of a skater, where it sort of feels like a fuckingawesome + rip n dip without the cat, but I do understand thats more for a younger crowd.   &#x200B;  This 'new'/ slightly altered silhouette he's come out with is alot more wearable for more body types than the old skeleton silhoutte he used to champion but this comes to the point that other designers are already doing it and produce better stuff is certain aspects than him. Maybe I'm a bit biased here, but the other brands who are doing it, emit off another vibe which can't really rival the ones slimane makes.      I liked how you referenced wales bonner, but I feel her aesthetic is more geared towards showing a jamacan+ british (e.g. loverboy from the 80s), while i do agree the images you put there represent the celine look quite well.  &#x200B;  Alot of designers rehash the same thing with minor changes and they dont get much as ire as slimane does. Margiela has rehased the same concepts again and so has CDG.  &#x200B;  and final note, so what if western celebrities wont adapt the new celine? if what's going on has shown us anything, it shows us how little celeb culture actually matters
text:I agree with you on Slimane as an inspiration, I still really appreciate his work and was drawn to it as well. Thank you also for providing the context on markets outside of North America and Europe, you definitely see the marketing and branding appealing more to Asia, and with the brand ambassador appointment are important distinctions from how SLP was marketed.   I'm not sure what you mean by how much or how little celeb culture matters, but I mentioned western celebrities wearing it because of how easily you could see back in the day outfit inspiration from western celebrities in Saint Laurent, and critically, outfits that didn't exclusively feature all one brand. I for one get annoyed with the austere way that product images are done on Celine's website, just the garment itself on a white background. I'd like to see what it looks like worn! Again Western celebs were noted primarily because that's what I see from posters here, but a more diverse perspective is really important on who is wearing what and I'm really glad you mentioned it.   Finally I couldn't agree more on the body- while Slimane's models are still emaciated on the runway, the clothing fits and looks good on a wider array of body types in my view, and I think that's one of the most important changes from SL to Celine, and one of the best ones in my view.	labels:I'll clarify what i mean by celeb culture. I think from like 2014-18 ish, people in the west really worshipped western celebrities and paid way more attention to what they did, for e.g. the kardashians were crazy relevant in those times. I think since 2018 there been much a greater prevalence in korean/asian artists popping up, like blackpink/bts are crazy popular here in the UK.    &#x200B;  I actually agree with you with the product shots, that still really bugs me, alot of designers really like taking a picture of the garm against a stark white back ground, and all them STILL HAVE NO MEASUREMENTS.    &#x200B;  The celebs that supported the hedi slp imo are not as relevant as they were 5 years ago.   e.g.   one direction broke off havent really heard much of them since   and harry evolved into gucci  &#x200B;  i think the other celebs you mentioned are still stuck on vacarello's saint laurent  Maybe I might be a minority here, but I don't really understand why people like vacarello's saint laurent. I find it a bit too 'packaged cool guy' where he just hires the most stereotypically known 'big name  celebs in hollywood to represent the brand, like you can't lump g-eazy and lenny kravitz and travis scott under the same umbrella.  and the rest of it still feels like it's stuck between trying to become a streetwear brand and trying to look	episode_done:True

text:All-time favorite cold weather pieces?	labels:(edited to add another recommendation I had forgotten about)   I have lived in the Northeast my whole life, and I live closer to Canada than to the biggest city in my state. As a fellow winter-hater, these are the products that get me through the 5 month long winters:   Here are the [best slippers](https://www.llbean.com/llb/shop/18664?page=women-s-wicked-good-moccasins&bc=474-630&feat=630-GN1&csp=f&pos=5) money can buy. They're expensive but they're the warmest things ever and will last you a lifetime as long as a dog doesn't chew through them.  You should also invest in a few pairs of [Uniqlo heat tech](https://www.uniqlo.com/us/en/women/heattech) tops and leggings. I own a few of their long sleeves and they're great as base layers in cold, Northeast winters.   Some other winter necessities include a **long, waterproof coat**. It doesn't have to be super expensive, but knee length, waterproof and hooded are musts during the winters to keep the wind from hurting your bones and to keep most of your body covered and dry.   You should also **get mittens instead of gloves**. They're not as great for dexterity when you're fumbling with keys or trying to zip your coat, but they keep your hands so much warmer than gloves do. And for **hats**, just get something that's double layered and machine washable. Lululemon and North Face both sell oversized beanies that are reversible, which are great because you get twice as much fabric around your head. It doesn't need to be wool, it just needs to be chunky.   As for snow boots, I'm currently between pairs, so I don't think I can help you, but even high rain boots become quite warm when you pair them with merino wool socks. The thin ones that are intended to be used for hiking and camping are the best because they are sweat wicking, but you don't have to spend an arm and a leg for wool socks. You can buy cheaper versions on Amazon for 1/4 of the price and they work just as well. They're usually listed as a "wool blend," but that's almost always merino mixed with polyester and they have been very warm in my experience!   Good luck this winter! Stay warm and make sure you dress in layers!	episode_done:True

text:How do you think access and privilege affect your taste and sense of style?	labels:I guess my story is a little different.  I'm trans, and I grew up in a pretty solidly middle-class family (though living a bit beyond our means). I didn't really develop an external sense of style until this year, when I publically came out at 30. And man, it's *hard* to find stuff as a 6'5'' woman with size 13 UK/ size 15 US feet. Finding stuff that fits me, that I can afford, that looks good on me, *and that I want to wear* is a *real*, ***real*** pain.  I'm essentially restricted to just the Tall Range from fast fashion boutiques or tall specialist sites.  For example, outerwear. My friends can buy ¬£20 coats from their local discount store. None of those would look good on me, but they wouldn't even remotely fit either. This year I paid ¬£100 for a belt up black trench coat from a tall specialist. It looks decent but I still had to then pay a tailor ¬£30 to get the arms extended.  So x6 what a shorter friend might pay, and because of the cost it's also the only coat I have, for any weather. I super lucky to get it too, these days the same site only stocks coats which I'd look horrible in. I'm lucky that I also have a really old, thick, winter coat from my time abroad to also wear when it's super cold, but it's so big and bulky that it does nothing for me and I get misgendered in it.  It's kind of worse for shoes. My wearable range is so reduced. I'd love to wear cute, 1930s style shoes or boots, but nobody, *nobody* makes them in my size. I'm restricted to just whatever I can find on the tall specialist site, which isn't bad, but... It's rarely what I WANT to wear, you know?  There's dodgy Chinese sellers who Amazon who claim to be able to make boots in my size, but I have no idea what their quality is like and I can't return them if they're wrong.  I'm actually in contact with a professional boot maker from Mexico at the moment to make a pair of brown, thigh-high, heeled walking boots. The kind of thing you'd be able to get for maybe ¬£30 in a standard shoe shop. It's costing me ¬£250.  I'm lucky that I have a decent financial situation. If I didn't I just wouldn't have the money to look presentable.  TLDR: Fashion is a very expensive, very time consuming hobby for a very tall woman with slightly odd body proportions. And even then you probably won't get anything.	episode_done:True

However, that's way less than $1000, so if I had your budget I'd buy one of these:  - Even nicer boots, though I honestly don't even know what brand because that's so far out of my budget.  - A really nice watch, maybe Shinola or Hamilton.  - A leather jacket, or a luxe version of whatever your favorite style of coat is. My fantasy self would buy a Burberry trench coat, though I think that's more than $1000.

text:Can You Wear a T-Shirt Under a Blazer and Not Look Like an 1980s Leftover?	labels:I still maintain that a t shirt with a tailored jacket is not a good look. It's a clash of formality. Same reason sneakers look odd with a suit. That doesn't mean you can't wear a t shirt or sneakers, just that they don't look good with those particular pairings.

text:Discussion: Clay Jewelry?	labels:I've dabbled in polymer clay myself.  Clay earrings are really fun!  Be careful that you are buying from a reputable source, with very clear photography.  It is really easy to leave fingerprints behind, or for dust/pet fur/debris to get into things.  Like others have said, make sure they are clear about what their metal is made of, and they are sealing them somehow.  What sealant is important, too.  I made a pair of earrings 2 years ago and used a sealant meant for plastics.  Those earrings are still a little tacky to this day!  &#x200B;  tldr: Poly-clay is great.  Do your research before purchasing though.
text:I want to start making my own clay jewelry. Any advice? I‚Äôm totally overwhelmed with information haha	labels:Practice!  My early pieces look so crude next to my more recent stuff.  Invest in good tools so you're touching the clay as little as possible with your hands.  Thinner (to a point) is better.  The outside will cure much faster than the inside.  Keep an eye on the oven when baking, it goes from ready to burned really quickly.	episode_done:True

text:How do I feel sexy at home in winter?	labels:Try going for the more sexy fabrics like lace, satin, silk. And go for solid colours, as opposed to cutesy prints, for example.  Get a lacy/sexy bralette and matching panties set to wear under your lounge clothes.   Wear dressier versions of your loungewear. If you like pajamas, get a matching set of silky pajamas.  If you like wearing sweaters, go for leaner sweaters as opposed to big fuzzy bulky ones.  My favourite dressy lounge outfit for winter is a well-maintained (i.e. not faded) pair of black Victoria's Secret leggings, a black and white striped satiny sleeveless blouse, and a maroon wool-blend sweater vest. So comfy, but dressy enough to have people have over and feel great.
text:I used to date someone who worked for VS and got a 40% discount... even on gift cards so you could damn near get things for free when they had sales... my last pair of VS leggings just got a hole (8 years I‚Äôve had them?)

text: I have been eyeing this bag. Is it functional ? My main concern is things kind of getting jumbled up inside	labels:I guess it depends on what you keep in your bag. My loose items are phone, wallet, keys and sometimes sunglasses, all the smaller things I keep in a pouch that I transfer to whatever bag I currently use.

text:Does anyone else always hesitate to buy what they truly love because they don't have a social life?	labels:I think it's especially bad right now, because of COVID.

I'm going to be able to wear them again someday, so if I really love them, I should keep them even though my home uniform is mostly comfy PJ-type clothes.

For me it's mostly a mental thing - when I get fully dressed up for work, I'm psychologically in work mode.

text:Your thoughts on leopard print (and animal prints in general)	labels:Not a fan of the look unless sometimes when it's grey/black instead of that classic brown/orange color. But I actually do have an umbrella that's more of a simplified pattern and a darker brown color and I like it. I realllly don't like zebra for some reason.   I tried getting more into animal prints a couple years ago, I wanted to be THAT girl, but never really fell in love with them.   I do love snake and I think it suits me the most out of all the animal prints, others overwhelm or clash with my features. But I like it to be in specific colors and so I rarely find snakeprint things that I actually like (only have one pair of sandals and a tank top).   I find the [cow print](https://pin.it/5BhXTrt) adorable, but I don't think I'm cool or daring enough to wear itüòÖ

text:How do you think access and privilege affect your taste and sense of style?	labels:Im an international (usa on loans) student in the uk. I grew up lower class (going to food banks, free school meals, walmart ckothes, hand me downs to/from family, not going out bc i couldnt afford activities) i was accepted into a fashion school.  My current experience is a bit mean. We talk about sustainability in seminars and they speak vapid as if they are from a different reality, even the teachers. They are all shocked at the amount of waste and pollution is caused. For instance, one teacher tried to "expose/shock" us when it came to laundry by asking our methods. I told her i have clothes that are 10+ years old, i dont wash unless the clothes are for sure dirty and i wash at 30c and air dry. My family and i mix and match clothes because we are short and its hard to find good fitting jeans. When we no longer use our clothes we go visit family in mexico and let them pick what they want, whatever is left they sell. A teacher had said most ppl wear 30% of the clothes in their clothes, they also bring up that on average a piece is worn approximately 6 times before it is discarded. I love all my clothes.   Back home, charity shopping was not really an option for me because the shops usually only had big, faded, or itchy fabrics and it wasnt really my style. Walmart, shopko, kmart, jcpenny(during sales) let me dress "stylish" without ppl automatically putting me in the poor category. I made it my mission that when ever i get new clothes that they are comfortable to wear, and that they last both in style and longevity.   Here, charity shopping is easier since their is more variety. I finally have nicer brand clothing (m&s, next, zara, lacoste) but i still do a fabric/style check to ensure longevity.   I see all this nice clothes that i want to buy and send it to my family.	episode_done:True
text:How does your makeup style and clothing style relate? - discussion	labels:Oh heavily, I have a very particular makeup direction that corresponds with my style. My style is best summarised as [Maximalist 70s Sorceress](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/89754l/sorceress_of_the_high_tower_a_maximalist_witch/) and I usually work with that rather than against it.   I usually pick either my makeup first and an outfit with it or the reverse. Either way there‚Äôs typically some kind of vision.   My eyeshadow is almost always warm toned (including warm teals, warm greens etc), bold and ideally with an interesting texture. I have a very particular vision for what I consider [Sorceress makeup](https://pin.it/14e23zd) to be for shows and my mental imaginings of books and generally what I‚Äôd just love to see and do enjoy trying to translate that over onto myself.   90% of my looks are some kind of medium-depth warm toned shadow both above and below the eye in an approximate oval shape. Much of the time with a barely less dark foiled shadow or interestingly dimensional top coat on top. Usually no obvious eyeliner as I usually reserve winged liner for dedicated looks and prefer a bit of liner on the upper waterline or a colour that doesn‚Äôt contrast the eyeshadow too much (I actually quite like dark brown liner with bronze eyeshadow for example) blurred out into the shadow. My regular eyeshadow looks almost never have discernible sharp lines used anywhere.   The remaining 10% is either extremely editorial looks with eye gloss, unusual liner colours, graphic shapes, draped blush, washes of foils and multichrome shadows, excessive quantities of sparkly top coats, ultra blown out grunge looks, etc. Or attempts at a natural but visibly alternative look*   My eyebrows are always the same copper as my hair and naturally full looking (something that‚Äôs completely faked using brow gel and pencil). I favour a dewy or fresh satin finish for foundation, draped or reasonably visible blush in a variety of warm tones, ranging from orange and warm light brown nudes to deep rosewood berry tones. I only wear wet look highlighters without sparkle but don‚Äôt wear highlighter all the time either.   I prefer all my lipstick to be applied without a sharp lip line. For the last few years I‚Äôve been following the current Korean lip trends of filling in the whole lip with colour with soft edges (often a velvet matte formula) and doing a seamless gradient of colour. Or doing the same thing with an easily layered pigmented glossy tint. I still do this with my remaining liquid lipsticks on heavily moisturised and prepped lips, or preferably with K-Beauty tints or ultra beautiful and comfortable standard bullet lipsticks. (Forever recommending the Bobbi Brown Crushed Lip Colours for that - especially Cranberry and Bare)   Because I‚Äôm a freelance artist there is no 'professional look' I actually need to achieve so I just pick the level of drama of the outfit or makeup and work with that.   When I do wear a more conventional look for much more casual things (e.g. jeans and a tee for lunch with friends, pre-Plague obviously) I‚Äôd do a graphic more editorial eye look that‚Äôs simple to do to match the flares I‚Äôll inevitably be wearing and maybe pick colours from my jewellery or tee for the look itself. I‚Äôm especially fond of picking a less dominant colour from a design and having my makeup reflect that.   Inherently an editorial look might seemingly clash with the casual fits but I usually let my jewellery and accessories bring the whole thing together.	episode_done:True

text:Knit Tie Inspo / Lookbook	labels:Are knit ties and Grenadine the same thing, or is there a distinction somewhere?
text:No, the two are similar but distinct from one another. The knit tie is, as seen in the album, a reasonably chunky textured and more casual tie that is often skinnier (often around 6cm) and and largely features a square end.   The grenadine tie is a standard, pointed end tie in a silk grenadine weave. They far more closely resemble a "normal" silk tie and are therefore a more business appropriate option and a great way to add texture to an otherwise plain tie.

text:Just how revolutionary is Harry Styles‚Äô Vogue cover?	labels:Women look better in dresses.  You can be as progressive and woke as you want, and encourage whatever you want so people can express themselves, but aesthetics dont care about that stuff. Womens clothing is typically styled to cater to the female (sex) body. People always comment on the dress itself, or whether it works, but never how that same outfit would just look better on a female.  This is a matter of aesthetic and taste to some extent, and thinking that men generally look bad in dresses is a justified opinion.
text:This seems like an incomplete comment to me for a couple of reasons.  First, the argument that women look better in dresses isn't particularly useful, because that same reasoning could be applied to everyone, but just in this way; 'a more attractive person would look better in this' the comment doesn't isn't actually talking about this person in this piece of clothing.  Second, I think a big flaw around this is that women tend to look better in dresses because women have had thousands of years of aesthetic development to make dresses look good on them. I think that this dress itself conveys that quite well, the collar of this dress looks out of place to me and I think that is because the dress is held back by that idea that a dress is for women, and the design language and cut's haven't developed around men so much.  In particular, the style of ball gowns in particular which this dress effectively is, fall into that much harder than another type of dress might, more casual shirt-dresses that button down the front that can repurpose some of the aesthetic of mens shirts etc and would make the transition over to being worn by men with less of this friction.	labels:Men almost never look good in dresses, and therefore, should very very seldom wear them. I dont see how that is a useless argument? Cardigans also look feminine and terrible everytime men wear them (for reference, they even make [Steve McQueen](https://image-cdn.hypb.st/https%3A%2F%2Fhypebeast.com%2Fimage%2F2019%2F04%2Fsteve-mcqueen-son-tom-ford-cardigan-lawsuit-trademark-2.jpg?q=75&w=800&cbr=1&fit=max) look frail and weak.  So you want to change womens clothing to be made for men? Is that not why they are currently a separate thing? This whole issue arises from people wanting to express themselves by wearing whatever they want (which is cool), but they wont accept that everybody else thinks it looks bad. If youre a guy and you want to wear a dress then you should be able to but you cant also ask people not to judge you on it.  The current aesthetic exists because it is what people think looks good and frankly this notion that we have to change our fashion tastes to be progressive is complete nonsense. Are you going to tell me I should enjoy eating plants more than meat because its better for the environment? I can do it, but it sucks because meat is awesome. Men can wear dresses, but they will look terrible to the mass population of people and thats just how it is.	episode_done:True

text:What are people's experiences with clothing challenges like trying not to buy clothes for a year/only buying second hand? What are some tips?	labels:I'm currently doing a no-buy for clothing for 2020, though I am allowed to sew my own and to purchase undergarments. I spent the first half of the year sewing almost a garment a week, and then suddenly realized I was burnt out of sewing.  I found it really hard earlier in the year when there were so many sales because I love a deal, and I did end up buying one hiking sweatshirt that I regret buying. I reasoned with myself that the sun protection fabric was worth it for my health when walking the dogs, but in hindsight I wish I had made it the whole year without caving. I've also found that since shopping is not an option, I don't do much online window shopping anymore and I've unsubscribed from all promotional emails. I've literally gotten hours of my week back.   When coming up with these challenges, I think it's really important to create a pain point that is not too painful. You need to cause yourself discomfort in order to grow, but going cold turkey is not necessarily the best. I slowly got to a no-buy after years of budgeting, giving myself item limits, and even now allowing myself to sew clothes. I also write down all the other things I want and make myself wait 30 days to buy them, which helps me identify what I really want (turns out its not perfume like I thought it was).  You should also ask yourself why are you creating your challenge. You mention both the environment and your bank account, but could it be deeper than that? I also told myself I was creating the challenge to reduce my consumption and save more, but I've realized during this challenge that I want to find some level of contentment with what I have, and stop being on the search for the perfect bag/shoes/running tights/perfume etc. So when I have a first thought of "I need that item" I purposefully remind myself to be content with what I already have. Then if I still feel like I need it, I put it on the list and wait. I have had so many clothing patterns, specific items of clothes, and shoes on the list that I've all removed over time because in the end I don't actually want them.	episode_done:True

text:Do you have any pieces that "should not" work with your body that just seems to work?	labels:I don't think you strictly need to follow any specific rules... but if you're still figuring out what works for you, I can see why having some guidelines to go from would be helpful. So, if you're interested in styling systems in general, may I suggest exploring the Kibbe types? YMMV but the main principle is about highlighting your existing bone structure instead of trying to make every body shape conform to a single ideal.   By that system, you probably fit into the Dramatic type and so strong angles and clean lines would be super flattering. There are some good Youtube videos that go into the details of the different types.
text:While I don't follow his book/advice (it's a bit outdated fashionwise anyway), reading about Kibbe's body types and other people's takes on them made me realize that nearly every other body type advice out there is meant to mold women into an hourglass shape and hide the features that don't conform to that mold. This has had a lasting impact on how I sew and alter my own clothes, though probably not in the way the author intended... I'm 90% sure I fall into the 'flamboyant gamine' type, but I often wear 'natural' type clothes. But both are quite far from the usual "this will look flattering and more like the ideal hourglass" advice. I've freed myself from the mental clutter of "wear a column of colour to look taller" and "wear wide skirts to balance out your shoulders" because no matter what you do these are attributes you just *can't* hide so you might as well work with them, not against them.	labels:I agree that a lot of the details don't really apply so much these days, but I also really appreciate the principle of working with what you got.   I will say I think his ideas about "essence" are total nonsense. By his typing I probably fit into either the theatrical romantic or romantic type, but I much prefer the aesthetic of the soft natural type.

Also, if you do value horn versus leather buttons, you are further slicing your options - there is a strong correlation with Scottish knits with "tradition", and that means the default tends to be leather buttons. In fact, years ago I was at NMWA when a S&C order came in... with leather buttons. I think that meant they had to ship back a few cubic yards worth of cardigans
text:You're right, there aren't short cuts to this level of quality.  I think this knit represents the best entry level option for this sort of sweater. It's not as heavy, but it's FAR from insubstantial.  I don't mind the leather buttons, but they definitely add a level of "Old fogey" vibes if you're not careful.  Even horn buttons can miss the mark, I saw the new Spier & Mackay chunky cardigan and a common comment is that the buttons are just a bit too large.	labels:	episode_done:True

I usually don't want to mess around with pictures/shipping though.   I have a spot in the back of my closet for five (!!!) things I like but I won't wear. I figure it's few enough things that I can keep them for sentimentality but it makes me really think about why I'm keeping things.   In order to help me purge I had a considerate friend who helped me be ruthless. "Are you going to wear that? Does it mean anything to you? Into the donate box with you!"  However anything not suitable for donation was "smuggled" out of the house to be either tossed or turned into rags, but I couldn't bear to watch.
text:I like the mental release of having a designated number of things I can guiltily keep. Absolutes and harsh rules are hard mentally, but it's easier to pick out the couple of things "I wanna keep for keeping's sake" vs just tossing the whole lot.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:What are some differences between stereotypical Millennial and Gen Z fashion/aesthetics?	labels:As someone that's between a Gen Xer and a Millenial, I find it amusing that Gen Zs look down on Millenials as being "old" and that now "Millenial" is used as a derogatory term for "outdated".   It doesn't seem that long ago that Millenials were the ones that were the young upstarts.
text:I was lowkey offended when Gen Zs said Millennials were old, but then I realized that a lot of the styles they wear were straight up outfits I wore when I was in  elementary school.

[Taylor Stitch Long Haul Jacket in Black Over-dye Selvage](https://www.taylorstitch.com/products/long-haul-jacket-in-black-over-dye-selvage)  The Taylor Stitch jacket is my first experience with the brand. It looks nice, but I missized by going with an XXL. I'm usually an XL in TTS jackets but tend to size up so I can layer more easily. XXL fit me really big even for what I'm usually accustomed to so I immediately started the exchange process for an XL. I'm hoping it'll fit much better.  And my new [Panerai Luminor Due](https://imgur.com/a/2OkrJVJ)  It's my first Panerai and I really like the way the 42mm case size fits on my 7.5 inch wrist. With it being a white dial watch, I think I'll wear it a lot more than my other watches. Most of my watches have either black or blue dials so I tend to only wear those with shirts that have similar colors.

Waterproof boots and thin but effective base layers will be a god send.   - sweaters are important.

I invested in my everyday puffer jacket, but my ski jacket and snow pants were like 35$ total thrifted.	episode_done:True

text:"Can people just hate fashion again" - Synecdoche When Talking about the "Industry" Discussion	labels:Sorry, this is gonna be a reallyyyyy long one. As someone who got a degree in fashion but never formally worked in the industry \*cries\*, I'm always dying to talk about it. Especially since I moved to a state where there is literally zero fashion industry and I have no one to talk to. Thanks to everyone here for always being my fashion therapist.  \-  I think that being a "clothes lover" usually just means that you enjoy fashion in the contemporary sense. You probably look to more modern brands and care about more modern issues like where your clothes are coming from or cultural appropriation in the industry. You probably care about the celebrity/influencer culture around fashion. You probably see it as a great form of self-expression.  On the flip side, I think that being a "fashion lover" usually just means you enjoy fashion in the traditional high fashion sense. You probably see it as wearable art. You probably enjoy the rich history of some of these old luxury fashion houses. You probably nerd out about the craftsmanship of some luxury pieces. You probably enjoy the politics that have always surrounded fashion.  Neither one of these are better than the other. They're just different. And if you're going to put being a "clothing lover" down, then you need to work to make being a "fashion lover" more accessible. Because I can follow account like Diet Prada or follow a tag on Twitter to learn about contemporary fashion all day. But I had to get a literal fashion degree to have the information I needed to be a "fashion lover". Not everyone can afford to go to college, and not everyone wants to get into thousands of dollars in debt to major in fashion.  \-  Ultimately, clothing is a commodity and you do have to make money with your products if you want it to continue to exist. But that shouldn't be the only reason that you're making clothing. And I do think the technology has made a major impact on designers' attitudes towards clothing and traditional fashion.  Fast fashion has created this culture of ultra-consumerism where trends come and go in the blink of an eye. Quality and fit aren't at the top of anyone's priority list anymore, and you can forget about getting anything tailored. Wearing the same piece for more than a season is unusual. The average consumer is accustomed to receiving a piece of clothing quickly and cheaply from anywhere in the world. And it's made fashion become really disposable.  A lot of luxury brands are associated with "high fashion" or "traditional fashion" because they're pretty old (Louis Vuitton started making trunks in the 1850's), so at one point they existed in a time where beautiful craftsmanship and bespoke pieces were expected. Only the rich were able to afford new clothing. In a time where having the biggest skirts and the tallest hats and the most lavish silks was the tell-tale sign of wealth, designers could be as creative and outrageous as they wanted.  But today, even a lot of luxury brands have lessened their quality and simplified their designs to try and keep up with the expectations that fast fashion has brought. So fashion houses that were known for being historically very elaborate are now making the same generic pieces as everyone else so they don't become irrelevant.  Social media has made a huge impact on the creativity of designers (or lack thereof). There are definitely designers out there who just do it for the clout. I've worked with them before, and they suck. Their main focuses are to have Kim K sitting in their front row, dressing celebrities on the red carpet, and having 1 million followers on Instagram. Unfortunately a lot of designers are stifling their creativity (and some just don't have any in the first place) to try and fit the "mold" of being a designer that's been perpetuated by social media and celebrity culture. And a lot of people who previously would have never been interested in fashion are into it all of the sudden because of the glamor behind it.  \-  Lastly, Louise Wilson sounds super pretentious and I would hate to have been one of her students. If she's complaining about the lack of creativity in fashion, then she should be encouraging her students' creativity instead of shooting them down. That's not a person you want teaching the next generation of designers.  If she were to tell me I dress like Topman, I'd ask why she's a teacher rather than a designer herself since she seems to have so many "amazing" ideas about fashion. Or maybe she just gets off on being a pretentious witch and abusing her power. Which is the case for most of the fashion industry anyways and the main reason why I never worked in it lol
text:Seriously, most people have this idea how luxury fashion is always top of the line and nothing ever goes wrong with whichever piece you buy, which is absolutely not the case anymore. Luxury fashion is a business, and they will cut corners where they see fit - that's why you get $1,200 handbags made out of cheap saffiano leather, or nylon clothing, or viscose/polyester everything.   Like yes, your Louis Vuitton bag is higher quality than something you'll find at Target or Michael Kors, but if anything that only means you have to be _more_ careful with it. Some people have unreasonable expectations with luxury and want their pieces to actually outlive them.	labels:You bringing up saffiano leather triggered me lol.

Shearling is substantial and plush and it will keep you much warmer than other ‚Äúladylike‚Äù gloves (but not as warm as say [hulky ski/snow gloves](https://m.shopbop.com/arctic-down-gloves-canada-goose/vp/v=1/1562477539.htm?extid=SE_froogle_SC_usa&currencyCode=USD&ef_id=CjwKCAjw_Y_8BRBiEiwA5MCBJgz0i4HKVr9k1S4NLRkScaueHxJ5gECZPKsDNsYxTEnPYR3Z_C6-xxoCbE4QAvD_BwE%3AG%3As&cvosrc=cse.google.CANAD30182&cvo_campaign=SB_Google_USD&gclid=CjwKCAjw_Y_8BRBiEiwA5MCBJgz0i4HKVr9k1S4NLRkScaueHxJ5gECZPKsDNsYxTEnPYR3Z_C6-xxoCbE4QAvD_BwE)).  - [Sosken Studios](https://soskenstudios.com/collections/coats-jackets) - Winter coats and style are hard to reconcile, but leave it once again to the Canadians!

Some of their wool coats have [puffer built in](https://www.soiakyo.com/us/en/evette-classic-wool-coat-with-quilted-puffer-lining/EVETTE-C.html), which we can all agree is a rare and precious thing. **Note:** Neither Sosken or Soia & Kyo will keep you toasty like a Moncler or Canada Goose type down thing for the arctic, but they are perfect for bridging that gap between ‚Äústylish wool car coat‚Äù and ‚ÄúMichelin Man Snowsuit‚Äù weather.  - [Icebreaker thermals](https://www.icebreaker.com/en-us/womens-baselayers) - I hate spending money on thermals, and [Uniqlo‚Äôs Heattech line](https://www.uniqlo.com/us/en/women/heattech) is honestly good enough for almost everything. And then my husband took me ice fishing in Northern Minnesota and I spent the whole time wondering whether merely agreeing to go on the trip or marrying him in general was a terrible life decision but what was definitely not a terrible life decision was picking up some of these.

I ordered these black ones at $40 a piece from some European online sock store and hated every moment of it. Now it‚Äôs 3 years later and I am glad I spent the money. They are warm, slightly translucent so not frumpy like completely opaque tights can be, and unlike smartwool, they do not have the white ‚ÄúSmartwool‚Äù logo above the toe line so you can actually wear these with normal pumps in transitional weather. They also pilled less than smartwool. They are the only reason why I can continue to wear dresses and skirts to the office in the winter.  - [Love your melon](https://loveyourmelon.com/) - purveyors of the basic white girl beanie pom hats, or ‚Äútoques.‚Äù What I like about them is that they are thick knit and almost universally flattering.

text:What female TV characters do you think are well-styled and worthy of imitation?	labels:I like watching Mindy Kaling‚Äôs character in the office since she has a similar body type to me but we have different palettes :/ looking for other curvy icons.
text:Mindy Kahling has a super distinct style. No shade to her, but it's definitely a very niche look that isn't going to be most people's cut of tea. It's a very "love it on her, absolute no for myself".   I've heard stylists and costume people love working with her because they get to have so much more fun than most female stars (who just want flattering, unassuming looks most of the time). (Plus, I'm sure it doesn't hurt that she's also a producer on all her projects.)  She definitely has a body type not well represented on TV which is crazy since I feel like that's what a lot of women look like. Not skinny, not fat, not graded with abundant curves or a super athletic frame. Just kind of average in every way.   I also have a similar body type, and I've pretty much given up on trying to find women who look like me in Hollywood (which is insane considering I am average height, in an average weight range, cis gendered, and white. I am the most generic looking person in America , I should be overwhelmed with representation)	labels:I worked at a store she regularly bought from like 6ish years ago! I helped her stylist pick some things for some events. We had really quirky stuff, and one of the dresses she bought was so fun and I was so jealous that it looked good on her (I loved it but it was not for my body type). Her stylist for that season of events or whatever was super nice, I never got to talk to Mindy, though.	episode_done:True

text:Another Canadian chiming in: slush is not really a concern for at least 4 months of winter where I am - too cold for anything to melt. Slush is a spring problem. I have some long heavy skirts appropriate for fall, but fall is so damn short I only get like 3 wears in. I'd love to wear them into winter, especially with added layers to be warmer than pants.

text:Has anyone else ever tried on a designer item just to see what the hype is about?	labels:I love to try on designer then check the labels for fabric content. Polyester, rayon, acrylic, etc. Nasty plastics that are short lived and cheaply produced, just like fast fashion brands. Sometimes not, but shockingly often.
text:A lot of the synthetic fabrics actually last longer than the natural, it‚Äôs generally the construction of the garment and feel that ends up being different most times. I‚Äôve noticed that even high end designer brands use the same synthetics and to me certain fabrics look more expensive. Like synthetic chiffon for some reason looks more expensive and holds up for a long time than silk. I even have some dirt cheap chiffon button downs from Walmart that I got out of the sales section for four bucks and I‚Äôve gotten comments from people about how they look expensive. It‚Äôs also about fit on whether or not a garment looks more expensive on you. That‚Äôs why I prefer to try clothes on before purchasing.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What do YOU do with "chub rub" jeans?	labels:This thread is absolutely fascinating to me, as I‚Äôve literally never experienced jeans wearing at the inner thigh before, or anywhere except for the bottom hems when I was a teen and wore them too long. And I only ever buy cheap jeans (¬£20-40). I‚Äôm not super slim either, I‚Äôve ranged from UK 8-16 over the years in jeans sizes and wear the heck out of them. I‚Äôm still wearing some jeans that cost maybe ¬£30 from a decade ago regularly and they look like new!  I had no idea this was an issue, let alone a major one. I‚Äôd be furious and heartbroken if I spent ¬£50 on a pair and only got two years wear from them, that‚Äôs nuts. Super enlightening thread!
text:Me neither, and I used to wear the same two pairs of jeans daily. I think one thing is that I don't ever use the dryer (it uses too much energy when I have a space to hang them up to air dry).

text:Inspo Album - Statement Sweaters	labels:Lovely and inspiring album, OP. And I especially appreciate you listing prices. But that's also the problem, at least for me.   The statement all these statement sweaters seem to making is, "I pay more for sweaters than some people pay for cars."   The "goodwill chic" sweater is over a thousand dollars. Goodwill? Srsly?  Do people *really* pay this much for sweaters? How do they also pay their rent? Put kids through college? Save for retirement? I make over $200K a year, and I honestly don't get how you can even consider a purchase like this. Much as I love some of these styles.

Dude, relax, it's just a question. One that feels very germane to the sub, btw. Price is extremely relevant to male fashion. Isn't that why OP included prices? Can we not talk about it?  If you can spend a thousand dollars on a sweater and choose to do so, I say more power to you. But I'm honestly asking: is that really a thing for the people on this sub?

The puff sleeve + pilgrim collar + tiered prairie look is really giving me polygamist cult vibes. üòµ   I also think the side cutouts just look toooo trendy and juvenile, but maybe I‚Äôm just getting old. Some of the back cutouts are cool though.  I strongly prefer cleaner lines and more sculptural silhouettes as opposed to the poofy, frilly silhouettes happening here. I wish prints were trendier though! I like the silhouettes of the more minimalist dresses, but the colors are soooo boring. I love a dress that has a simple shape but has a fun print or cool texture or interesting details like embroidery.

text:How do you dress for the (extreme) weather where you're from?	labels:I‚Äôm from up north and was adapted to cold but now will be kicking it long-term down south not too far off from Florida swamps. I‚Äôm just here hoping to pick up tips. Please, someone from a very humid and hot place, post your secrets. I‚Äôve lived in socal before and can handle dry heat but the humid heat sucks my soul out of my face pores. Thank goodness it‚Äôs starting to cool down. It‚Äôs my third summer here and still my most glimmering hope is for public nudity to become legal, widespread, and accepted in the region so I can let the hot humid breeze be my regalia.  The best advice I‚Äôve gotten from a native so far is from a man who said ‚Äúembrace the heat‚Äù and wears a hoodie and toboggan (what they call knit hats down here) in the summer. So I‚Äôve done that, I‚Äôve embraced the heat at least so I can not feel total despair when I have to wear pants in my workspace.  But if there are any other humid heat tips people have out there, I am a willing student. Magic fabrics? Sizing up so everything isn‚Äôt so hard to get out of? Would a swimsuit instead of a bra be advisable?
text:Ok, for one, that fool running around in the hoodie and hat is gonna die of heatstroke.   Linen. Loose fitting clothing. Light colors. Absent that, as little clothing as possible. Sarongs are cute. Crop tops are cute. I come from the south and if my feet can't breathe, I can't deal. Havainanas are fantastic long term flip flops.   I do think swimsuits are more absorbent. Cotton is better from a smell perspective though. No bra would be the 8th circle of hell for me, but a cotton bralette is more of a 4th circle of hell. Natural fibers. That's the key. Nylon or rayon or polyester makes you sweat and also stink. Avoid like the plague.   Source: From 90+ humidity areas.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Sharing the Pants: Androgyn-ish trends album	labels:I love a lot of looks in this album, especially #4 and #24!  I‚Äôm wondering if anyone has found similar looks on curvier or pear-shaped bodies. It may not look quite so androgynous since we associate taller and straighter figures with menswear, but I really like the menswear-inspired style and struggle to adapt it to my body. For example, straight jeans and trousers don‚Äôt create that same straight line from the waist because they often cling to wider hips and thighs.  One thing that does work for me is belted skirts and shirts (sort of like this look from [Margaret Howell](https://www.margarethowell.co.uk/womens/shop/all/fly-front-shirt-yarn-dye-cotton-corn)), which can look very utilitarian if you have the right fabrics and details. Chunky shoes and oversized coats also work. Anyone else have tips on this?

text:Sweatshirt: I'm shocked by my purchasing decision from yesterday and needed to share	labels:This sub told me all about  Reigning Champ and how great the sweatshirt is. Threw down the $100+ it took for a really nice teal and TBH aside from the color, it's the same softness as my Russell Athletic sweatshirt from college from 15 years ago. Then my brother lent me a sweatshirt from Zara he bought for $40 and it's the cats pajamas.   This is my biggest issue with buying online. And I trust that the quality of a lot of the things recommended here are really great...but sometimes it's led me astray.
text:quality isn't defined solely by comfort or even price. A lot of the price of RC comes from the fact that it's made in Canada, so wages are naturally higher, it doesn't matter how crappy an item is, it's always going to be more expensive that way.   Also, I don't have RC and honestly don't like how it looks but a big part of it is also quality of fabric (most likely to hold up well) and construction. Also, a lot of cheaper sweatshirts will have a polyester fleece interior, which is easy to be made soft but also doesn't hold up as well and tends to be a lot flimsier.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 10, 2021	labels:Can someone help me with my fashion? 26 Alopecia (bald with no facial hair, eyebrows) Pale.  &#x200B;  How can I make the best of the unfortunate hand I have been dealt?  These are the things I have been thinking about so far:  \-Bulk up(currently 180, 6ft)  \-subtle tanning lotion?  \-buy more suitable glasses frames.  \-Wear dark colors (black, blue, grey, Navy)  \-get bold accessories like tattoos or rings/necklaces/hats/scarves  \-footwear? I have no fucking clue.  Where do I even start? Any advice would be amazing!
text:Guy who needed to shave his head at 26 due to balding here. I'll throw in my 2 cents:  >-Bulk up(currently 180, 6ft)  This could be good, but one thing I'd caution is don't put on too much bulk and lose definition in your face. Part of the reason the bald dude with beard (present company included) stereotype exist is that without hair there is less to break out and accentuate the features of your face. I'm your height, but on the other side of the bulk spectrum. I carry a decent bit of muscle, but also too much fat if I don't watch my diet. Bald and round face is not the best combo, especially with out any non-head hair to break it up. I would think unless you are dramatically skinny fat,  6' 180 would be pretty close to ideal of what women like, (or gay men if that is your brand) so I would say likely you just want to do a bit of lifting and recompose a little at most. You're probably decent on that front. (I cam DM you some workouts if you are new and completely lost)  >subtle tanning lotion  I'm not great on the skin care, but do think a little bit of tan probably enhances the features a bit, so this probably isn't terrible if you want to try it  >Wear dark colors (black, blue, grey, Navy) >get bold accessories like tattoos or rings/necklaces/hats/scarves  Tattoo's above the neck can still carry a stigma, so that's a bolder lifestyle choice you'll have to make and could be determined by your career options. But if something speaks to you, go for it. Outside of tattoos, I'd say go as bold as you possibly can and still be remotely comfortable (and be pushing that line) You already have something that is going to make you stand out, so lean in to it and have it be a fun and interesting way. I wear a lot of hats and to have more accessories where it would work. You're not trying to "hide" anything, but it allows you bring some variety and expression to your look that hair styling grants to others. You've been given a blanker canvass, make the most of it.   Not sure you need this pep talk or not, but I've had way more relationships with beautiful and interesting women since shaving everything off than before went I fit closer to the traditional ideal. /u/cooldude_4000 mentioned Anthony Carrigan, who I generally think looks cool as fuck most of the time I see him.

text:How many pairs of jeans and pairs of shoes should you own?	labels:I don't think this is about living in abundance, so much as it is about fast fashion and guilt about getting rid of unfashionable items.   With fast fashion, women have to content with the fact that their clothes are often made in way worse quality than most men's clothes, while at the same time not feeling like they can justify spending an extra 20 dollars on, say, a T-shirt. This makes clothes wear out or get ugly much faster than it should, perhaps making lower income women both panic and trying to get as much as possible in time, but also not feeling like she can justify throwing out clothes that are only 6 months old. So she may have a closet filled with unwearable clothes, that may looked good when she bought them, but is now borderline embarrassing/homely looking to wear out in public.   Some may go in the other direction and invest in classical items that take a long time to show wear and tear, but are also much more expensive - like quality shoes and bags. The problem is, after about 5 years, things that used to be considered classic can now be considered outdated, and the world has moved on. But the shoes and bags cost a lot - so they end up keeping those in the back of the closet or behind loads of outerwear.   They tell themselves that this will last them, these purchases are good, or they are cheap so you have to buy them even though they fade in the first wash - looking straight into the face of capitalism, and realizing that you are supposed to keep buying and buying and buying no matter what you do, in order to not be looked down upon in society, can be kind of dark. And most people really want to feel stylish, since a huge part of confidence is how we feel about our looks. So they ambivalently keep those items, because they know that it is too wasteful to throw them away, but they also can't stop buying new stuff - because they know how they look in the eyes of other people, if they stopped caring and lived in a more frugal, sustainable way.
text:I can completely relate to your fast fashion and guilt perspectives. I have shoes in my closet from college (late 90s) that I've kept for more than 20 years, some are brands like Aldo or Nine West, and include basic and classic styles, but had the heel that was on trend at that time. I've held on to these shoes due to feeling guilty at throwing out something that was in good condition and I paid for using my hard-earned college girl money. Honestly, though, right now I'm glad I did save them because because the styles are returning and I love to mix "vintage" with my now woman-of-the-age-at-the-far-end-of-the-age spectrum in the article type of lifestyle. I have noticed that the quality of these relatively inexpensive fast fashion shoes from 20 years ago was much better then - full leather upper and sole construction with full stitching - than what shoes of that tier offer in present day.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - February 16, 2021	labels:Hello friends  I've come to request some advice and I appreciate all and any opinions on this.   I'm moving to South Korea in July for at least a year. I'll be following the well-trodden path of teaching English at a private school out there. As far as I know this does not require me to wear a suit on a day-to-day basis, and I've get plenty of business casual items I can work with.  I'm looking to buy a casually tailored sports coat/blazer and matching trousers. I've got my eye on some stuff from Universal Works, it's a brand I've got experience with and I'm UK based so it works out pretty cheaper.  I'm interested in one of their Barra jackets but it's in cotton herringbone, and the closest matching trousers I can find are wool marl, both in Charcoal. There is a 3-button jacket in wool marl which is intended to be worn as a suit, but the fit of the 3-button is more 50s and I'm not confident that it'll look good. These items are massively discounted at the moment so it seems like a good opportunity to get some cheap long lasting pieces, but obviously it's no good if they look bad.   What I'm asking is, 1. do you think I can pair herringbone with wool marl or should I go for the matching fabric? 2. should I bother at all, let this go and maybe just buy something that fits the bill in Korea?

text:How do you shop at TJ Maxx/Marshall‚Äôs?	labels:Former TJ Maxx employee and was cross-trained in all sections. Just want to reiterate the advice that basically you find out what the delivery days are and visit often. That said there are some overall trends based on the seasons but no, we didn't know exactly what type of brands we would get. However each store has a type of range based on the average income in the area. My store was relatively new when I was hired so the range had not been adapted to the actual income level until maybe 2 years later to when I was working there. The more established stores in neighboring cities that has more 'older' money surrounding it always got great stuff.  That said, I worked mainly in the jewelry, perfume/cosmetic and luggage/bags section and I don't know what my superior had, but she had some pull with the higher ups when it came to orders for the jewelry section (she also used to own her own jewelry store that probably helped). Our sales number for jewelry was impressive and I worked there from 2016-2011 so a good chunk of that time during the 2008 economic crash and the subsequent recession.

Once I get into something, I dive way too deep which led me to consume any content available about t-shirts. The goal was to learn what makes a t-shirt great and what would suit me the best. A few days filled with reading Reddit posts and blogs and nearly $600 later, I received the top few brand that were mentioned frequently. I put them all through their paces and made sure I tested them as thoroughly as I could to find the best t-shirt available right now.  &#x200B;  My look for three things in a perfect t-shirt: the fits, the feel, and the construction. My definition of a good fit is one that drapes well, hugs the arms and is fitted in the chest but leaves some room in the stomach for after a meal. For the feel, I'm looking for something that is soft to the touch and smooth. In terms of quality, I like a heavier t-shirt that has a solid collar that doesn't deform and doesn't shrink when it's washed.  &#x200B;  For reference: these are all a small or medium. I went off the measurements on the size charts.  I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10‚Äù, 175 lbs.  # Uniqlo:  Lets start with the famous the Uniqlo Supima Cotton Crewneck T-Shirt. I've read high praises for this tee on various subs and decided to give it a shot after seeing everyone swear by them. The shirt is 100% Supima cotton which is just a brand of cotton that is grown in California, Texas, New Mexico or Arizona. It is supposedly amongst the top 1% of cotton grown in the world. Extra long fibers that give it more strength, softness and color retention compared to normal cotton. Theres no weight that is advertised but the fabric feels thin in comparison to the others on this list.  The fit is in between a slim fit and a regular fit. It hugs the arms well, and leaves room in the stomach but shrinks a bit after a wash. I opted for a small and it fits well. The neck opening is on the smaller end and wears higher than the rest which may be a plus depending on your preference. I got a small and it fit like I'd expect it to.  For a $15 the t-shirt is decent at best. The quality isn't there and this shirt doesn't hold up after a few washes. I noticed a little bit of shrinkage after a wash and it lost some of it's initial softness. It compared to a normal J.Crew t-shirt after the wash. In the review section on Uniqlo's website, customers have said the quality on these used to be very good but has gone down in recent months when the production factory shifted from Cambodia to Vietnam. They say the fabric feels thinner, fits worse and doesn't hold up as well.  The collar feels pretty weak and although its fine now, I suspect it will develop a bacon neck in a few more washes.  Overall for $15 it's still a solid tee for anyone on a budget but considering companies like Bella and Canvas make similar quality t-shirts for $4, I'd rather spend my money there and save up for something a bit higher end.  # Cuts Clothing:  Next up we have the Cuts Clothing Split Hem Crewneck tee. Just a quick heads up, their marketing is insanely persistent so be prepared for them to take over all your Youtube, Facebook and Instagram ads as soon as you visit their website. I decided to go with it just to see what the hype was all about. Immediately out of the box the t-shirt was insanely soft and bouncy. It's made of Cuts own fabric called Pyca which is a blend of Cotton, Spandex and Polyester. The fabric has four way stretch for comfort and doesn't wrinkle easily. The fabric feels very 'performance' oriented in a synthetic way even though it's made to wear casually. That isn't a bad thing but just something to note compared to the 100% cotton options on this list.  I opted for a medium as the fit is on the slimmer end. The tee sits a bit long and bunches up near my waist and makes my legs look very short when I wear these with cuffed jeans. I do prefer to wear these with joggers or black jeans to make them look more streamlined.  They have a "build your own" concept where you choose between three necks: a crewneck, a v-neck, or a henley, and three bottoms: an elongated curve, a split hem, and a classic curve. They all run slightly long which could be ideal for streetwear styles. The color pallet is always on point because they stick close to neutrals tones while adding new shades every season. This is the Arctic Haze color which was a light green available a few seasons ago.  The fabric is thin and breathable but does not feel cheap. The collar is very thin so it eliminates the chances of deforming after a few washes. I haven't experienced any shrinkage at all even after multiple washes.  At $48 we can see where their marketing budget comes from but I'm impressed by the buttery fabric, the stretch, how low maintenance it is, and the fit. I probably wouldn't buy another pair due to the length and the price. If the length suits your body then this might not be a bad option but there are higher quality shirts out there for cheaper.
text:# Part 2:  # EVERLANE:  Up next lets talk about the Everlane Premium Weight Crew in a size small. Although it is marked as a slim fit, this is the boxiest out of all the t-shirts here leaving plenty of room in the sleeves and through the body. At 6.2 ounces, I love the weight of this T-shirt but it was the most basic feeling of the batch. Reminded me of a fresh Gildan shirt from high school but with more weight. It was scratchy initially but has softened slightly after about a year of washes and wears. The neck has held up pretty well and I love the color of this shirt. Coming in at $30, I would say this isn't worth it in my opinion but if you like boxier fits and a wide variety of colors to choose from, this might be the way to go. I've seen it under $20 on their Pick Your Price section.  # Robert Barakett:  Don't worry, I hadn't heard of the brand either but I was introduced to them when my girlfriend snagged me a white tee from Nordstrom's Anniversary sale last year from them. I went back shortly after and bought the dark grey for myself and then picked up the navy one in this year's sale. The Canadian company calls it the Barakett T but it's also known as the Georgia Crew at discount retailers. It's made from 100% ultra-fine US grown cotton and is finished with a heavy enzyme wash. Robert Barakett claims this helps give it a worn and broken in feel and gives the fabric a slight sheen, both of which I can attest to. The material is cool to the touch and very smooth. I've worn them with joggers and under a sports coat and work well in any situation. These have been a part of my rotation for about a year now and I've experienced no loss of color.  All mine are a size small. They fit a bit large initially but they shrank a good amount on the first wash so keep that in mind when sizing. The shirt's length was perfect when new but is slightly short for me after the shrinkage. The arms and chest region came in nicely and were perfect for me after the wash.  The collar shows no sign of wear even after wearing these regularly for a year. The split hem is a nice feature that prevents any pulling for more athletic legged people.  They are $60 on their website but don't pay that much for this tee. Nordstrom's Anniversary sale brings it down to $38 for all the staple colors and I've seen quirky colors for as low as $20 on Nordstrom Rack. Just be sure you look for the "Georgia" tee on the discount sites. At that price, these are some of the best bang-for-your-buck and are worth stocking up on.  # 3Sixteen:  I've only known 3Sixteen to specialize in denim so I was a little hesitant adding them to this list. However, there seems to be a cult like following for their t-shirts and I had to see what it was all about. This is their Pima T-shirt. The regular crewneck was sold out so I had to opt for the pocket t-shirt but the material and fit are the exact same. Right off the bat, these were super soft to the touch. Almost a viscose like softness to them but they're 100% American grown Pima cotton. The fabrics is roughly 160gsm so it feels substantial in the best way. The collars are very sturdy due to it's triple stitched collar.  After looking at the size chart, I opted for a medium. The fit was okay and was easily the biggest drawback about this T-shirt. The sleeves didn't hug my arms and it was very boxy around the torso area. This might just be my fault and a small could fit how I like. I'll have to give it a shot and edit this once I get results.  The tees are made in the USA so they come at a premium. They're only available in packs of two which I don't really like but a lot of higher end t-shirt brands do this. Colors are limited to black and white in the Pima shirts as of me making this post. 3Sixteen also offer a henley, long sleeve and a heavyweight shirt but they aren't made of the pima fabric so it wont be as soft. They come in at $95 for a pack of two or $47.50 a piece. They're really high quality so the price is justified but they aren't my favorite because of the fit (again, could just be my bad).  # Lady White Company  LWC was literally started on this one t-shirt so my expectations were high. I was super excited to get this shirt in because I was intrigued by the "no side seams". This model is called the "Our T-Shirt". It's made of 100% cotton grown in North Carolina and the t-shirt is cut, sewn, and knitted in Los Angeles.  The construction on this tee was flawless. the double needle stitch sits perfectly on the collar and lines up exactly with the shoulder seam. The fit was relaxed and boxy so I'm glad I got a small to get the fit I look for.  The main feature about this tee is the lack of seams on the side. They claim it helps achieve a more natural drape and allows the T-shirt to conform better to the body. LWC do this by using circular knitting machines that allow the torso area to be sewn as a tube instead of two separate pieces. It's super unique and is something I found really cool. The fabric itself is 6 ounces so it has a very good weight. I was disappointed when I unboxed it and the fabric was very rough. The fabric didn't have that soft brushed like finish that I look for personally. It felt like a fresh vintage tee from the mid 1900s which isn't a bad thing, just something I don't prefer. The knit is dense and sturdy. I would compare this tee to raw denim. It's not the most comfortable and soft out of the bag but you can feel it's heft and sense of quality. It's supposed to break in and get softer the more and more it's worn so I'll have to see what it's like a year from now.  Grey, navy, black and white come in a 2-pack for $99. If you want a different color, you'll be looking at $55 for a single one.  The construction and fit were great and checked my boxes but overall the tshirt was meh because of the feel. I'll probably get heat for this since this t-shirt is supposed to be the holy grail but I just wasn't that impressed, personally. Maybe I just don't get it or I just haven't worn it enough but I don't think I would run out and get another one.  # ASKET  Lastly we have Asket. Asket is a Swedish company started in 2015 with a pursuit to create the best basics and is a minimalist favorite. I've heard a lot about this company and have always wanted to try them out so I went with their regular T-shirt. Asket uses 100% Egyptian cotton and has a weight of 180gsm.  The fabric was soft to the touch, but second to Cuts. It offers enough structure for it to feel well made but flows enough to drapes over the body really well. The fit was probably my favorite out of all the ones I'm reviewing today. Asket offers 15 different sizes for their T-shirts. Ranging from XS to XL and then breaking down further into short, regular and long. It lets everyone find their ideal fit which seems like common sense but is rare for some reason. The t-shirts and dyed, sewn and assembled all in Portugal and the craftsmanship shows. There were no stray threads on either of the t-shirts and everything was put together flawlessly. The collar is ribbed and feels very sturdy. After a few washes I can confirm it holds up just as well as it did when it was brand new.  The fit is what shined through the most. This was snug in all the right places but left just enough room in the stomach area without look sloppy. You still get that streamlined silhouette and tons of versatility with this t-shirt. I opted for a size small and it fit exactly how I expected it too. I could probably also get away with a medium but I'm not sure if it would hug the chest and arms as well.  At $45 this is pricey but worth it in my opinion. Asket offers a great product and their customer service is always willing to help. It offers a simple, well made, crisp t-shirt in a ton of different colors. Overall I was very impressed and it definitely lived up to my expectation.  # TLDR/Overall Rank (value + fit + feel + quality):  1. Asket 2. Robert Barakett 3. Cuts Clothing 4. 3Sixteen (3rd and 4th were a toss up) 5. Lady White Co 6. Uniqlo 7. Everlane  Obviously, this is just my personal opinion based off what I look for. Your order could be the complete opposite and that's okay. Any of these is solid pick (besides Everlane lol). If you guys have any recommendations for tees that you swear by and I left out, lmk and I'd love to check them out!	labels:I think we have people like yourself that want a very soft tee and people like myself that want a stiffer, rougher tee.

Fashionista's please help.	labels:All of the other comments that I had the energy to read through are REALLY helpful, and I learned a thing or two!   What‚Äôs actually helped me elevate my personal style is spending some quality time with my closet. Just being in your room and trying out how different pieces look together (and experimenting with stuff you wouldn‚Äôt normally wear) will give you a better sense of what you might want to add to your closet, as well as open your eyes to pairings that you didn‚Äôt previously consider.	episode_done:True
text:Changing your mindset from fast fashion to one of investment pieces. What did you learn?	labels:Honestly, I learned that the "investment" pieces of today are of quality that is way lower than it should be at those price points. Cashmere, silk, etc today are worse than they were 20 years ago and there is a large quality spectrum in these fabrics. Stitching and durability is also a major problem. For me, investment pieces are clothes that have a forgiving return policy so that I can buy, take home and try out of the day, perhaps dry clean or wash a few times before I make a decision on keeping that item. If they have a repair or replacement guarantee that lasts a few years, even better. I don't mind paying the big bucks if it means my piece of clothing is not going to be next to disposable after a year.
text:Washing a few times before returning? What place would allow that?	labels:Nordstrom, actually. I have only done this once, but I returned a bra I had worn and then washed before returning.

The boots arrived last week and I'm fairly happy with them and proud of my decisiveness but now there's snow and ice on the ground so I'll be opting for my real winter boots more ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è   For me this is very much about my relationship with money as much as it is about being a mindful shopper. As a lifetime sales section shopper I've never dropped $200+tax on boots before, but I realized I'm actually in a place where financially I'm able to do so once in awhile without stressing my budget/responsibilities. It's weird to say but I felt such a relief when the boots arrived (and fit!).   I also think boredom has a role in this for me as well. I've spent so many nights this pandemic scrolling through online shops, Poshmark, marketplace etc looking for The One item. I really, really need to balance time spent on the search with time spent on other more fruitful projects.

text:Are our ideas about what looks ‚Äúdated‚Äù on either ourselves or others affected by or correlated with our age?	labels:My favorite comment about being dated is [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/hxpp50/What_are_signs_that_someone%E2%80%99s_style_hasn%E2%80%99t_changed_in_10_or_20_years%3F_Do_you_consider_that_a_problem%3F/fz8z0qk/) from a past post.  >This can be a really hard question to answer without offending people - anyone who provides specific examples will be met with: *"well, it's not dated when I style it,"* or *"Noooo but I love x and I will never stop wearing it but also don't want to be dated,"* or *"Who even cares if what you are wearing is dated?"* So instead I'm going to potentially offend everyone by trying to break down what is happening here.   >**What are the merits of not-looking-dated v. what are the merits of not caring?**  >If you opt out of caring about what is or is not fashionable, you are psychologically freeing yourself from the pressure of having to meet what may seem like arbitrary standards. However, you also have to be the kind of person who doesn't mind being judged for this decision or being perceived as someone who is not entirely with the times.   >On the other hand, some people opt into wanting to seem with-the-times because it removes the psychological pressure of judgement for not fitting in. Or maybe they really enjoy the trend cycle, and like that styles change frequently because they find it fun to indulge in new looks. However, they may feel a lot more pressure to keep up with things, spend more money, and be judged by people for being frivolous/buying into wasteful trend cycles.   >Align yourself with whatever viewpoint you want.  >**How can I wear beloved item x that people say is dated without looking dated?**  >This is called wanting to have your cake and eat it too.  >One option is to align yourself with Camp A above, accept that you are wearing something dated, and accept that you do not care. This means that if people say what you are wearing is dated, you don't cry "nooooo!". Instead, you just say, "lol okay, but I like it". Analyze the thing you like, understand WHY you like it, and if that is worth being perceived as dated. Maybe it is.  >Another option is to branch out and try new things. Are you sure that you hate the new style that has replaced old style? Or are you just having a knee jerk reaction? Maybe you look really good in the new style and don't know it yet!   >And maybe you've heard that "trendiness" and "style" are different things, and that you can be "stylish" without being on trend. That is true - but also be aware that having a "style" that is not "on trend" can be polarising as well. It's not a free ticket to having your cake and eating it too. This is an acceptable option. It comes with accepting that some people will think you look amazing, and other people will think you look ghastly.   >**What if the old style looks great on me and the new style looks terrible on me?**  >Make sure your eyes don't just need to adjust to the new silhouette. There's also never just one silhouette that is in style, so chances are there's a way to make the newer fashions work for you. Having the right body type for the old style does not automatically negate it being dated.  >**Thing x isn't dated where I live - and I haven't even seen anyone wearing new thing**  >Yeah, none of our experiences are monolithic. We have people posting here from all over the world, and the trends in Tokyo are not the same trends as in London or as in Dubai or as in New York. And then people in Auckland aren't even in the same season. And those are just big cities - even within the US people dress differently. Central PA is different than Western WA in terms of what people wear day-to-day. You know your own experience best, but it doesn't mean that what someone is reporting about *their* location is wrong. If your outfit is not dated where you live, then great! No one thinks you are dated. They may even think you look crazy for wearing some new trend that no one is wearing there yet. So you can choose whether to fit in with your surroundings, or follow fashion blogs from New York after weighing the pros and cons of both.  >**Who even cares if what you are wearing is dated?**  >Look, I don't LIKE all of this. I don't like that people love to be judgmental and categorize other people. But it is something that people do. Yeah, not giving a fuck gives you a certain type of power, but it also gives you certain deficits. Giving a fuck also gives you a certain type of power and gives you certain deficits.   >This is what being a woman is. It's running in circles trying to meet standards that came from ???   >Sometimes you're in that mood like, "What should I opt into this/care? I should do things for myself" and other times you are like, "Gah, I need to meet all societal expectations perfectly so that I don't feel bad about myself!"  >You can't win. A lot of people just pick an option and justify their choice with whatever makes them feel the best for their situation.   >**And what side, may I ask, are you on?**  >I oscillate between *"I'm going to wear comfy clothes because I have chronic pain, and my fear of the judgement of looking blah does not outweigh my physical discomfort in the moment,"* and *"I want to have a distinct personal style but one that adapts to the current silhouettes. I'm not necessarily achieving that, but it's an attempt."*

text:Pros and cons of an a capsule wardrobe?	labels:I have been wrestling with the idea of having a capsule wardrobe but I‚Äôve never done it because I find too many cons and I don‚Äôt think it would be suitable for my current lifestyle.  For me the cons are:  - hard to incorporate the clothing you already own. Capsule wardrobes work only if they are mainly made of solid color items (unless you like to mix and match prints) but many people already own plenty of good quality clothing that don‚Äôt fit a perfect capsule wardrobe project. What are people supposed to do with those?   - items tend to get ruined quicker. If you have fewer items you use them and wash them more often. This could cause your favorite items to get ruined quicker and, since the capsule is only made of high quality items, the replacements could end up being quite costly.  - it risks being boring. 90% of the capsule wardrobes you see online have mainly solid color (usually neutral color) items, with maybe a couple of printed items. This is not a style everyone likes. I am a big fan of prints and if I had a capsule wardrobe I wouldn‚Äôt be able to incorporate as much.   I truly wish to be able to rationalize my wardrobe more because now it is a little bit of a mess but a capsule wardrobe doesn‚Äôt seem to be the solution (at least right now) for me.	episode_done:True

text:Runways have been sending out 2000s vibes. Anyone onboard?	labels:It's interesting to me that everyone seems to have such a similar take on 00s fashion.  I'm white but "white girl fashion" wasn't the predominant look where I grew up.  In my specific area the look was either more 2000s urban fashion - timberlands, baby phat, fubu, sneakers, denim on denim on denim, camo (a la destinys child)... And then on the flip side, emo style. Emo became more popular in the mid-late 00s but vans, converse, creepers, studs, extreme side bangs - anything hot topic was also really big especially among those into the music before it got mainstream popular. The bitchy white girl look was never one that I saw on a daily basis. (born '88 btw)  There's enough comments here about low rise years so I won't go there. And while I think 00s was overall a cesspool for fashion, there are some trends I am wearing / can get behind mixing in with other stypes:   \- those ribbed cardigans with a single button or tie at the top   \- cargo pants (maybe if not for corona I wouldn't, but for now I'm here for this)   \- pastels    \- those sheer mesh tops (this is more 90s bleeding into 2000s.  I remember in the early 2000s having some with random glitter chinese symbols on them. I don't think that ages well in 2020)    \- flares - lets keep tailors in business.   Things I personally would pass on:   \- belts for absolutely no purpose   \- multiple tops for absolutely no purpose   \- hats, not for me   \- ruffled skirts    \- boot cut didnt look good on me when I was 12 and still doesn't

text:Can we talk sleepwear?	labels:When I prepared to give birth to my first child, I splurged on beautiful long sleeping gown / bathrobe set in white cotton.   It was comfy / flexible enough to accommodate my post-pregnancy recovery. But it was also luxurious and pretty - something that new mothers don't feel. (Also, my FIL was visiting & would often wander around with his camcorder! So I couldn't just walk around in my maternity undies).  I wore that set for more than 5 years.  I also have PJs that are button-down tops with matching little shorts. What makes the difference is high-quality cotton, good tailoring and detailing .  One set is black with white piping. Another is lavender. The guy I've been talking to (mostly via video) loves the black set, even though it's not overtly sexual like lingerie.  I don't wear anything silky to bed because it bunches up & also feels OTT.   Confession: I also "steal" hotel slippers because they are so comfy.

text:How do you think access and privilege affect your taste and sense of style?	labels:Definitely. For me, this became super evident in college. My first roommate (we didn‚Äôt last long together) only had one hobby and that was going shopping with her mother, which she did a couple weekends each month. I could not fathom that because I grew up in a poor family where we got new clothes like twice a year and they were all cheap and poor quality. I didn‚Äôt really have a chance to develop ‚Äústyle‚Äù until I could afford it, and even now at 27 I feel like I‚Äôm behind where I should be. Like, I enjoy fashion in theory, and I know what I like on other people, but I don‚Äôt even know where to BUY clothes other than Target/JC Penney/etc. since I‚Äôm scared of spending too much money on a sweater and it falling apart in the wash, or a skirt that ends up not looking good on me the way it looks on someone else.   I‚Äôve read SO many Reddit threads that are like ‚Äúwhat brands are actually worth the money?‚Äù and the answers are always ‚ÄúI love brand x‚Äù with someone else replying ‚Äútheir quality has gone way downhill in the past few years IMO.‚Äù And then I just don‚Äôt buy anything.   I think a lot of it comes down to me being afraid of taking risks now since I didn‚Äôt have the opportunity to try lots of different things as a teenager.
text:I grew up in a similar way. My mother-in-law has impeccable style and tastes, and based on how she dresses and furnishes her home, I thought she was a lot wealthier than she is. She is the one who introduced me to TJ Maxx/Marshall‚Äôs/HomeGoods family of stores...designer stuff at steep discounts. Some of it is really great deals, some isn‚Äôt, some quality is great and some is lower quality, but it‚Äôs awesome. There‚Äôs constantly revolving inventory and it‚Äôs a little like a treasure hunt. Sounds like maybe that might be a store you could go look around.	labels:It‚Äôs funny, but I dislike Marshall‚Äôs/Winners etc. while liking thrift stores.

I think it‚Äôs magic, it matches with everything somehow.

text:What have people actually worn to funerals you've been to?	labels:It depends.  Black, usually. I personally think the more business formal the better, to show respect for the deceased.

text:That is so beautiful. Once, I was in a store that specialized in these kinds of garments. There was a small group of Indian women there, and while I was looking they kept encouraging me to try one on. I found this one that was a crystal-like blue, and when I came out of the dressing room, the ladies were all very encouraging. I had blonde hair and blue eyes, and it really set my eyes off.  I felt so beautiful! But I just couldn't buy it, for a lot of reasons.

text:What‚Äôs your everyday purse?	labels:I have several because I am purse promiscuous.  I change it up based on mood, outfit, and what I need for the day.   Day to day I have the typical keys, wallet (alternate a card holder and a mid-sized one, hand sanitizer, lotion, pen, mini notebook, mask, and other odds and ends. If I am walking around a lot I‚Äôll add a water bottle. But it is not always needed.  I also like to have a scarf or cardigan in transitional weather. And of course and umbrella as needed, so that might push me to a bigger bag.   These are what I am reaching for in quarantine.   1. Fuchsia Coach [Rambler](https://www.coach.com/coach-rambler-crossbody/89127.html). Holds enough. And I like the glove tanned leather. I was getting sick of my black bags with my bland loungewear so this brightens my day!   2. LV Mabillon [Backpack](https://www.fashionphile.com/louis-vuitton-epi-mabillon-backpack-black-595025). I had a minimal black leather backpack on my wishlist for a year. And one day I was out and saw a woman with this one. I became obsessed.  And it is a 20 year old discontinued bag. I looked around resale for a few weeks to find a gold hardware one in gold condition. I scored one on Poshmark that looked hardly used and was holding its shape. I need to take myself to the LV store to get a replacement key for the lock one of these days. This is compact so it doesn‚Äôt hold a bottle. It does better with the card holder over my bigger wallet, but it is super light. And works with gym clothes and a dressier outfit. Also the branding is very minimal.   3. Lotuff Large [Tripp](https://lotuffleather.com/products/the-braided-tripp). I grabbed this last year as a b-day gift for myself. I did a custom one with contrast lining for fun. I do not typically like built in cars slots, but I wanted something bigger than a wallet on chain, that would be good on a trip and day to day. This fits the bill. It is not so compartment heavy I get annoyed. Works great for skipping the wallet as there is an obvious place for your bills and change. It is made in the US but doesn‚Äôt feel too rustic. Fits my kindle.  And if I use my slim water bottle that can work too. Also works as a clutch. And the braiding makes it interesting. But I usually just use it crossbody mode.   And in normal times, a few more bags go in the rotation for everyday.  * Dooney Pod [Backpack](https://www.dooney.com/pebble-grain-zip-pod-backpack-R0973CA.html) - I have this in a Grey lizard. Works well for most outfits that aren‚Äôt athleisure. And holds a large water bottle easily!   * Ferragamo Sophia [in Black](https://www.bragmybag.com/salvatore-ferragamo-sofia-bag/). This was my work bag before I needed to take my laptop home several years ago. I have the small bag which is not small. It easily fits a scarf, umbrella, and water bottle. And any sized wallet I want. It adds polish and doesn‚Äôt look crazy with jeans. The pebbled leather keeps it casual and slouchy.  And if you want to make an impulse trip to Neimans, the sales reps treat you nicely! This bag is also super well made, I can‚Äôt fathom it looking worn. I think mine is 7 years old, and the only wear is basically the indentations from the buckle on the crossbody strap and a few minor scratches on the hardware.   * Coach [Urbane](https://coach.tingtingchen.com/coach-product.php?name=URBANE%20SHOULDER%20BAG%202%20IN%20PEBBLED%20LEATHER&style=COACH%20f32504&color=LIGHT%20GOLD/BLACK). This bag came out in what I think of as an ‚ÄúOld Celine‚Äù phase. This was about the same time as the beginning of Philo getting a lot of press for the wearable styles. I have had this bag I think for 8 years. It is time to send it off to the purse spa, just to get the piping redone on the strap. It has no wear other than that an a bit of fading on the Coach gold foil logo. It is super minimal. And really sturdy. I used it for clubbing when I did that. And it is a Mary Poppins bag that can hold a sweater or a water bottle or scarf. And sometimes two of those. And it is really comfy. This is one of the purses I‚Äôll never part with. Still looks chic many years later. And doesn‚Äôt need to be babied. 100% recommend.

Incredibly helpful. The quality isn‚Äôt amazing, but with that being said, I‚Äôve had a basic cropped long sleeve I wear regularly hold strong for a year now with no tears or pilling, etc. it‚Äôs been quite durable, and I don‚Äôt have to iron it nor does it wrinkle easily so there‚Äôs that.  Something else that‚Äôs interesting, when I went to place a request for a return on some pants and a shirt I was told to keep them. I was refunded and didn‚Äôt have to ship anything back which is convenient, but I still didn‚Äôt want the pieces so now I guess I‚Äôll have to donate them which does feel kind of wasteful.	episode_done:True
text:What did people *actually* wear in 2000's?	labels:Low rise flares or bootcut jeans. I had one embroidered pair. Not a lot of light wash. Those tops with the sheer bell sleeves or fitted tees with "witty" sayings on them (super cringey looking back). Layered tees - long sleeve under short. Or short sleeve button up with long sleeve under. Sometimes there were tees with FAKE long sleeves so it looked layered.  VERY fitted polos - thin tee shirt material, hugged curves. I owned a lot of camis for layering, often with that shelf bra built in.   All the tops were longer than regular length are now (because pants were so low rise maybe?).   Tennis shoes all the time, often with a bit of a platform sole. Oh, I had chunky heeled black boots with a zipper that used to shred my tights when I walked.   The only skirts I really wore were those "broomstick skirts".  Gathered tiered layers of usually different colored/patterened fabric. You can simetimes fond similar things today but they are usually all one color. No. Crazy quilt skirts. They were popluar enough that some  fabric stores sold already gathered/sewn tiered fabric for them by the roll. I distincly remember wearing one to a party in 2005 or so.   I owned a suede newsboy type hat, but kind of puffier?  Later on there were a lot of vests for some reason. But that was probably 2007, 2008?	episode_done:True

But honestly, as someone whose style kind of stagnated somewhere in the mid 2010s, I kind of feel like this sub isn‚Äôt very helpful for updating my style, because the sub also refuses to catch up with what‚Äôs fashionable.  Like streetwear has obviously captured the zeitgeist for quite a while now. That‚Äôs always been an element of my wardrobe. But I feel like I could do better to expand my style and have more options and just in general better embrace trends and incorporate them into my own personal style.  But for the most part this sub isn‚Äôt really interested in keeping up. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm not expecting this sub to start going crazy for box logos or Supreme or dress like a futuristic cartoon character, if I was interested in that I would actually just read r/streetwear. But I do wish some of the recurring threads and users could offer some inspo in terms of tasteful, grown up streetwear outfits and things like that. But from my perception, MFA is still stuck in early 2010s menswear, J. Crew inspired Americana, or just outright standard business casual. Which is *fine*, it doesn‚Äôt look bad, but it‚Äôs certainly not fashionable anymore and despite that the default male fashion sub won‚Äôt look beyond it, largely.  EDIT: People have been asking me for examples, here‚Äôs some stuff that I‚Äôve liked lately, I don‚Äôt know that most or any of this is what you‚Äôd call ‚Äústreetwear‚Äù but it‚Äôs more in the direction of what I‚Äôm talking about   Thom Yorke is one of my consistently favorite style inspo sources, he pulls off a pretty good hybrid of tasteful streetwear and classic menswear style I think.  I like this kind of fit he‚Äôs worn a lot of the last couple years:   (Actually can‚Äôt find the exact pic I‚Äôm looking for here so I‚Äôll try my best here)  https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/theoaklandpress.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/1/4b/14bc5350-f6ff-11e8-8bd7-83eb124e2f8a/5c052f56b8ad2.image.jpg?resize=1200%2C800  Usually coupled with one of these Undercover jackets like this:  https://static.stereogum.com/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1161546807-1570042584-compressed.jpg  I think one of the pieces he wears a lot are the Acne Ryder pants, which I kind of like as hybrid classic menswear combined with a more informal, streetwear adjacent vibe:  https://www.nordstrom.com/s/acne-studios-ryder-slim-fit-pants/5146319  I also like Acne in general and I wish I could afford some of these jeans to work into some outfits I have kicking around in my head:  https://www.acnestudios.com/us/en/max-blue-black/B00146-AIL.html?categid=man-jeans  I also like Daniel Lopatin aka Oneohtrix Point Never‚Äôs style as well, who I‚Äôd say does kind of a more tasteful streetwear thing as well. This press pic is a nice example:  https://dazedimg-dazedgroup.netdna-ssl.com/1400/azure/dazed-prod/1230/9/1239834.jpg  More OPN with bonus Safdie brother: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DOn1aXWWsAAeZSC.jpg  I also like these black denim jackets, chore jackets kind of thing. I have a good Rag & Bone one that I‚Äôve gained too much weight to wear, but these 3sixteen and Rogue Territory ones are nice too and along those lines:  https://www.3sixteen.com/collections/outerwear/products/type-3s-denim-jacket-lightweight-double-black   https://www.rogueterritory.com/collections/jackets/products/supply-jacket-stealth-black?variant=5415637057568  Also along these lines, this Carhartt WIP jacket: https://stagprovisions.com/collections/carhartt-wip/products/carhartt-wip-modular-jacket-ss18  In general I like the use of black/muted or monochromatic colors, I like the idea of drawing influence from punk/hardcore style because I‚Äôm into that as well, but I haven‚Äôt figured out exactly how to make that work. Also for that reason, I‚Äôd like to replace my Red Wings with a pair of Docs, I like the rougher around the edges style better.  I‚Äôm gonna trying to keep editing this post, Reddit is kinda fucking up on my phone.
text:MFA cannot be everything to everyone. You have to consider that the original and primary intent of the sub is to provide advice for fashion beginners. The discussion and much of the outfits being shared will therefore lean towards the taste of beginners. "TIMELESS" is such a meme on this sub because it's one of the most used adjectives by newbies because they want something they can wear for as long as possible without putting additional effort into keeping up to date. Since that's the mindset of a majority of the userbase, then obviously you're not going to see much movement if you're only paying attention to the surface of the sub.   These complaints are always welcome though, because it reminds longer term users (and users at a more... "advanced" level) that there are other users who are genuinely interested in fashion as a hobby and want more than just the basics. But you're also misreading it as the sub's "fault" as opposed to the sub's "primary focus". If you spend any time actually conversing with the non beginners, you'll see significantly more variation in styles, and a lot of the thought that goes into people's styles. I'm pretty sure if you lined up all the mods in their favorite outfits, no two would look similar.   tl;dr you're only seeing the surface of mfa, and mfa is inherently a beginner's sub that's not interested in fashion, only dressing "well".   edit: might as well plug my [wardrobe post](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/fz6s8p/one_wardrobe_two_themes/).	labels:	episode_done:True

A lot of times I have friends who say it wouldn‚Äôt attract anyone, but I feel like the way I dress won‚Äôt attract everyone but it might be geared more towards women who have similar interests as me.

text:What have people actually worn to funerals you've been to?	labels:I haven't been to one in more than several years - it was a dressed up affair. I wore some sort of conservative dark colored dress and dress shoes. No panty hose, but that was an iffy decision. Older people wore hats as well. Definitely a lot of skirt suits.  During the pandemic, I went to a visual one - and the outfits were much the same, maybe a man had on khakis instead of dark pants.   I have some relatives who have requested no black at their funerals, and some want white. But it is definitely a no jeans occasion. If you were casual you would definitely be the talk of the church ladies.	episode_done:True

text:Future of fibers?	labels:Personally I don‚Äôt find it very difficult or expensive to shop for clothing made with natural fibers ‚Äî if anything it‚Äôs gotten even easier to do so with online shopping and websites showing fiber content right in the product description. I don‚Äôt have to seek out brands that specialize in natural materials either ‚Äî my clothing is mostly from Madewell, which doesn‚Äôt really market itself as being all that environmentally conscious or sustainable, and is definitely not a high end brand, but they have tons of options for clothing made of cotton, silk, etc.   I will say it‚Äôs gotten harder to find sweaters made of 100% wool over the years, however. I have several wool sweaters from mall brands that I bought just a few years ago. I gained some weight since then and have been looking for replacements from the same exact brands and it seems like they don‚Äôt even bother with 100% wool anymore, all of their sweaters are now made with acrylic, nylon, polyester, etc. That‚Äôs the only natural fiber that I feel has all but disappeared from the mainstream for some reason.   I will also add that I don‚Äôt think man made fibers are necessarily ‚Äúcheap‚Äù, either. We‚Äôve come a long way from man made materials of the 80s and 90s. When I think of man made fibers of today, I think of technical clothing and gear such as outdoor or sportswear. Patagonia for example is the poster child for environmentally friendly brands, but most of their clothing is made from man made materials, and their products are far from cheap. Partly because it performs better for its purpose, and partly because it‚Äôs supposed last a lifetime.  Which leads me to my last thought ‚Äî IMO man made materials aren‚Äôt necessarily bad for the environment. It‚Äôs really our habits that are bad, and the industries that cater to these habits. If we all bought a few items of clothing that were all man made and lasted our lifetime, that is arguably *more* environmentally friendly than if we were constantly buying and throwing away natural fibered clothing.
text:This is the point I came to make, IDK how people are having difficulty finding natural fibers, my entire wardrobe is 100% cotton and linen and I shop at like, Zara and H&M lmao.   Most jeans are sturdy 100% cotton these days, it's easy to find cotton t-shirts, cotton knits and stuff like that...I guess silk is the only one I haven't really seen, but even wool pops up here and there even though, I agree, it's harder to find.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do your clothes wear out?	labels:Maybe I‚Äôm lucky but I‚Äôve only ever had pieces from forever21 (when I shopped there when I was really young) and H&M fall apart. The sweaters would have pills pile up on within a few months of wear, and the rest of the clothes would shrink in the wash.	episode_done:True
text:What is your 2021 style resolution?	labels:I've noticed my choices of how to dress getting lazier and my passion for choosing a good outfit fading. This is due to be working at home, no restaurants, bars, meeting with friends, concerts...

text:Do you have a childhood fashion icon? If so, does their influence show up in your wardrobe today?	labels:Queen Amidala 100%.

I don't know how much influence *her* particular style has on my wardrobe now, but I'm heavily influenced by fantasy and science fiction themes overall and am very much "more is more" when it comes to detail and exaggeration.

text:Shitpost Saturday: Fashion is dead. This is now a house plant subreddit.	labels:My spiderplant is the MLM of houseplants. It keeps growing. I have 5 generations in various pots. I nurture the little babies in recycled go-go coffee cups and old candle jars. Whenever someone does me a favor, wants a plant, buys a house and needs a housewarming gift - boom, spider plant. Don't want one? Too bad, here's a spider plant.  I also have a schefflera, which I think some of them are called umbrella plants. The little tag says it can grow up to 6 feet so I have taken it to be my personal challenge to grow this sucker as much as I can.  The other ones I have are an unscientific result of trial and error. I buy random little 2-4" inch potted plants and do my best to take care of them. If they grow, I keep doing whatever I've been doing and assume they're fine, lol. If they don't grow, I change tactics and try to bring it back, but if it doesn't make it, welp, wasn't meant to be.  I've tried at 3 least times and I can't keep African violets alive.  My biggest plant caveat is that I will not bring in anything poisonous to my cats. I do enough googling in a store to determine if I feel safe maintaining it at home. Anything like lilies, for example, are an absolute no-go because even a small amount of their pollen and dust can be dangerous to them.
text:Oh, my staghorn ferns are like this. I have something like 16 plants, but only purchased 4 of them.   Except I never give them away because I'm too emotionally attached to my babies.

text:Primaloft is good stuff. I've got it in a Patagonia puffer and a J. Crew jacket. Both are much warmer than their weights would indicate.  Fleece is not as warm, all things told, though of course it depends on the exact fleece.  Some (many) people prefer all natural fibers over synthetics. I was one of them, but I'm phasing animal products out of my wardrobe. I find that higher-quality synthetics work as well or nearly as well for my needs as wool, but that low-quality synthetics mostly stink.	labels:What are some fleece pieces that are stylish and warm?

text:What are your thoughts on outfit repeating multiple days in a row?	labels:I don't repeat outfits two days in a row, but I will do something like the following for a work week:  * Day 1: top A, bottom A, shoes A * Day 2: top B, bottom A, shoes B * Day 3: dress A, shoes A * Day 4: top A, bottom B, shoes B * Day 5: dress B, shoes A  I find I can wear bottoms (skirt or trousers) twice in a row without anyone noticing, as long as they are pretty plain, but tops are harder both because they're closer to eye level and also because of underarm sweat; I live in Florida, so sweat is a consideration most of the year.  My clothes may not be *dirty* after two wears, but wearing them a third day is probably pushing it in terms of olfactory offense risk.  I have a personal rule to never wear the same pair of shoes two days in a row if at all possible, since shoes tend to wear better if you give them a rest day between wearings.

text:I know ‚Äúfashion‚Äù but people of minorities are always forced to try better. Some Insights	labels:I'm Asian, not black, but this reminds me of something I've consciously learned to do in my career, to try to actively contradict stereotypes in order to encourage colleagues to actually engage with me as an individual with my own strengths, weaknesses, and personality. In the U.S., stereotypes aren't nearly as harmful for Asians as they are for black men, but in the workforce I've seen a lot of Asians plateau at the lower level, informal team lead positions, while getting stuck being hidden away when it comes time to build relationships or manage long-term, strategic goals.  I've played up my blue collar background in order to disarm the "nerd" stereotype, and I've played up my military background as necessary to remind people that I have management and leadership experience, and that I'm not just the guy hired to be some technical specialist, or the one-off task. It's also an easy way to connect with other vets.   Early in my white collar career, I retained my military haircut, maintained a stronger (rather than a leaner/cardio-friendly) build, because from what I've seen, a bit of a subconscious bias about blue collar = power lifter while white collar = weekend marathoner.  Now that I've climbed the ladder a bit I've been able to back off some, and adopt a bit more of the style and look of a mid-career white collar professional (but in a fashion-conscious way). I've also gotten older so I haven't hit my strength (or my cardio) goals in a while, and I look more like a white collar professional that way, too.   And maybe I'm overthinking things, but I found that leaning into meathead or combat vet stereotypes allowed me to avoid being pigeonholed like so many other Asians who came before me. So this linked study at least seems roughly analogous to what I had already seemingly experienced, albeit in a very different context with very different considerations.
text:You're doing a lot of same things Black people are doing.  You're just not cognizant of the fact because you're looking at it from your personal point of view.  It is literally the same thing, Asians just have their own flavor that needs to be assimilated into the American status quo in order to get ahead.	labels:> You're doing a lot of same things Black people are doing.

My problem with Champion and Adidas is that the pants don't last more than 6-9 months even though it's affordable, however Alphalete and Gymshark likely won't last more than 2 years (have had two pairs of each for almost a year and they're already fraying in the groin region) but is more than double the price of the other two.  For reference, I powerlift, run, and play soccer and volleyball year-round 6-7 days a week.

text:oh pls report back if you like them! are they super comfy as advertised?	labels:Honestly.... I was not blown away. The website makes it sound like you‚Äôll be walking on memory foam, so I was pretty surprised by how hard and solid the soles actually felt. Also, I‚Äôm not someone who needs at ton of arch support. My go to work shoe is my Rothys, notorious for having zero arch support. So the exaggerated arch support in the boots felt like there was a wad of paper stuck in the shoe. Finally, I ordered true to size but they felt tight across the toes. They were better by the end of the day, but I think it will still take a few wears to really break in. That being said, my feet didn‚Äôt hurt at the end of the day (they usually don‚Äôt though). Also I got a TON of compliments on them. I think advertising them as a super comfy shoe is misleading. I think it would be way more appropriate to advertise them as a very orthopedicly supportive and corrective shoe. If you have foot problems, buying full price /might/ be worth it. If you don‚Äôt have foot problems, buying them at a very steep discount is worth it. But honestly I think I find my Frye boots more comfortable than Taryn Rose. Still, for $40, I‚Äôm very happy with them. I also ordered the heels, so I‚Äôll let you know what I think about those as well!	episode_done:True

It's been tough--I think I've returned 90% of the things I've ordered.   The pandemic has made things harder for me, though.

I agree about it being hard to decide what will fit, especially because I used to shop solely at 2-3 stores but I've been trying to branch out and try different brands. Something that has helped limit me buy is that I made a list in January of things I wanted to buy, it's changed a little from January but I think that's helped me not go overboard when I buy things on-line.

text:Viberg Natural Shell & Grey Kangaroo - A quick update & pictures.	labels:[Current Album](https://imgur.com/a/LkgWwV7)  Cleaned these up this morning and thought I'd post a few pictures. Still my most worn pairs and still the best looking in my collection. Had the kangaroos for a little over 2.5 years and the shell for 2 years.   These have been in rotation with the [hatchgrain shell sidezips](https://www.instagram.com/p/B9u8BX2J7vU/) the last year. All the pairs have been worn hard and have been through sun, rain, snow and salt. In my experience there is no better leather than shell for hard wear. So much easier to keep clean and get some shine on if needed. Kangaroo on the other hand is fairly thin and my feet got cold in the winters here in MN even with thicker socks. Also the water soaks through the leather fairly easily.  I might start using them more in the warmer months.  Haven't used any product on these in the last year. Just some damp cloth or a wet wipe to clean the dirt and some brushing.   To conclude, I dont think there is a better pair to go with denim. Both natural and grey/olive/brown kangaroo look amazing with jeans which I wear 95% of the time.  For folks seeing these for the first time, [here](https://imgur.com/a/G4euu) are some pictures of the kangaroos when new. They started grey.

text:How do I improve my fashion sense beyond just tshirt and jeans?	labels:I used Pinterest like another commenter said and just pinned every outfit I could see myself wearing. After doing that for awhile, I wrote down some pieces I saw repeating throughout. Leather jacket, tan suede jacket, loose white v-neck, high-waisted button fly jeans, etc. From there I did some googling and started to find higher end pieces that would last. I also used LIKEtoKnow.it to see how bloggers were styling them. Then made a Pinterest board for the actual products I intended to purchase and bought things as I could afford them.  I got really into capsule wardrobe idea, too, and did a lot of research there. I like elevating basics with good quality shoes and higher end delicate accessories (not expensive, but mid-range)‚Äîinvesting in those makes everything look more put together. I find it‚Äôs best to have fewer clothes and know how to wear them in different ways than tons and tons of individual pieces. More clothes ‚â† better.	episode_done:True

text:Does anyone else use a ‚Äúformula‚Äù to create their outfits?	labels:I used to follow a lot of formulas and guidelines, but as I documented my outfits (and started seeing other people document theirs), I found that [listening to my lizard overlord](https://www.instagram.com/p/CIlhWoCFiWx/) made me a lot happier. Here are some things my lizard overlord likes for now. I'm sure this will change:  * Comfort first - nothing itchy, restrictive, or painful. This is my most important "rule". * Colors/patterns - I love combining different colors and/or patterns, but they need to have something in common in order for me to like them together, e.g. both patterns have a similar color or the colors are a similar shade. I have always hated wearing pastels/neons and tend to prefer jewel tones or earth tones (although I don't usually like mixing them together). * Statement pieces - I tend to prefer minimalist or maximalist combinations although I can't dress quite as maximalist as I would like due to the limitations of my wardrobe. * Silhouette - I tend to like all pieces form fitting or all relaxed. I have a weird hang up when it comes to skinny jeans w/ oversized tops but am perfectly fine w/ the combo of straight leg jeans with an oversized top or a form fitting top w/ skinny jeans. * Feminine/masculine - I like feminine elements to outfits but tend to combine them with something more gender neutral. For example, if I wear a white dress with lace on it, I'll pair it with black combat boots.  EDIT: Thanks for all the love, but I am not u/FriskyGatos \- just a huge fan. I guess my post wasn't clear in that I was citing her ideas rather than posting my own IG.

Like wearing white shoes and single colored shirts and nike clothes in general. Like they pair pants and short shorts with white sneakers. They accessorize with ray bans or a cross and have the fade hairstyle (long on the top). I call it college/instagram guy/tik tok guy basic fashion for pretty boys. In contrast, my closet has NASA shirts, shirts with anime characters, classic GAP text t-shirts.  Can you guys teach me how to dress like that.

text:How do you guys work towards avoiding fast fashion?	labels:I‚Äôve started moving toward nicer/non-fast fashion basics on ebay, as actual thrifting isn‚Äôt something I can physically do right now. I keep my eye out for mainly black tees, pants in certain silhouettes, and sweaters in natural fibers (especially wool and linen). I‚Äôm embracing an early retirement (30s) due to poor health with a love for Eileen Fisher basics. Not being able to work has changed the type of clothing I wear, and having little cash is complicated. Because my feet are super messed up, I wear quality not-cute shoes, and have found pairs of new-in-box Alegria shoes I‚Äôve had my eye on for half off.  Some brands are starting to take back their own clothes and resell what they can at a discount‚ÄîEileen Fisher and I think Patagonia are what‚Äôs on my radar but they‚Äôre not the only ones. Between these and ebay I‚Äôm loving second-hand shopping for the first time ever because it‚Äôs so much less overwhelming/exhausting/disappointing.  When I got a new job a few years ago the dress code was on the more business side of business casual than my background (academia, nonprofit) so I had to do a quick wardrobe update. What helped me out was having nondescript basics (mainly 2-3 washable black sheaths) with several cardigans in different styles and colors. I think it‚Äôs tough to manage multiple wardrobe shifts at once! It may help to focus on what you need to change for work, because that might go through a few edits before it clicks. Then you can look for more lasting/sustainable pieces.	episode_done:True

text:Thoughts on Shein?	labels:Controversial opinion, but, they aren‚Äôt that bad.   Let‚Äôs have some empathy for a moment: it is an absolute privilege to be able to shop at a sustainable store and/or to be able to buy secondhand. Imagine being someone who hasn‚Äôt bought new to them clothing in years because they can‚Äôt afford to and then fast fashion prices are waved in their faces on clothing that fits them and is their style. I‚Äôm not going to tell someone to not buy clothing from a place they can afford. I‚Äôm absolutely not doing it.   People demonize fast fashion because they look at it as black and white and don‚Äôt understand that, if you‚Äôre shopping at SHEIN, you likely can‚Äôt afford the more sustainable sources/you can‚Äôt find what you‚Äôre looking for secondhand. I‚Äôm plus sized. I can‚Äôt fit into and afford a lot of the sustainable brands out there. And, people buy out the ‚Äúfashionable‚Äù plus size items in my local thrift stores to sell on Depop, so, I don‚Äôt blame people for shopping on SHEIN.  I‚Äôve bought SHEIN secondhand and I‚Äôve had items for years and I haven‚Äôt had any issues. I haven‚Äôt bought first hand from them in a long time but when I did, I never had any long shipping times or anything, either. I found the same defects I‚Äôd find at Target, like, a long thread here or there that I can easily snip off.   This goes for fast fashion in general‚Äîif you take care of your clothes and wear the appropriate size, you can make them last. It‚Äôs not like they spontaneously rip apart, you have to do something to make them do that. Steam your clothes to get out wrinkle. Tumble dry, hand wash, etc.
text:You raise good points, but I‚Äôm going to respectfully disagree - I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs ever any valid excuse to buy from a company who openly profits from exploitative third world labour. We can all do better.   Sustainable fashion is expensive, yes. But *usually* buying quality clothing is cheaper in the long run than buying lots of cheap stuff (I know this is easier said than done for people living hand to mouth).   Secondly there are options that don‚Äôt exploit people. Namely second hand shops and Depop. I guarantee - no matter what the item is - someone‚Äôs already bought it or something VERY similar and wants to get rid of it. Even when I have money I buy from there because... why wouldn‚Äôt you?   The ‚Äúwhat about poor people‚Äù argument always gets made but it just doesn‚Äôt sit right with me. What about the people who are being paid 40p a day in sweltering and unsafe Bangladeshi factories? Factories that are dumping toxic dyes into water sources? We all have a responsibility not to perpetuate the monolithic success of these horrible fast fashion conglomerates.	labels:Second hand sites are great, I definitely use them a lot (well, I'm trying for a no-buy/low-buy in 2021, but second hand is first choice when I do shop) BUT there are iffy practices there too. I personally know several people, and have watched and learned through different youtube behind-the-shop videos, that its a relatively common practice to go to fast fashion stores, buy cheap items, put them up for sale, knowing you might just break even or even net a loss for that item, but luring customers in. They come for the trendy crop-top hoodie with tags still on it, and then end up buying bundle deals or whatever. So its not always a matter of "this item was going to be thrown away. " It is not uncommon for it to be "this item was purchased new in order to drive up interest in the shop." Successful resellers manipulate emotions as much as the rest of fast fashion. They know people want their trendy stuff but don't want to feel guilty about it, so they've tapped that market...this isn't to say **all** resellers, of course. But second-hand is still a business and its not always as clear cut as we'd like...	episode_done:True

text:"freeing the titty" when you don't have "fashion boobs"?	labels:Pre-quarantine, I would wear a bra for work and sometimes on weekends as a habit, though I preferred to go without on weekends.  I‚Äôm a 32F, though I‚Äôve worn (and been sized as) 32DDD/E and 32G as well. So I totally get it. My boobs sag, it‚Äôs pretty noticeable (to me at least). My bra boobs sit much higher. And my waist isn‚Äôt very defined on its own, only 2 inches less than my ribs.  Random people on the street don‚Äôt know what my bra boobs look like though, so that‚Äôs a freebie. And my friends probably don‚Äôt care, or if they do, they haven‚Äôt said anything.  A bralette helps a little, at least contains them as a unit rather than both free to do whatever they want. Likewise with any tight fitting shirts/dresses. But a lot of the time I just let them be free. If I really think what I‚Äôm wearing looks hideous, I‚Äôll put on a bra or just wear something else. But usually it looks fine and it‚Äôs just a matter of getting used to the idea of where the boobs naturally sit.

text:What are your favorite, trusted clothing lines for buying wear-forever investment classics?	labels:I think shoes in general are expected to hold up longer than tops, and a lot of the time you get what you pay for with luxury purchases (not always of course).  I got nice cashmere sweaters, hats and scarves from Naadam that I've had for a couple of years with no issues (I only found out about the brand then, so I can't speak on quality over decades, but the seams and everything look solid and nothing has pilled or lost shape with regular handwashing). The stuff I got there is also not itchy at all, and I'm sensitive to that (especially with hats, can't stand an itchy forehead)  I also have a few M.Gemi sneakers that have held up a few years (including all white ones that are very easy to clean and look great after frequent wear for 2 years)  My silk and cotton shirts from Sezane have held up great, but then again, I hand wash and air dry all my nice tops, so a lot of it is upkeep, not just the initial quality of the garment. I got a couple of great wool sweaters there as well, haven't tried their signature blend sweaters (my mom was against blended fabrics and - gasp - polyester when I was growing up and it rubbed off on me somewhat). My Sezane leather ankle boots are also nice and held up great, but I returned a different style (lace up boots) one time because it seemed cheap so YMMV.  I have a few great things from Madewell and Jcrew, but they were purchased a few years ago and I read on here that the quality went down, so not sure about current stuff.  TLDR Naadam, M.Gemi, Sezane have been good in my experience but upkeep is very important and will determine how fast an item wears out.
text:I've noticed lots of retailers, including Sezane and Everlane, releasing more alpaca fiber knits and less merino wool/cashmere knits.

Polyester makes me sweat like crazy, and I've been trying to switch my clothes all to more natural fibers where possible.  Looking at their catalogue today I'm seeing a lot of Rayon and Viscose, which is better, but there's not a lot that catches my fancy.  I also miss the indie designers! I hate how if you're not into whatever is considered mainstream fashion for that season that it's really difficult to find items that are both accessible and stylistically different than anything else on the rack. For me, Modcloth used to fit that gap, especially since most (all?) of their styles extended into plus sizes.

As for makeup, start with just wearing a little- Brow gel, Concealer, Lipgloss/Lipstick. There‚Äôs loads of brands out there including affordable ones.

For example, I knew I was ready to invest in some high end Chelsea boots when I found myself going through a cheap pair every year. Or to invest in a nice leather-looking jacket when I found myself grabbing mine 70% of the time I went out.  The expensive items were hard to wear at first, maybe on date nights or to a nicer event, but as I got more used to wearing them I wore them more often. I think it took me a hot year before I wore my Red Wings more than like once a month.   My recommendation is keep the items in your comfort zone (so no wild dresses or Colors at first) and to force yourself to wear it at a regular interval. These days, just wearing nice jeans while I go shopping seems to be my ‚Äúdate night‚Äù when I dress up!
text:That‚Äôs a really good idea, buying cheap versions and seeing what you rewear. Can‚Äôt believe I haven‚Äôt thought of that.   The thing that I want to spend money on is leather lined shoes, especially chukka boots. But I also teach elementary school. All day, they step on my feet and it destroys my shoes. So I don‚Äôt want to spend more than $100 if 7 year olds are just gonna wreck them.	labels:You should absolutely get all leather items pretreated.  I never knew the miracles this has on leather goods.  You will increase the lifespan of the item by 10.  Game changer	episode_done:True
text:What did people *actually* wear in 2000's?	labels:Mean Girls fashion was scary accurate to what I wore in high school, just replace the heels with $2 old navy flip flops.  Flounce mini skirts and asymmetric longer skirts in hideous geometric prints, way too long tank tops (worn under polos and low cut tops), juicy couture, stupid phrases on tees, too tight zip up hoodies, fake Louis Vuitton multicolor pouchettes, soccer mom cardigans that definitely did not look good on my non-Regina George looking ass.  But because I was an actual teenager and not a character in a movie I also wore flare and bootcut jeans with bad whiskering, chunky skater shoes, oversized men‚Äôs hoodies, comic book shirts from the target boys department, bad polyester h&m/f21 tops that actually did start falling apart after a few washes, tops with cheap sequin embellishments, Paul frank, a lot of surf brand tshirts from pacsun, and clothes from the limited made for women ten years older than me (low key miss the limited tho).  Laguna Beach was another great example of teen beach fashion in the ‚Äò00s. I had a Melie Bianco bag because of LC.

text:Revisiting Fall Favorites: Barbour Jackets pt 3	labels:Barbour jackets have negative connotations in some social circles in the UK because of their middle class association (note British definition of middle class, not American!).

text:Your thoughts on leopard print (and animal prints in general)	labels:I‚Äôve had a very similar leopard print awakening lol but I‚Äôve been going more accessories side with it- a pair of flats and a square scarf. This past year I‚Äôve really come around to it. I‚Äôm still picky about it, I think there are a lot of weird looking patterns out there, but now I want to try and find a maxi leopard print skirt too lol. To add to your list of things to pair it with, a white tee under a blue denim jacket sounds like a great casual look.  I‚Äôm still not into other animal prints (god, seeing zebra print reminds me of so many people I went to high school with) and I don‚Äôt see that changing anytime soon. I‚Äôm more florals or novelty prints myself (I have a cute, cheap bird print skirt that I love, it‚Äôs like the birds are straight out of a nature trails field guide), but I don‚Äôt think friends or coworkers would see me any differently if I wore leopard print as long as it was tasteful. I doubt they would notice unless they wanted the piece of clothing themselves lol. Leopard print has worked its way to becoming more of a classic, much more than zebra print has, and snakeskin/snake print is similar in terms of bags/purses and boots, I think.
text:I wanted to add that leopard print, when done right, feels very indulgent to me. Looking at a bunch of different kinds of leopard print skirts on amazon (lol) and most of them look cheesy and very silly, usually because something is ‚Äúoff‚Äù- size of the spots are too big, not the right shape/shading, or the style of the skirt is very 2000‚Äôs lol. That or it‚Äôs the electric blue/bright colors leopard print oh gosh I had forgotten about that. So, when I see leopard print and I think ‚Äúindulgent‚Äù I think I‚Äôm finally seeing what everyone else who loves leopard print is seeing- a pattern that really vibes lol. I think it can be a good neutral and I‚Äôll probably keep wearing it unless it gets ‚Äúruined‚Äù for me by some trend or something (similar to OP‚Äôs comment about leopard print associated with specific characters/tropes in the 00‚Äôs)	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Men‚Äôs clothing	labels:I'm similar in size to you although I identify my fashion as masculine of center so I almost exclusively wear "menswear"! What I've found that helps me the most is having all of my measurements saved on my phone and then comparing that to size guides to see how it stacks up. I don't typically wear men's/boy's jeans or pants because the fit is usually too bulky/baggy for my tastes. I'm actually a bit shorter than you at 5'0 feet so I've also found that boys' clothing that isn't too juvenile usually works very well. I own boys' clothing from Old Navy and J Crew but honestly places like Zara, H&M, etc. work well too if you're okay buying fast fashion.  You could also try Topman and ASOS who make XXXS and XXS men's sizes in certain fits and I've had good luck getting their sweaters in what they call a "muscle fit" which is supposed to fit men very tightly but fits me perfectly. There are also a good handful of queer brands who make clothing exclusively for androgynous or more masculine tastes. I would recommend checking out Dapper Boi, Kirrin Finch, Peau Du Loup, Wildfang (very expensive and some recent drama with underpaying BIPOC) and TomboyX if you're looking for more masculine underwear too.	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - October 23	labels:I gotta say, as an American, it's really surprising that there's class connotations to rugby shirts. On paper, rugby should be an "everyman" sport like soccer, basketball, football, baseball, etc. with the barrier to entry just being a ball and a field. Seems really out of place for it to be paired up with golf, tennis, and horse-related stuff.
text:Rugby Union is a middle and upper class sport associated with fee paying schools in England (and Scotland to some extent).  The working class version is Rugby League. There was a schism in the late 1800s over the payment of wages to players and the dominance of London and the South East of England in the RFU. The working class sport went in an entirely different direction.   Union is the prominent version in culture, and the big money one too and a lot of English support and players still come from the wealthy South East and private fee paying schools.  Slightly different in Wales where we kept playing Union, and it's essentially our national sport and very working class but we're an outlier in the UK on that.  Of course, Ireland (and Ulster) is even more complicated because of, well, the sectarian thing.  But rugby shirts tend to get seen heavily around the big Spring and Autumn tournaments and worn by a very particular kind of English man (and Scotsman, Welshman etc), that is both a class thing and also a kind of macho laddish thing. Here in Wales rugby culture is heavy drinking, men down the club thing and not exactly friendly to women, LGBT etc.  There's also the national thing, Wales' single greatest sporting achievement in my lifetime in popular culture probably isn't winning the Tour de France or making it really far in euro 2016. It's knocking England out of the rugby world cup they were hosting at their home stadium. We all love to hate England rugby fans too. The England rugby team represent a lot of what the Welsh resent about England for lots of reasons.  When we were in Japan for the World Cup last year I thought my wife was going to tear apart the loud England fan who was supporting Fiji over us three seats away.	labels:That makes sense. My father-in-law is really into rugby, in all forms, and has all the obscure sports packages for TV to be able to record basically every single match on earth. He very well might have been on the US national team in his 20s... but tryouts were on his wedding day. Ended up being the club team advisor for about a decade at the university he taught at instead.  He's never brought up this stuff at all.	episode_done:True

text:[Serious answers only] FAQ: Why does runway fashion looks like nothing you'd ordinarily wear on the daily?	labels:Completely unqualified to answer this but as an outsider to the industry looking in I always assumed that runway fashion was just an art form and fashion shows are essentially like a gallery exhibition.   I always bite my tongue when crazy over the top runway stuff is posted because I assume people are respecting the artistic view and not the practicality of use/wear. Obviously it‚Äôs good for people to be exposed to art outside of their wheelhouse so it‚Äôs encouraged that runway stuff be allowed in this sub but I‚Äôm glad this was posted as I feel this needs addressed and defined for the guys like me not interested in designers and we just want to look good for the people around us.   If we are going to host the entire spectrum of fashion on this sub we need some kind of classification system for noobs like me and clear definitions of what‚Äôs really going on with that type of fashion. It‚Äôs taken me years to be able to deal with figuring out the nuances and we could save so many guys like me a lot of time (and downvotes) by delving into this line of questioning.
text:>Completely unqualified to answer this but as an outsider to the industry looking in I always assumed that runway fashion was just an art form and fashion shows are essentially like a gallery exhibition.   Kind of, but let's not lose sight of the fact that the point is to sell clothes. Even the  very abstract, inaccessible, and just not for sale looks have an economic point in that they drum up hype for the brand. The idea is that people will see those looks, decide they want to be a part of that aesthetic world, and go buy the more accessible ready to wear looks from the brand.	labels:No it really isn't, high fashion as we know it mostly exists within the fashion brand ecosystem in which it is funded through clothes sales but that's just because it's the most natural way for it to be funded. There are plenty of artists and designers that design pieces without having a ready to wear line, for the same reason an artist that draws furry porn for $500 a piece to pay the bills is not also painting landscapes in their spare time to hype up their porn business.	episode_done:True

Had a couple of pairs (several years old) lose the elasticity around the ankle of my no-shows, and I filed a claim on their website, sent the socks in, and they sent back a $17 online voucher for the site.

text:Why It's Important to have a Style POV & Desired Aesthetic	labels:[deleted]
text:Good questions!  1:  I think what most people assume is that they *have* to stick with the times and be "on trend".  I don't think that's true.  Obviously you will need to know your context (finance, creative, etc) and that will guide how experimental you get. I definitely think knowing what you want to look like early on is important. Basics can be done either through the basic bastard or heritage-americana/milsurp. Even a small POV like that will help guide the choices instead of just going through uniqlo.  Sticking to a POV will also help you stay consistent over the years, at least on a general "vibe" level. I think if you look at some of the prominent WAYWT users, while some pieces change, the vibe is largely the same. That's usually my goal and it takes the pressure off of trying to be "modern. It really just depends on what you're trying to accomplish with your clothing (which you should figure out early on!)   2:  Most of the time this happens, it's usually for someone early on in their journey.  In a stream on shoes, the guys and I talk about the concept of "forced versatility".  For the guys who live in inclement weather, they might like loafers, but danite soles derbies or paraboots make more sense. Because its an essential, its forced into their wardrobe. Either they play into it or it subverts the vibe. Since it's an intentional choice, I say it still works as their own POV.  So, if you like something, you should try it out! I do it quite a bit - I'm sure my POV results in a lot of micro-decisions that means if I'm intrigued by something, it probably can work. When you break out of wearing basics or being strictly to a style (like I was with period accurate clothing), it really opens things a lot. That's why I'm able to wear rugged military jackets with classic tailoring or wide legged pants in casual wear.   There are small connections I'm trying to make thanks to my POV and as a result, these "new things" that I like are novel, yet a natural extension.  It really just takes an open mind! The countless user albums here are proof that sometimes you can take a piece outside of its original aesthetic and wear it in a way that's personal.  I'd love if you have any personal anecdotes for this too! It really is a case-by-case basis and tbh, a POV (and learning to expand or play with it) can only really happen by communication with friends or a good style community (which i think MFA is)	labels:	episode_done:True

Another thing you could try are dark chukka boots as well.   The shoes aren't too casual, chinos, I guess depending on the colour can look pretty business casual - Why not throw on a sweater too?

My younger sibling usually rocks small heel, but my understanding is that a people wearing pumps are just changing into them at certain times.  I've (mostly) accepted imma be short and despite the fact I mainly wear dresses/skirts, I have no issues with length since I'm always shopping keeping my actual proportions, sans heels, in mind.  That said, apparently vintage reproduction or dance heels are great for every day since, done right, they have arch support and a more centered heel that redistributes your weight properly, and are made with the intention of Doing Stuff (though they're definitely a bit of an investment.)	episode_done:True
text:What are some habits that keep clothes/shoes new vs that habits that ruin them?	labels:I try to follow laundry labels as much as possible, especially with more expensive pieces.  That means going to the dry cleaner a lot for my work clothes. For bras, jeans and dresses that can be machine washed, I always hang dry. I avoid drying anything I am especially attached to on high heat.   As for purses, I always keep them in dustbags on a shelf, with paper stuffing to maintain their shape. Hanging them on a hook tends to weaken the straps.

text:Inspo Album - Statement Sweaters	labels:Lovely and inspiring album, OP. And I especially appreciate you listing prices. But that's also the problem, at least for me.   The statement all these statement sweaters seem to making is, "I pay more for sweaters than some people pay for cars."   The "goodwill chic" sweater is over a thousand dollars. Goodwill? Srsly?  Do people *really* pay this much for sweaters? How do they also pay their rent? Put kids through college? Save for retirement? I make over $200K a year, and I honestly don't get how you can even consider a purchase like this. Much as I love some of these styles.
text:I don‚Äôt think many people here actually buy $1K sweaters but I‚Äôll spend $100+ on a sweater.   It‚Äôs just meant to be inspo: here‚Äôs a cool sweater a designer made. Go find a similar one somewhere else.  As far as how people afford these or similarly expensive clothes: people have different lives and priorities. For instance, I live in a city with roommates. I don‚Äôt have kids. Or a car payment. And I just have different priorities. I‚Äôd rather buy a sweater than say an Apple Watch. Or a jacket than a car. Or new shoes instead of a gaming PC. Or pants versus going out to a restaurant.    So money is just allocated differently. It‚Äôs the same if you go to any hobbies sub and find someone spending outlandish money on bikes or cars or gym equipment or sneakers or sports tickets or going traveling or going to concerts or whatever.	labels:Yep.

Yellow was never my color, but this shade really works.  And I'm a Leo, so there you go.

[Homme Plisse pleated pants](https://i.imgur.com/36Y71Gb.jpg)  this was one half of a YAJ shipment and ended up being a big L for me and a big win for my girl.

[Vintage High Waisted Trousers](https://i.imgur.com/acYpAdO.jpg) Super pumped on this pair!

text:Brooks Brothers's Future Looks a Lot Like Menswear‚Äôs Past	labels:* Less SKUs. The amount of stuff BB sells is overwhelming.  * Do away with there weirdly named fit system. Change it to Extra Slim, Slim, Regular, Thicc Daddies * Revamp the BB website. It's been terrible for a long time. * Have the athleisure stuff, but also focus on high quality basics, again with less SKUs. Have something like an "essentials" line. The Navy Suit. The Charcoal Suit. The OCDB. The Chino. The Wool Trouser. Without fifty million variations thereof. You go now and it's like here are three navy suits with different kinds of stretch, here are four more with some kind of temperature controlling fabric. Just give me a half to full canvas lined 100% wool navy suit in various fits and sizes. In other words, simplify your menswear line to cut down on SKUs, and that will give you more room to play with sheep on skis and stuff (i think that does sound kind of cute, very Ralph Lauren). * Do away with Golden Fleece, Red Fleece. Mainline only. Again confusing to the consumer. * Where BB could play more is in areas like sport shirts. By all means offer your classics like blackwatch etc., but other menswear shops like Sid Mashburn or Todd Snyder offer all kinds of fun prints and colors while still feeling like classic #menswear.  i dunno, just riffing my own personal desires for BB. i don't know anything about running a large clothing manufacturer and retailer.

text:Your favourite men's style shopping "hacks"	labels:The most budget friendly thing you can do for clothing is to know how to take care of your clothes. You can pretty much find all you need to know about that [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/wiki/guides#wiki_clothing_care.2C_tailoring.2C_and_maintenance). A really simple rule to follow is to simply just use a gentle detergent, wash with cold water, use the gentle cycle, and to hang dry or dry flat. A dryer is really convenient but is really harsh on clothing. Even clothing from "low quality" brands should last a long time as long as you just take care of your clothes. A piece of clothing that is well taken care of will look better for longer, feel better for longer, and will last longer.  Another hack is to go to thrift stores in the fanciest area near wherever you live. They will often have the "nicest" clothing.  Buying used is also an option that people covered but a hack I used to use (I don't know if it's still relevant) is to buy used from Japan. It's a bit of a convoluted process to proxy it but it's a really great way to buy high quality denim and the get things from Japanese brands for a good price. [Here's a guide that looks go](https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/yahoo-auctions-english-guide/)od  Lastly, learn how to sew. If you want to have things fit *just* right, then getting it tailored is the way to go. Learning how to do simple tailoring like tapering pants or taking in a shirt will pay off in the long run, and you get to do a fun project and learn a useful life skill.
text:Japanese sources are probably also a good choice for traditional American suiting construction, particularly for skinnier guys who a lot of American brands would put in Euro cuts.    I'd also speculate that used clothing from there has some price advantage because Japan has more of a stigma against pre-owned items than other cultures due to animist customs lingering.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 22, 2020	labels:Levi's question - tried posting this last week and didn't get any answers so trying again :)  My old beloved 514's are getting too many holes, but in trying to find new ones on the Levi's website is......confusing. It seems everything is "stretch" now, and the pair of stretch I do have (511s) feel a little snug around the knees when sitting (which working from home all day in jeans means I'm sitting in jeans all day until the office opens again).  So, does Levi's even make 100% cotton jeans anymore? I'm hesitant to get the 514s with stretch since they are supposed to be a little baggy in the leg and I'm not sure how stretch would work, and I really don't love how "stretch" feels in general when it comes to jeans (but love stretch in my Everlane chinos that I used to wear when actually going to the office...some day again soon I hope!)  Finally, if all there is is stretch, would 513 be a better choice than 514 for what I am describing?
text:You want 100% cotton  if you want no-stretch. Here is a [100% cotton 514](https://www.levi.com/US/en_US/clothing/men/jeans/514-straight-fit-mens-jeans/p/005140308).  514 is a straight fit so consider the OG: Levi 501.

text:Does the way you dress really have to have a label for it??	labels:My closet has no cohesion and I have no aesthetic because most are meaningless anyway. Take the concept of French girl fashion because that used to be a big thing on here. There is no typical French girl style. I have three close Parisian friends. If you lined them up, not a one has the same style and not a single one would fit into the American romanticized version of what french women look like.   Do what you want. Wear what you like. Don't think so much about it.
text:Sorry that this is a bit off topic but this is a question that has been weighing on me for a while: do your Parisian friends get annoyed at all the Vogue-esque articles and media talking about ‚ÄúFrench girl beauty‚Äù or the ‚ÄúFrench girl look?‚Äù	labels:They think they are so silly / dated and a very romanticized version of what older women wear. Each of my friends are in their mid-20s. One used to work for Chanel and wears the craziest, coolest Street wear you've ever seen, like dad shoes, bucket hats, pearls on everything kinda awesome that only a few can pull off.

With the exception of socks, which I refuse to ever knit again. Those get holes in them so fast that I literally cried because I spent hundreds of hours making them and used fancy ass yarn. Store bought socks for me only.  ETA:  I took some quick pics of my sock situation: Top pic is a handknit sock that started to get a hole, you can see my finger through the stitches. The matching sock had a huge hole at the heel and has already been unravelled to use on something else. Second pic is a comparison between Smartwool on top and my handknit sock using Wollmeise on the bottom. My stitches look huge in comparison to the store bought ones üò¢ [https://imgur.com/a/WEHMRav](https://imgur.com/a/WEHMRav)
text:Me too. All my hand-knit sweaters are miles better than store bought sweaters. I think it comes down to the quality of the yarn and the fact that I use good techniques to keep the sweater from coming apart.     I went through a period when I was buying good quality second-hand sweaters and unraveling them for the yarn, but i quickly found that the yarn wasn't even twisted, just several individual fibers together. This leads to breakage, which leads to holes and pilling.     I also spend a ton of time on trial and error to get the right fit, making sure I'm happy with every detail.	labels:I just started knitting a couple of years ago and have yet to jump into a sweater project.

text:Are our ideas about what looks ‚Äúdated‚Äù on either ourselves or others affected by or correlated with our age?	labels:I‚Äôm over 40 and I think a lot of people my age do ‚Äòdate‚Äô themselves in the way they dress. I think a lot of it is to do with comfort level, and feeling they looked their best around 25-30 so getting stuck in a style rut where they feel most attractive in styles they wore a decade ago.
text:This makes sense. My boss is 50+ and she looks very dated to me because her style was my style when I was in middle school‚Äîlight wash, low rise flare jeans, tight Abercrombie-looking tee shirts, and her hair ‚Äústyle‚Äù is either straightened or half-up with the shorter front pieces pulled free.   She was probably around 30 when this was ‚Äúin‚Äù and seems stuck there.	labels: >her hair ‚Äústyle‚Äù is either straightened or half-up with the shorter front pieces pulled free.

Since I shop online exclusively, I keep checking every now & then, & swoop in when they have deals combined with free shipping. My latest finds are a Vince Camuto dress for $10, an Adrianna Papell occasion dress for $20, & a Tahari jacket for $10.	episode_done:True
text:What are your thoughts on outfit repeating multiple days in a row?	labels:I don‚Äôt typically repeat outfits multiple days in a row, unless I‚Äôm just putting on jeans and a T-shirt to run to the store or something.  But I do wear things many, many, many times before they go in the wash (like you, until it starts to smell).  I don‚Äôt think I would care if someone else wore the same outfit all week at all. I honestly would love to do that.  Especially in the winter, I‚Äôd love to, if I didn‚Äôt have one coworker who points out something about my outfit every day.  I know she means well, but it bothers me, because while I try to dress nicely, I‚Äôm not trying to make a statement, because I like to repeat things on more of a weekly basis.  She‚Äôll make comments like ‚Äúyou wear that shirt a lot,‚Äù but hey, I like this shirt.  I also don‚Äôt have a washer/dryer so laundry isn‚Äôt convenient for me, and not washing so much helps the clothes look good longer.  Out of laziness, I hang all of my clothes.  When I take them off I usually I leave them out of the closet overnight, and I think it helps to air them out so they stay fresh and don‚Äôt smell so fast.
text:Ugh your coworker sounds very annoying. I wonder if this comes from the mindset of trying to always give a compliment with something not body related? Like "nice sweater" instead of "nice hair", but... gone wrong?	labels:Yes! I kind of think that‚Äôs what it is. Mostly, I think she‚Äôs trying to be nice and show that she‚Äôs paying attention and cares, but sometimes I just want her to not notice haha.   It kills me inside when I feel like I‚Äôm having a sloppy day and she has to be like ‚ÄúI love your necklace.‚Äù	episode_done:True

text:How do you style your existing wardrobe in a way that doesn‚Äôt get boring?	labels:Two things helped me break out of a rut: first, take photos of all your outfits in the morning (and try to make outfits with most of your clothes). After a few weeks, look back over your photos and see what you like - silhouettes, colors, pieces and looks that excite you - and then try to figure out what they have in common. Also, see what you DON‚Äôt like - fits poorly or feels blah. I find it can be easier to do this when looking at a photo than when looking in the mirror. Second, try switching up your color pairings! Pull out some pieces you own in various colors, lay them out on your bed, and see what color combos you find pleasing (even if it‚Äôs two sweaters). Make note of what you like and see if you can branch out a bit :)	episode_done:True
text:What‚Äôs on everyone‚Äôs Black Friday wishlists?	labels:I bought a pair of boots from [Steve madden](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0046/5548/0950/products/STEVEMADDEN-BOOTIES_JOELLA_BLACK-LEATHER_grande.jpg?v=1573904911) not a winter boot by any means, but I really wanted a lower cut daily boot, and this really fit the bill.       Really wanted a brown coat, I have a navy blue peacoat that is super fuzzy alpaca, and I saw the aritzia [Steadman](https://aritzia.scene7.com/is/image/Aritzia/large/f20_01_a05_79351_19069_off_a.jpg) in the camel hair, in the darker brown colour, and it was perfect. I really wanted the slouch, but I'm 5ft so I just looked like I was swimming in it.           I also bought a [Winnie the Pooh](https://imgur.com/a/OqeoU2f) plushie from the Disney store for myself. This so far has been my favorite purchase.          Oh and I had a coach gift card I finally used.
text:Same! I'm also 5 ft tall and tried on the Steadman coat -- it was SO bad but the pictures on models are SO beautiful. I was actually pretty disappointed because I had my mind set on it to be my new winter coat.	labels:Honestly the coat is so nice, I really liked the brushed camel, and how big the collar was and all. But even shortening the coat would look weird. The shorter Steadman is very similar looking, just the details are I guess smaller looking? I purchased it in a size small, fits looser on me so I can wear it over suit blazers n all.	episode_done:True

I struggle to reconcile colors that I love like burnt orange, burgundy, brown, cream, and tan with a springier vibe.   2. Wear historical clothing most days. I started off with a wardrobe project in early pandemic days and thought it was so fun that I started keeping up with it. I still occasionally wear ‚Äúregular‚Äù clothes but much less than before. I‚Äôd love to keep this going.   3. Get organized??? No real idea how to do this with so many weird/big things around.   4. Buy no more than 5 pieces, but I can sew as many new things as I like. Underwear and things I can‚Äôt feasibly make, like shoes, don‚Äôt count towards my five item total. I‚Äôve just made so many unsatisfying purchases that turned out to be a bit of a waste.

text:What inspired your passion/love for fashion?	labels:I love my mom a lot. I'm in my 30s now and she and I are really close, we talk most days.  I grew up in an upper middle-class family in an upper middle-class+ area, while my parents (both first-generation immigrants) grew up with a lot less. They were frugal with their money in some odd ways and one of those ways was with clothing. They're still frugal in that way...for example they were very generous and contributed quite a bit of money to my wedding yet my mom wore a $20 clearance dress from Kohl's (didn't bother me) in a color that outright clashed with our wedding colors (that bothered me but I digress).  This sounds shallow, and it is, but growing up all my friends wore Hollister/Abercrombie/etc. every day, while my mom absolutely refused to pay those prices and would buy my sister and me clothes from Kohl's, JCPenney, and similar stores. I begged and begged for brand name clothes and she wouldn't relent so I started baby-sitting and also reffing soccer and umping softball games starting at the age of 12, riding my bike to get to my various jobs. I literally spent 75% of my paychecks on clothes and saved the rest. As soon as I turned 16 I also got a job at the mall which was THE coolest place to work...I think I started at PacSun.  That love of buying brand name clothes because they were cool grew over time into a love of buying clothes that actually flatter me and I enjoy wearing. And despite my best efforts my mom still happily wears her objectively hideous $17 sweaters, and she still thinks I'm crazy for not wearing those sweaters. To each their own :)
text:I definitely relate to being the child of first gen immigrants who bought me clothes from Kohls and JC Penney when all I wanted was brand names ‚Äì Justice and Limited Too as a child, and Hollister, A&F, PINK, and Juicy as a teenager. I absolutely think my extreme interest in brand names stems from that!

Flip flops immediately slide forward, and your foot slides through the side. Now, not only is your foot not protected, but there is a loose piece of clothing hindering your movement! Hiking, riding a bike, any sports activity, any activity in an urban area, all require shoes. Fine, if you live on a beach, wear flip flops; but other than walking into a public bathroom prior to or after taking a shower, ditch the flip flops.	labels:I live in a suburb dude I don‚Äôt think I need to worry about ‚Äúit‚Äù too much	episode_done:True

I do wear a 1-inch heeled ankle boot pretty regularly, but I barely count that as a heel.

That‚Äôs when I tend to get uncomfortable with what I wear and have a mini identity crisis. Some weeks I like bold retro look, other weeks I borrow from dark academia, this week I‚Äôm weirdly into hiking wear and dad hats with funny quotes on them. I make it all work though in some weird way. I just stopped trying to find a way to describe it and just go with the flow of whatever I was drawn to.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 05, 2021	labels:For some reason, I have the stereotype that American and British dress shoes are boxier/bulkier looking than their European counterparts from Italy and Spain. Is this true?  Separately, how do you dress up a boxy pair of dress shoes? What should be the fit of the suit like?
text:I'd say it's basically true and is a combination of last shape and construction. Continental lasts tend to be very long and narrow, and even have semi-square "chisel toe" along with higher insteps. American lasts especially tend to have rounder toes, which creates a pretty strong impression of a boxy look. You also see differences in construction: goodyear welted continental shoes often have a narrower welt with the stitching much tighter to the vamp, but you also see blake stitching way more in continental shoes (especially Italian, I feel), and a blake stitch is just way more streamlined looking than a goodyear welt	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- October 23	labels:Hey folks, I'm looking for boot recommendations and my needs are a bit specific. If anyone happens to have any recs that fit these criteria I'd love to hear it! Thanks.   1) Have to be able to survive Toronto winter; good traction and durability are a must.   2) I have to be able to wear them in an office setting. My office is business casual but exceptions are made for winter boots, people wear all kinds of behemoths in there in the winter. Still, I want it to actually look decent with a dress shirt and chinos.  3) Something that would also look decent with more streetwear/techwear style outfits. That's generally my style when I'm not at work, so I'd like it to be nice looking with a hoodie and some cargo pants too.   4) Budget is probably $300 CAD, but I can save up and stretch a bit for the right item, rather do that than half ass it.   I know that's a lot, so thanks for anyone who's bothered reading it and especially if you respond. Cheers!

text:FAQ: How do I know my clothes weren't made with slave labour?	labels:While not a direct answer to the question, I'll suggest that for those who are concerned about slave labor in the apparel industry and want to know what they can do to help... reduce, reuse, recycle.   You can reduce demand for new clothing by cutting back on clothing purchases where possible. If something doesn't fit quite right or is damaged, consider taking it to a tailor or mending yourself rather than immediately rushing out to buy a replacement.  When you want or need to buy something, consider buying used clothes instead of new where possible (easier than ever even if you don't have local thrift shops thanks to the rise of the secondhand menswear market on ebay, Grailed, TheRealReal, etc.).  Not that any of the above is a substitute for systemic change, but at least it can help you avoid becoming part of the problem.	episode_done:True

But I just love crazy fashion, and it makes me so happy everyday. But there's still some of my things where I feel a little hesitant on wearing them sometimes because I know they're REALLY over the top, like my jacket today got stared down by pretty much everyone I walked by, and that was kinda strange.

text:Stockings vs Tights vs Leggings	labels:What kind of shoes are you going to be wearing?  When I lived in Massachusetts I would wear tights or silk long johns and layer them under over-the-knee socks with boots.  The worst part of skirts or dresses when it's really bad out is how cold your knees and lower thighs get.  Generally a good coat will cover you butt and upper thigh.

text:People who've been working from home for most of 2020 - do you think your work style will change when you go back to the office (compared to your work wardrobe pre-lockdown)? If so, how?	labels:I am a teacher that went back to working in the building at the beginning of September, so to be fair I was only wfh for several months in the spring, but it still drastically changed my style, or my perspective on my style.   Pre-Covid my work style (and general style) had morphed over the years to become very, very minimal and neutral. Lots of Everlane and Eileen Fisher. This was both because I wanted to be taken seriously at my job (I read very young) and because it also seemed like what was in style to me.   Returning to work in the fall, I realized I really f*cking hated all of my sensible, plain, go with everything black and grey clothes.   I still really prefer earth tones and blacks and greys, and I still wear some pretty simple outfits somedays, but I went on a small spree on The RealReal after I had my realization. I bought myself some louder statement pieces that feel more me, including an embroidered Happy Sheep sweater, a knit Missoni sheath dress, a multi-colored leather and fur purse, platform oxfords, and a couple of geometric patterned silk shirts and dresses.   For me life is too short to try so hard to be timeless and professional. I‚Äôm not knocking the look, it just isn‚Äôt ~me~ I want to love the clothes I wear and the clothes I love are fun knits and patterns.
text:I also work at a school and realized I hated all of my pre-Covid, neutral clothes! Like to the point that I couldn‚Äôt wear them without getting very depressed.

Unbelievably comfortable.   [Topo Designs](topodesigns.com) I don't see this one recommended very often because it's a really specific aesthetic but it really fits my lifestyle. I'm a rock climber/trail runner and I really love their technical streetwear vibe with bold punch colors and color blocks.

Expensive (accounts for more than half my total clothing expenditure for the year), but it's totally my style, comfy, warm, huge pockets, fills a gap in my closet.  Worst: Rothy's. I gave into the hype and got myself a pair. Not good for walking in, and even at the end of a day sitting at my desk wearing them, my feet stink. Should have known better. They are cute, but that's about it. (I'll shout out to Allbirds here - got the runners and they're great. I mean, they're chunky sneakers so they're for casual/athletic use, but they do their job great.)  My only other clothing regret this year is that I lost one of my favorite bras somewhere in Utah or Nevada before lockdown started :(
text:It really bugs me when shoe sizing is all over the place, which is true for both Tieks and Rothy's; For Rothy's points I need a 10, flats 9.5, 10.5 in the loafer - it's just soooo annoying since even within the same style you can need different sizes (looking at you Tieks!). Like, cmon people - you're not LuLaRoe! And the stench! I don't have problems with any of my other shoes smelling, so what is the deal with these two brands?	labels:I went on a Tieks binge that I deeply regret like two years ago. I sold the black ones on Poshmark. I lost the cobalt blue pair somewhere in Florence but I didn't even care. I still have one pair of like a neutral tan color, but... I don't know when I'll ever wear them again. They do not live up to the hype.	episode_done:True

text:For those who actually MISS clothes/makeup/getting dressed up.	labels:I really love clothing, but because of quarantine and being a new mom with a new mom bod I have not got the time or resources to work on my fashion/style. That being said I do really want a new mom wardrobe, like I want bright colorful clothing that screams fun when I‚Äôm hanging out with my child. I figure I have about a year to get my ish together . So I‚Äôm going to start a fun mom clothing savings, and then go buy fun clothes. I‚Äôm thinking overalls, bright pink sweater that says mom, yellow and purple jeans. Jeans with polka dots! It might sound childish but that‚Äôs the point I want to meet my child in his childhood, I want him to have a fun parent.   Does this seem odd?
text:Your mom wardrobe sounds awesome!! Look up the tv show Catastrophe - this sounds a lot like Sharon‚Äôs wardrobe. I loved her clothes and want to emulate her style.	labels:I have seen that  show and I believe she was a grade school teacher as well. I‚Äôll add her to my inspirational looks, I remember her having wildly awesome pants! Thank you!	episode_done:True
text:What did your mom teach you about fashion/style - and what did she not teach you?	labels:My mom taught me that tank tops were for whores and if I wore them it was only to make boys look at my chest (not because it was hot out?), that shorts showed off the "cellulite" on my 16-year-old thighs (oh hello lifetime of body image issues!), and that any form-fitting shirt was an open invitation to "those boys that were only after one thing" (referring to my male friends, many of whom I am still friends with, and married to one of them, 25 years later and are all the most anti-misogynistic people I know). She also questioned the size of any piece of clothing I tried on (really, JBT-Lover, a size MEDIUM??? Are you sure you don't need a large? I'm 5'7" and 125 lbs btw, but it's always nice to hear that you definitely look a whole size larger than you are during every shopping outing.)   She did not teach me that clothing was an expression of who YOU are, not of the people who might be looking at you. Moms... *eyeroll*
text:I'm sorry but reading that my first thought was "really, a size MEDIUM? Are you sure you're not a small?"  In all seriousness I'm 5' 7" and ~135 and always thought I was a size larger than I really am up until a few years ago. Being a teenage girl is strange and body image is all over the place. I'm so much happier now that I realize that the size isn't the most important thing (i mean I can fit in both a size 4 and a size 8 pair of jeans from different brands so the numbers are fairly *general*)	labels:Ha if I had a smaller chest I probably woulda been a size small, but my boobs always filled or overfilled clothing so I usually had to size up. At this point in my life, I'm just glad to be a pretty standard size where if I order something online in an 8, it's more than likely going to fit me unless the brand is way off on its size scale. I have been a little skinnier and a little fatter, which sucks because then I was borderline sizes and I never knew if it was gonna fit or not.	episode_done:True
text:What are your go-to, everyday shoes?	labels:Doc Marten boots. You'll get compliments from gen-x'ers because they used to be cool in the 90's, and you'll get compliments from millennials and Gen Z'ers because they're cool again. They're kinda like the band The Pixies. If you know, you know. They're also terribly comfortable and waterproof.  You'll buy 'em and wear them for years.   People will talk about how they're different now and not as good as before but even this new version are still high quality to me. I wear [this pair](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pinterest.com%2Fpin%2F654570127070834072%2F&psig=AOvVaw2G4DCAafxUzdLn3d3X6JTS&ust=1609867019606000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAIQjRxqFwoTCJi9z5Dkgu4CFQAAAAAdAAAAABAM) with everything.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - February 16, 2021	labels:I‚Äôm lusting over these [RGT](https://www.rogueterritory.com/collections/tops/products/bm-shirt-olive-buffalo-plaid?variant=33097644376169) and [3Sixteen](https://www.3sixteen.com/blogs/news/drunk-check-crosscut-flannels) flannels in a Buffalo plaid-ish pattern. They both look amazing, but for $250+ I could probably buy 3-5 decent flannels in similar color prints, since Buffalo check flannels are pretty ubiquitous now.  I‚Äôve always been someone willing to fork over a ton of money for jeans and GYW shoes. If you take care of them, they should last 5 years to a lifetime. But with shirts, it‚Äôs more difficult.  Shirts can stain, rip, shrink unexpectedly, and are easier to imitate exclusive patterns.   I know MIUSA or Made in Japan are important when it comes to ethical labor. I know the fabrics are heavier and may last longer than a cheaper alternative. The fit might be better too. But I‚Äôm just not sure all of that adds up for a sub-$300 flannel.   Can anyone who regularly buys these brands argue the other side of why one SHOULD drop this kind of money on a high quality flannel? I‚Äôd love to buy one of the pieces. It‚Äôs just a lot of money to drop and I‚Äôd like to hear someone else‚Äôs thoughts.

But I think it looks adorable and I love it, even as someone who worries about looking juvenile because of my size.	episode_done:True
text:How to avoid looking older with your clothing??	labels:Just dropping in to say that I find it funny that a 14 year old is afraid of looking older than their actual age. When I was 14, all I wanted to do was to look like a college freshman. People look down their noses at teenagers, (especially teenage girls) and so I tried to fake maturity and experience, because I thought it would be beneficial to me. But then again! I only enjoyed my early twenties for a few blissful years, after which I discovered that I should apparently be grateful for stuff like getting carded (ohmygawd you guys, I'm so happy this stranger thinks I look too young to be legally drinking!!). So I actually get that someone would panic at 14 years of age, if they were aware of the small window of time in which women are allowed to feel satisfied with their looks.   However, there's no way someone is going to mistake you for being in your 20's just because you're dressing "old". You could dress like a truly old woman complete with all the muted/pastel colors, curly short hair, and kitten heels you desire - people would just think you have alternative style.   The reason some people worry about dressing old, is because once you hit your mid-20's, people start aging at much different rates than they did before. So, 35 year old woman could be mistaken as someone in their early 40's who just looks good for their age, because of styling alone. But you are way too young to be worrying about this.   And dark academia isn't even an old-ish style - it reads as slightly naive (mostly in a good way) to most people who actually went to university. In fact this look has more to do with private schools than uni.	episode_done:True

And I don‚Äôt care about what you say you are. Fedoras/Dusters/Capes/whatever is not just clothing. It‚Äôs an entire lifestyle and subculture that you are unlikely to be privy to or even fit into if you lack the euphoria and pedigree. That‚Äôs just the reality.  You‚Äôre probably one of those people who believes anybody can be anything yada yada yada. Sorry to break it to you, but no matter how much I want to be, say, a gentlesir, it simply isn‚Äôt going to happen. I can don the wolf shirts all I want, but it doesn‚Äôt change the fact that because it isn‚Äôt who I was born, it‚Äôs something I‚Äôll never be. The same goes for most of the people on this subreddit who, by most accounts, even detest and reject the trappings of class that can not be divorced from euphoria. It is a style of, by, and for the American lower basement class and below, and nothing you say will change that.   It‚Äôs literally a costume for most of the people on this sub, and frankly, it‚Äôs subversive and I despise it.

text:What did your mom teach you about fashion/style - and what did she not teach you?	labels:My mom had the coolest, eclectic style. I grew up in a stepford wives type suburb where most of my peers were all Abercrombie/Hollister models with the latest Steve Madden shoes and coach bags (2000s). My mom owned a thrift shop and was gifted in finding hidden gems. Sometimes I felt like her doll because she‚Äôd find funky outfits to dress me in. Stuff I was way too insecure or embarrassed to wear but her confidence in me was enough to make me feel invincible as a teen.   My mom could‚Äôve been a trend forecaster. She was always way ahead of trends and exuded confidence in her fashion over all else. So in terms of style my mom taught me how to mix different styles, layer, make funky stuff work, and basically just wear things that make you feel confident and unique.  I lost my mom 5 years ago but still feel very connected to her through fashion and wish she could see me today with my own closet. I think she‚Äôd want to trade items with me and I think of her when I find cool/different things. For me fashion is about feeling like your best self and dressing to take on the world. It helped me overcome my insecurities and feel comfortable in my own skin. Plus it is a tangible way to feel connected to my mom in an intimate and personal way!	episode_done:True

I used the HELL out of that bag and still have it somewhere in my closet.

text:How do you style your existing wardrobe in a way that doesn‚Äôt get boring?	labels:I also have a large collection of clothes that stumps me, and here's what I'm doing that's helping:  1. I made a list of every TV character I could think of whose style I like   2. Research: I made folders of inspo photos for each one/re watched some episodes/read "how to dress like" articles   3. Started putting together outfits I thought they would wear, instead of thinking "what do I want to wear today?"  A sample of characters I referenced: Darlene from Roseanne, Shane from the L Word, Aria Montgomery from Pretty Little Liars, Jenny Humphrey from Gossip Girl (Season 2)  ETA Thank you for the awards kind strangers! This project just keeps getting more fun! Also fixed some formatting.  2nd ETA For the research part, I found that it was important to actually go back and rewatch the character in action, not just rely on other people's lists/Pinterest. I would have done Pretty Little Liars soooo differently if I hadn't rewatched some of my favorite episodes, because the lists tend to feature their most ambitious/ridiculous looks.

text:What are your go-to, everyday shoes?	labels:I wear Altra running shoes. I‚Äôm not a runner, and they‚Äôre not the cutest, but they‚Äôre certainly the most comfortable shoes I‚Äôve ever worn. The specific kind I have are the Escalante 2 road running sneakers. I have the heather black color. The colors they have now are way better than what they used to be! I used to wear grey and lime green ones! XD The newer styles can better serve as regular, everyday shoes.  If you‚Äôre looking for heels, I have a really comfy pair that are actually dance shoes! I bought them while I still took two ballet lessons a week, and they have served me well for about three years now. They‚Äôre just plain black heels that were built for dancing, so they have really nice support. I‚Äôm not sure what brand I have, they might be Capezio, but if you go on any online dance store you should be able to find some. Our ballet class always called them character shoes; I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs what they‚Äôre actually called or not.	episode_done:True
text:People who've been working from home for most of 2020 - do you think your work style will change when you go back to the office (compared to your work wardrobe pre-lockdown)? If so, how?	labels:My clothing style used to be relatively minimalist -- I lived for almost two years out of just a suitcase and a carry-on, and had two or three uniforms that I wore nearly every day. In classic "Millennial circa 2016" fashion, I was a huge fan of *experiences over things*.  Now that there are essentially no experiences to be had, fuck it: I want things! It makes me feel some semblance of normalcy to put on a "real" outfit, do my makeup, style my hair (even if I sometimes get teased by my coworkers for it). And I enjoy the ritual of shopping, too, whether in-person or online. Thrifting is one of the few in-person activities available to me right now, and it's especially fun to get packages during this time.   That said, I definitely have moved toward more casual, easy-to-put-on shoes. I'm not wearing shoes around the house, and I'm not eager to deal with high heels or complicated strappy shoes just to get a coffee. I'm also not wearing as many skirts and dresses as I normally do in winter, because I'm not going to wear tights without shoes.

I'll also continue logging outfits daily with Stylebook, because it helps me be honest with myself about what is and isn't getting worn in my closet (both for getting-rid-of purposes AND for informing-future-purchases purposes), *and* it'll help me focus in on what I gravitate toward in my day-to-day life rather than continually shopping for some nebulously just-out-of-reach fantasy self.   Summed up:  * Buy less, buy secondhand, buy practical, buy for TODAY (not a dream and a half from now), and buy only what is genuinely needed (very likely *nothing* for quite a while).  * Continue evaluating what I really need in my life, and how much, and adjust accordingly as time goes on with the goal of seriously paring down my closet to a manageable size.
text:Also, be conscious about the "need" aspect. People tend to say that they need a new sweater, when they really mean they want a new sweater in a different color to match better with some stuff in their wardrobe.  I stopped years ago with those kinds of purchases, because I realized the "shop sustainable" is just talk from people that want to keep buying while not feeling as wasteful.  I haven't bought any clothes for years. No shoes. I have huge style holes in my "fashion matching wardrobe", but I solve that by just not wearing certain items together.  The truth is, it's a bit boring, from a fashion standpoint. I sit there show creaming my old boots and fixing a hole in my bag. But then again, if you already have a sweater, you don't need another one. If you already have a pair of summer shoes, you don't need another pair, no matter how bad they match with some things in your wardrobe.  If one always keeps this in mind, it will feel stupid to replace a super basic pair of pants that are beyond repair with a pair of pants that don't fill the most functions possible. Aka, no sequin pants that can only be worn with heels and a tube top.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:How do you wear square scarves?	labels:How fabulous! I've been wearing a square silk scarf almost every day for the last 5 years or so. I love them. They are so versatile.   There are so many guides out there on how to tie scarves. One of my favorites is on [the Purse Forum](https://forum.purseblog.com/threads/the-how-to-guide-for-scarves-no-chatter.189943/). Hermes publishes lots of guides and [a free app](http://silkknots.hermes.com/) on tying scarves as well.   There are ways to tie the scarf around the neck without having the scarf feel right around the neck, including in a necklace style. [In this example,](http://www.maitaispicturebook.com/2011/09/collier-knot-with-90-carres.html?m=0) you can tie the scarf onto your tank top!   [Head bands or wraps](https://youtu.be/WPS3iTjBbPo) are very chic and warm in the winter.   You could also wear scarves as [halter tops](https://knotjustascarf.tumblr.com/post/52370788725/waytotie70) or bandeaus or other clothing, depending on the size of the scarf.   A silk scarf can be a really pretty way to wear a clutch as a shoulder bag or [dress up a purse](https://sandandscarf.com/blogs/sand-and-scarf/best-ways-to-dress-up-your-handbag-with-a-scarf).   To aid in styling your looks, you can use hair ties, scarf rings, or small magnets to secure and style the scarf. I don't recommend using pins because those holes can leave permanent marks in the fabric.   But just play! These are meant to be individualized looks! Getting the look perfect is not the point. The beauty of silk is that it flows and rumples so that it looks easy and elegant simultaneously.  EDIT: I also really like to use little scarves as pocket squares in coats and blazers. And some people wear them like bracelets, but that's not a look that functionally works for me.

text:Has anyone else ever tried on a designer item just to see what the hype is about?	labels:Coming from a culture where bespoke clothing is abundant, designer brands are only just gaining popularity and a country where clothing is manufactured, I think my perspective on designer clothing is very different. Growing up with a textile engineer parent and having been surrounded by intricately hand crafted clothing, designer clothing - even the higher end ones - still feel sub-par in terms of quality. Sure, it is certainly better made, can last longer and likely fits great off the rack than obviously cheap clothing. But to me, it doesn't hold the same meaning as spending on unique, locally handcrafted pieces which can be expensive but still a fraction of what designer brands can cost. Personal ethics and feelings aside, I also find the clothing materials are not always high-quality just because they feel good (taught by my parent to tell not just from the feel but also weave, the specific material or blend used, etc).  Designer brands do win out for me when they are innovative. And while I am a fan of avant-garde designers and fashion houses, I view it more as wearable art and therefore not something you would wear often.  But none of these reasons make them any less fun to try on!
text:Do you mind me asking what country?  As much as I recognize the convenience (however angry I get about all of the negatives it also brings) of brands and off the rack clothing, I‚Äôve always wanted to see this sort of bespoke and textile manufacturing world in person, especially as it seems it is dying out in most part of the world.  Maybe I can visit sometime a few years from now, when corona has receded and I have some decent spending money :D	labels:Sure! I'm from India but I imagine a lot of South Asian and other Asian countries are very similar in that aspect. Handicraft and small scale clothing production is definitely diminishing because it is so time and labour intensive but the consumer is not as willing to pay for it. But the government and other organizations are putting in some effort to promote and raise awareness around it. If you do get a chance to purchase bespoke or handicrafts, I am sure you would make some small business owners very happy, especially in a post-covid world.	episode_done:True
text:Changing Your Habits: Deciding to Not Shop Brands for Ethical or Other Reasons & Following Through	labels:One thing I do is remind myself that whatever I want isn't usually one of a kind. This helps me with makeup buying, because I fall in love with colours and buy them and my lipstick collection is out of control. I have to keep reminding myself that whatever beautiful colour I just found out about is either a dupe of something I probably have OR if that colour isn't something I own but the brand is garbage, that other brands will definitely have that colour too.  So for fashion, if you fall in love with a bag from a brand you can't support, just remember that no bag is unique (unless it's like an awesome bag that looks like a giraffe or something). If you love Chanel flaps but refuse to buy from them, there are so many other versions. I have one by Rebecca Minkoff but luxury brands make chain flap purses too without the ickiness of supporting Coco Chanel.  I'm a knitter and weaver, so most knit and woven things I can make myself if I don't like the brand. Same with yarn, if there's a yarn company I don't support, there are millions of other yarn brands out there where I can find something similar enough.  In general, no matter what you're trying to buy, there will be other brands that make something like it. So if you must have it, you don't have to buy from the brand you hate.	episode_done:True

text:Have you ever gone out on a limb and bought clothing from an unknown brand advertised on Instagram/Facebook/online? How did it work out?	labels:I ordered from [Manier De Voir](http://manieredevoir.com/) in late 2020 after having seen them in a Facebook ad. I had them on my radar for a few months after seeing the ad, but between the UK sizing, the expensive returns, and my overall unfamiliarity with the brand, I waited until the Black Friday sale to pull the trigger on anything. Overall I was happy with my purchases--the quality was good, especially for the sale price, and I did not need to return anything, although I did run into a sizing issue with one item due to some US/UK sizing differences. Their aesthetic is well within my comfort zone--I really liked the lowkey-cyberpunk/techwear take on loungewear and athletic wear that they had-- but it didn't expand any horizons for me; I won't be visiting their site if I want fresh inspiration or to check up regularly on new items. But all in all the algorithm did its job well--I saw, I liked, I remembered, I bought.   A LOT of these "instagram brands" though are just dropshippers; you'd often be able to find identical stock photos to many items through AliExpress, Taobao, Shein, Wish, YesStyle, etc. and I strongly recommend running reverse image searches on stock photos to see if you can find them elsewhere. This is *especially* true for those ads for businesses on Facebook that claim to be "going out of business"--the vast majority of those stock photos are actually stolen from other shops/designers and don't look like what you'll receive. Manier De Voir in particular seemed like a legitimate company with their own in-house stock, distinct aesthetic, and consistent use of the same models and staging, all of which negated most concerns about dropshipping.

The five stripes are embroidered rather than sewn on. They're just shaped/cut in a different/cooler way.     Also: there are different cuts of these pants, some are flared like cowboy jeans, some are ultra wide. They come in unique fabrics, like velour or shiny metallic poly or faux-snakeskin or leather.	labels:Fun fact, adidas beckenbauers are pleated in the front too!	episode_done:True

text:How many clothes do you have? (Really?)	labels:I'm actually working on a spreadsheet inventory of my wardrobe this weekend! I have everything done but my very small closet, but I can guess what's in there. I don't consider myself a minimalist, but clothes also aren't a hobby for me. I'm somewhat utilitarian and I like to have 1-2 pieces that meet each occasion. My inventory has things broken out by tops, bottoms, dresses, shoes, outerwear, and intimates and by style (casual, dressy casual, construction/yardwork, lounge, formal).   So far my count is: 9 jeans, 5 leggings, 10 shorts, 2 dressy pants, 25 t-shirts, 3 clubbing tops, 2 leotards, 10 sweaters, some layering cami's/tank tops, 15 shoes, 5 jackets/coats,  7 pajamas/sweatpants, 4 bras + 5 bralettes.  I'm about to get a breast reduction so I'll be buying some new clothes that fit better soon. I'm getting rid of a lot of t-shirts that are falling apart, pants with holes in the crotches or are stretched to oblivion. Part of the purpose of doing this inventory is I want to be mindful about replacing any clothes. I want anything I purchase to fill a niche in my wardrobe or be something that I REALLY want. I want to stop buying clothing that I think looks just ok or "would fit me if..." or isn't comfortable.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 15, 2020	labels:Moore's or Indochino?  I've got a wedding coming up in the new year, I'm using it as an excuse to get a suit tailored from scratch. I've been wearing ill-fitting Value Village suits for the past decade and want something I can use for job interviews and black tie events. Both Moore's and Indochino offered to make me a suit for $550 CAD. I have no independent Tailor shops that actually sell clothing in my city, they just adjust clothing you bring, that's why I'm not going to them.  I was just rewatching the first season of Better Call Saul which, at least the first few episodes made me realize how a cheap suit, fitted or not, can really look bad.
text:If that price can get you a made to measure at Moores, I'd go to Moores over Indochino. They have actual tailors on site and any alterations are done in person whereas from what I know Indochino only employs sales people in their stores who can't measure worth a damn and all garment work it's done by some random person in China. Shop around the different locations at Moores though as some have terrible and pushy reps.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:How does your makeup style and clothing style relate? - discussion	labels:Im Op I‚Äôll share mine-  Personally I sort of plan my makeup look based of what I‚Äôm wearing   I do mostly dramatic Smokey eyes and cut crease looks with bright blush and lipstick everywhere in colors that either match my outfit or just compliment it well! I also do more eye liner dramatic looks at times as well! Usually if I‚Äôm wearing something a bit more cutesy I‚Äôll do my makeup to reflect the look. If Im wearing my black velvet blazer set I‚Äôll do th√© likes of and orange and gold Smokey eye to make it more bold and less professional looking! I have a very dressy style with masculine, Victorian, and highly detailed elements so bold colorful makeup makes some of my more stuffy looks less boring. I‚Äôve lately been after doing my foundation putting a bit of blush from the bottom front of my eye bags to the top of my brow bone. I love how it makes makeup a little more unique and makes me look a little less baby faced.  I used to wear very skater boyish/ art kid outfits and hair ( I still respect the style still though ) but wore heavy Instagram glam style makeup. I still do glam makeup but it looked quite odd at times! I didn‚Äôt really think much about makeup in relation to clothing then, not that it‚Äôs really necessary! I feel I‚Äôve come far with my style!

text:Shitpost Saturday: Advice on Learning How to Hate Fashion	labels:The main reason I started hating fashion was the whole high school culture I was in. A lot of people sneered at girly girls and considered them un-cool and dumb. I was the one winning essay competitions, topping classes, etc. and was afraid I would never be taken seriously if I wore girly fashion. Our family's economic situation didn't help either. Mom and I would shop for clothes once a year when there were heavy discounts. And the discounted clothes weren't really ever good for matching stuff. I wore random clothes all the time. Now that I have started earning, I can't stop buying cool clothes that I like. I look at outfit inspo and decide if it works for my body, I'll buy that entire outfit. The sad part is, I started buying stuff at the beginning of this year and because of COVID, haven't been able to wear them at all. I also hate the entire I'm looking down my nose at you attitude that a lot of people who were fashionable had. It's a milliom times better in these days of online shopping and accessible YouTube videos!	episode_done:True

text:The Terribly High Cost of Cheap Goods	labels:Don't believe companies when they say something domestically produced will cost tons more. They lie! It's pure green. Unfettered capitalism. Maximum profit, minimal expense. I've discovered many high quality brands that have their goods made ethically and away from China! They do not cost a lot more and I'm happy to support locally made. No I'm not rich. The problem is that big greedy companies have the marketing budget to promote their cheaply made crap and thus make it hard for smaller independent brands to compete. But we have reddit which has been super useful in discovering such independent brands.
text:One company that changed my mind a bit about ethics in china is Grant Stone, I believe they are transparent and ethical with the labor involved in producing theirs boots.

text:What age did you start pinning down your style? And how many times has it changed since then?	labels:I work in an office and am supposed to dress business casual.   My entire closet is work clothes and while some of it is cute it‚Äôs mostly boring and safe.   I feel like my personal style is edgy and fun. I‚Äôm working on curating a weekend wardrobe and not focusing on work outfits until I have just as much weekend  and after work clothes. I‚Äôm thinking fun  Art teacher and also colorful mom clothes but we will see I also like basics a lot like jeans and a black top .
text:I love the idea of a weekend wardrobe! I work in an office where everybody is super casual (jeans and T-shirts) that whenever I dress up (wear a cute dress or even mini skirt + stockings in the winter), I get asked if I have plans after work or I end up feeling overdressed. So even if I do feel good when I leave the house, I feel super conscious by the time I get to the office. A weekend wardrobe sounds like a good plan!	labels:I was in the exact same situation as you a couple years ago! When I first started wearing cute clothes to work I def felt self conscious. I'm sure I got a lot of "why the heck is she so dressed up" stares. But I kept dressing cute and eventually people were like oh that's just how she dresses - i.e. you just gotta own it. (I did start slow though, so like I worked my way up from casual to minor upgrades to clothes to more cutesy looks)  Disclaimer: everybody's situation is different and this might not work for you.

It can be any colour, shape, it can be pants, a blouse, a dress, a skirt, whatever.  Although I do have an actual LBD that I've owned since 2010, it's magic. But like, black suits me, and its basically just an a-line dress is a semi-suiting fabric.	episode_done:True
text:Overdressing - Discussion	labels:Oh god. I'm instantly reminded of the embarrassment I felt whenever I showed up to a pregame for a frat formal and then realized it was SEMIFORMAL. I was there in a long red gown and everyone was in minidresses... I already felt out of place because I wasn't in a sorority, just was dating a guy in the frat. Thankfully I begged my bf at the time to bring me home before the formal and I changed to a better dress.  Anyway, I tend to be an overdresser. In college I felt more comfortable dressed how I wanted to rather than in big tshirts and athletic shorts or leggings. At the office, I work with a bunch of old dudes that are wearing polos at their dressiest lol. I'm perfectly fine being the odd one out there.  I think it's mostly rude to overdress whenever there's a stated dresscode. Like in my first example, I wouldn't call it "rude" but it definitely looked off.
text:I once turned up to a work Christmas do in a fairly tight red satin frock with a huge calf-length flirty skirt.  I'd been away during the business quiet time since October, and hadn't been at work to see the memo about it being casual. I got told by a (male) colleague to come along, he didn't mention any kind of dress code, so I assumed festive cocktail.  Everyone else was in jeans.	labels:Oh man I feel for you, I would have just died internally. At least like the other person said, it at least sounds like you looked great!	episode_done:True

text:Ever been censored at work because of what you wear?	labels:While I do not agree that "feminist" is a political message I would review your employee handbook and see what the written policy for teachers around dress code is. There may be a rule stating something similar to what you heard from the principal. In this case, I'd wear my shirt when I wasn't at work, even on free dress days. Students aren't employed by the school, so they have more freedom to wear casual or political clothing so I wouldn't use the argument that students wear political clothing at your school.   However, if there isn't anything about this issue in the handbook I might bring it up to administration (HR if you have someone who mediates at your school). It would be unfair to make a rule after decided they didn't like the message of your shirt. I also wonder if someone didn't complain to the principal about it? As a media specialist, I was never questioned on book selection until a parent didn't approve of their child's selected reading. Your principal might just be trying to come to the easiest solution for them by seeing if you will just unquestioningly change without following the proper protocol.   Schools can be so hostile to young teachers. I'm sad that on top of what seems to be a very challenging year you have to deal with something so petty. I would contemplate if this issue is worth the fight to you. I've seen teacher be labeled as difficult and miss out on opportunities because they have challenged their higher ups.   Best luck! Would love a follow up.

I'll do it for dresses because photos get taken at formal events and I want those to look perfect.

I also wear a tooon of sweaters and almost none have a shoulder seam that supposed to hit at your shoulder, plus it doesn't matter if it's too loose/tight, I just buy the size I like the fit on.   If I worked in a field that required business wear, I'd probably do it more, but my current style wouldn't benefit much from tailoring.

text:Are your glasses part of your style?	labels:I've worn glasses since I was 18 mos old. So its not so much of a style thing as an adaptive device type thing. But I do have the luxury (low prescription) of whatever type of frames I want to have, so that's nice. I dont think about how they work with my clothing at all, more so how they work with my facial structure.  I also will not personally order any glasses online. My two eyes have significantly different prescriptions and I have a slight lazy eye, so I dont trust them to get the pupillary distance correct. I've had bad experiences before with online services so I stick to my optometrist.  Also, I only ever have one pair of glasses because I get headaches when I switch them. So def not fashiony lol
text:I've done both, and your prescription includes the pupil distance your optometrist uses, so it's not really any different. The only thing is that when you go in person, if your glasses need adjusting (like physical manipulation), they do that. However, there's not much to adjust on plastic frames, and laying down on the couch squishes metal adjustments anyway, so, eh. Basically, the optometrist works with the exact same numbers, so after doing it once, I got over it and won't go back. If your insurance covers the frames and lenses completely though, might as well get the in person experience ü§∑	labels:I've done it before at a similar place. They take their own pupillary distance, and they did it incorrectly. They also messed up and did not account my lazy eye after I wrote to them specifically to point it out.  Its great if Zenni specifically uses the optometrists numbers, but some other similar places do not.	episode_done:True

The closest I could find is [this one that connects to the ear instead.](https://m.aliexpress.com/item/33057876757.html?trace=wwwdetail2mobilesitedetail) essentially it just a nose ring with a chain that hangs down onto a brooch which is usually pinned on to a blazer. I would love to find one some day, however it does seem quite hazardous.  - Victorian walking stick / Parisol - I just know both would look fantastic with my wardrobe. A [parisol ](https://www.worthpoint.com/worthopedia/black-battenburg-lace-gothic-lolita-1692896768) like this would be oh so stylish and perfect for avoiding the sun and a [victorian walking cane ](http://www.catwalkyourself.com/fashion-dictionary/walking-stickcane/) such as this one would match my velvet blazer perfectly. Could also make for great self defense as historically they are weighted at the top for said reason!   - Art Dolls - so this one may need the most explanation and isn‚Äôt too serious but I feel carrying around one of these stylish beautiful art pieces in the same fashion rich teens carry chihuahuas would truly make me feel like the glam eccentric crazy artsy lady I have always dreamed of being. Truly a fun accessory. Especially if I could get its outfit to coordinate mine. I like animal ones like [This one](https://www.etsy.com/listing/712535682/stuffed-wolf-animal-art-doll-animal-wolf) but my absolute favorite dream one to own would be [This over 1,000 dollar anime one ](http://dolkus.com/mobile/detail.php?id=40202) .

text:What did your mom teach you about fashion/style - and what did she not teach you?	labels:I was an incredibly difficult fit growing up. Long long legs and skinny like a beanpole and I didn‚Äôt fully develop till like 18! Finding clothes that fit in the waist and were long enough was a challenge. (honestly still is- my inseam is 32 and I‚Äôm only 5 ft 9) My mother was curvy like a pear shaped lady. We often went on group shopping missions. So we‚Äôd go looking for a specific thing for me and specific thing for her on the same day. She‚Äôd help me then I‚Äôd help her. Being on opposite sides of the size range I got to see the challenges of both being ‚Äúplus‚Äù and ‚Äúsmaller then average‚Äù sized. I learned very quickly size is just a number and fit is much more important. My mom would stress the value of clothes that fit. Even when I was really little she would say things like that skirt is cute but can you play on the play ground in it with out it falling off? She also never hesitated to try new styles with me if I wanted to but stressed comfort and confidence above all else. She would alter clothes that we couldn‚Äôt get to fit. I had lots of jeans that she put cool pretty fabrics on the bottom of them so they weren‚Äôt too short. That my friends were so jealous of. Or skirts that she added elastic too so they‚Äôd fit my skinny waist. That and she used to sing this song that I still use as a guide for getting dressed for professional things ‚Äúraise your hands touch your toes if anything shows go change your clothes‚Äù  I had a pretty cool mom!	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- November 02	labels:I‚Äôm trying to pick out an overcoat for this upcoming winter and the foreseeable future to wear to work. I‚Äôve looked around the subreddit but it‚Äôs hard to gauge the quality of lower tier versus mid tier options for a balmacaan or topcoat. Example: Bonobos overcoats versus one from UNIQLO. The wool content and shape seem similar but I‚Äôm wrong I think. Is it even worth it to buy something at this price point? Or is waiting several years for a higher quality coat worth it?  Edit: I‚Äôm also having trouble finding places for mid tier overcoat options. Some tips on where to look would be helpful too.
text:I mean the leap from uniqlo to bonobos isn't a whole lot like going from jcrew factory to jcrew or gap to BR  What's your budget?	labels:Damn that‚Äôs good to know.

text:Model poses while online shopping	labels:Online shopping is always risky for sure. I definitely shop at stores that show more than one model on their whole site in a variety of different garments alongside their slimmer counter parts. I also shop at sites that mention the height of the model and what she is wearing as well as the choice to change the model on a garment I am looking at. So I shop at American Eagle, Madewell, Everlane, Target and Old Navy. I have never had a problem with shipping or a garment falling apart with Madewell but I definitely agree to only buy Madewell items on sale.	episode_done:True

text:What's an "outdated" item you still love and wear although the style has fallen out of fashion?	labels:Low rise jeans - you can pry them from my cold dead hands.

text:Yeah I tried some high rise jeans but it seemed so uncomfortable to me.	labels:I have found that if they are loose enough in the waist to sit down comfortably in, they are loose enough in the waist to look stupid when I stand up. I'm probably missing something	episode_done:True
text:What do you think are the pieces of jewelry everyone should own?	labels:Speaking as someone who makes jewelry, I don't think there are any items that "everyone should own". The things you mentioned are probably the most popular, and therefore many many women do own those things, but it doesn't make them for everyone. I own a pair of diamond studs I inherited from my grandma and I think I've worn them once, to a funeral - just not my style.  HOWEVER I do think that it is good to think of different shapes/colors when you are building your collection. So, owning stud earrings, as well as earrings of different lengths and sizes, and different colors/metals. Owning necklaces of different lengths that work with different shirt collars. I think everyone should own at least some impractical jewelry that you wouldn't want to wear all day, for special occasions.  I encourage people to think outside the box, shop small boutiques, local art schools, makers markets... see what's out there! My own personal favorite piece of jewelry (that I think is very adaptable!) is a bolo tie made out of a rodent skull that I made myself.	episode_done:True

text:What niche do you feel is missing from the fashion blogging/YouTube world?	labels:Midsized women who want to be fashionable, but not in a professional/streetwear sense. I've found some size twelve ladies who dress neat and tidy and ready for law practice, and I follow some size 12 ladies who wear streetwear, but nobody wears anything of actual interest in that size between either spectrum. Anybody I do see not in those two categories seem to be more in a "Macy's catalogue, 2013" aesthetic.

text:Brooks Brothers's Future Looks a Lot Like Menswear‚Äôs Past	labels:* Less SKUs. The amount of stuff BB sells is overwhelming.  * Do away with there weirdly named fit system. Change it to Extra Slim, Slim, Regular, Thicc Daddies * Revamp the BB website. It's been terrible for a long time. * Have the athleisure stuff, but also focus on high quality basics, again with less SKUs. Have something like an "essentials" line. The Navy Suit. The Charcoal Suit. The OCDB. The Chino. The Wool Trouser. Without fifty million variations thereof. You go now and it's like here are three navy suits with different kinds of stretch, here are four more with some kind of temperature controlling fabric. Just give me a half to full canvas lined 100% wool navy suit in various fits and sizes. In other words, simplify your menswear line to cut down on SKUs, and that will give you more room to play with sheep on skis and stuff (i think that does sound kind of cute, very Ralph Lauren). * Do away with Golden Fleece, Red Fleece. Mainline only. Again confusing to the consumer. * Where BB could play more is in areas like sport shirts. By all means offer your classics like blackwatch etc., but other menswear shops like Sid Mashburn or Todd Snyder offer all kinds of fun prints and colors while still feeling like classic #menswear.  i dunno, just riffing my own personal desires for BB. i don't know anything about running a large clothing manufacturer and retailer.

text:What is the breakdown of $ spent for various outfits you actually wear?	labels:The MSRP versus sale/secondhand price-actually-paid thing is pretty huge. I buy most things on sale or on eBay/Grailed/etc. The most expensive MSRP piece in my wardrobe is an Eidos Napoli Chesterfield that somebody probably paid over $1200 for, but I got it for $250 on eBay. So just that one thing, which I wear all the time, is ‚Äúpadding‚Äù the price of my outfit by $1000 every time I wear it.  What I wore yesterday / typical outfit: - Levi‚Äôs sherpa jacket ‚Äî $125 MSRP / $60 sale - Columbiaknit rugby shirt ‚Äî $80 MSRP / no sale - J. Crew 770 chinos ‚Äî $80 MSRP (hah!) / $20 sale - Greats Royale sneakers ‚Äî $180 MSRP / $100 sale - Total fit ‚Äî $465 MSRP / $260 actually paid  That outfit doesn‚Äôt contain any great steals, but it cost me $200 less than MSRP, and most of those pieces get so much wear in so many different outfits that the price-per-wear is in single digits for everything but the rugby shirt.  The biggest gap I can come up with from my wardrobe: - Aforementioned Eidos Napoli Chesterfield - ~$1200 MSRP / $250 paid - Boglioli unstructured blazer - ~$1000 MSRP / $150 on ThreeDifferent - Brooks Brothers MiUSA OCBD - $140 MSRP / $45 sale - Zegna mainline corduroy trousers - $600 MSRP / $35 on Poshmark - Meermin suede chukkas (seconds) - $250 MSRP / $80 on eBay - Total outfit: $3190 MSRP / $560 actually paid  The gap there is a whopping $2630, which I‚Äôm nonetheless unable to sell to my wife as ‚Äúsavings.‚Äù
text:I'm glad you included both prices, I should have asked for that.  For me I consider MSRP mostly marketing (for most companies). I make exceptions for companies that never have massive sales.. maybe once a or twice a year at most and their MSRP is actually true.  &#x200B;  I try to never pay MSRP but overall that probably just leads to more buying and more mistakes with sometimes less than ideal return policies. Overall I've probably "saved" money but have spent more than I would have if I completely ignored the concept of sales. I guess I've fallen for the marketing and sale hype...	labels:MSRP versus sale price versus second hand price dramatically changes the numbers. I bought Allen Edmond seconds on ebay and paid $90 for a pair of shoes that usually go for $200 but sometimes cost as much as $400.	episode_done:True
text:Your favourite men's style shopping "hacks"	labels:This is probably opposite of most of the advice here, but I advocate for buying *exactly* what you want and not worrying about sales/price etc (assuming it fits your budget). I'd rather a few garments I love than many that are ok/fine.  Edit: NB that this is with the caveat that you have a good understanding of what you like and what works for you. If you're new to the idea of dressing well or with intention, it may be worth holding off on springing for things.
text:I think this is an underrated take.  Buy what you want, and you're less likely to want to replace it.  Figuring out what it is that you want can be a challenge at times though. But it's often how you can find value. I wanted a tee shirt that looked nice, and the blanks do the job *for me* as an example.  I also wanted a KS traveler coat, so I bought one.  *edit	labels:Exactly. I spend more on my boots, denim, jackets and watches since I place high value on these parts of my wardrobe. On the other hand, I go cheap on all my shirts for some reason (button ups, flannels, tees, etc). I'm perfectly fine rocking a ratty old Hanes tee with $350 Iron Hearts and $600 Wescos.	episode_done:True

text:How much was your most expensive fashion item and when or how often do you wear it?	labels:My most expensive items are my Native American Turquoise jewelry and my cowboy boots. Just purchased a huge $900 squash blossom necklace and have worn it constantly. My boots range from $30 for a secondhand pair to $750 for custom made and none are worn more or less than the others.  When my mother passed, she was 88. I went to clean out her closet and drawers and found so many lovely things that were carefully boxed away or wrapped in tissue that she was ‚Äúsaving for good‚Äù. Ironically, ‚Äúgood‚Äù apparently never came as these things went unused.  I decided right then to never do that. Every day is special and I am worth taking the time to look and feel special even if I‚Äôm just out running errands.
text:So jealous! I want a squash blossom badly, I love a big statement necklace worn with all black.	labels:Meeee toooooo! Almost everything else I wear is thrifted, so I save a ton of money on clothes every year. This allows me to put aside $100-$150 a month to save up for these types of purchases. My husband is all for it because we share some of the larger cuffs and certain necklaces/bolos, so he paws through the collection too when we get dressed to go out.	episode_done:True
text:What are some differences between stereotypical Millennial and Gen Z fashion/aesthetics?	labels:I‚Äôve seen a couple comments saying gen z is into early y2k fashion, but that‚Äôs been popular among millennial tumblr hipsters where I live since at least 2012. I still think it‚Äôs cute but I think it‚Äôs funny when people act like it‚Äôs some new obsession. The main difference I think is that in general teens and 20-22 year olds are more like to wear risqu√© clothing, and clothing with like cutesy, adolescent vibes to it which a lot of early 2000/ kitschy stuff had, like a sleeveless top with a butterfly on it, a mini skirt, and multiple barrettes in your hair.   But I‚Äôm guessing they are referring to a lot of sustainable brands going for a simplistic, classic, professional vibe. I think that‚Äôs partly because they have a limited selection so they need to be versatile, and their target demographic is probably young professionals since they have to be more expensive than what a lot of people are used to. I‚Äôve always hated that when trying to find vegan shoes, a lot of them look very ‚Äúsafe‚Äù or business casual-y
text:Yeah, this may be a false memory (and I‚Äôm too lazy to check) but I feel like I‚Äôve seen many threads on this sub before discussing why sustainable brands are so ‚Äúboring/matronly/boxy/etc.‚Äù I just wanted to bring this up cuz I feel like it relates to what you‚Äôre saying.	labels:Could you guys give me an example of sustainable brands?

text:Sculptural Fashion Inspiration Album	labels:I've been v interested in getting more deeply into browsing runway fashion - how do you do it? Vogue website? Do you just look at the shows by designers that you like or is there a way to find new ones you'd like? I've checked out several but I definitely don't have the grasp on or fluency of high fashion that I wish I did
text:Vogue has the most shows, so if you just want to see what's out there it's a good place to look. It can be overwhelming though because there's so much.   I approach it similarly to music. If I see a piece or a look from a designer, I look at the collection it's from and some of the designer's other work, just like if I like a song I listen to a bunch more from that artist. Pinterest gets a lot of hate, but that's one way I find new designers. Once I spent a bit of time there and basically trained the algorithms for stuff I like, I've found it does a decent job of presenting me with other things I like. Then I google image search the new stuff to learn more about the designer.  Instagram is another good one. I follow designers, reposting accounts, and stores that stock designers I like. That way when they post something new I'm more likely to like it too. Looking at the designers' pages and what accounts they follow can also help.  This sub is also good for finding new designers. People post runway threads during fashion weeks (January for Fall/Winter and June for Spring/Summer). Inspiration albums like this are posted a couple times a week (most are less controversial than this one). We've had a couple threads where people post their favorite collections or inspo albums. It could be good to bring that back and make it a semi-regular thing.  It'll be overwhelming at first, but as you hone in on what you like it becomes easier to tune out what's not for you. That way you spend less time looking at stuff you definitely won't like.	labels:I've definitely been trying the "music" approach, would like to do that more in the future!   The Pinterest and Instagram ideas are very intriguing, as an artist I currently just use Pinterest for reference images but I like this idea quite a lot. I wonder if there are some useful more visual Twitter accounts too lol. I should certainly make sure to check out this subreddit more during those particular times too.	episode_done:True
text:What is something you've heard as fashion advice that isn't worth following?	labels:I remember when what not to wear was a show and I would regularly tune in because it was one of few fashion outlets I had. I quickly noticed that when it came to women who don't fit the mold of social standards they always put them in empire waists or wrap dresses. Not to mention it was always cookie cutter fashion too. No deviation. Very little personality. It would drive me insane.   The other part I had trouble with in regards to that show was their insistence that you had to use a large budget and get more expensive staples. I don't fully disagree with this. I think that people have this idea that more is better; even when the higher volume is ill fitting and mediocre. BUT if you have a clear plan you can buy a lot of good quality staples for much less. Consignment, thrift, yard sale, clothing swaps etc. The key is to not impulsively buy, but to carefully look for the items on your list. This tactic also makes the item waaay more meaningful. At least to me.

text:What did your mom teach you about fashion/style - and what did she not teach you?	labels:My mom taught me that tank tops were for whores and if I wore them it was only to make boys look at my chest (not because it was hot out?), that shorts showed off the "cellulite" on my 16-year-old thighs (oh hello lifetime of body image issues!), and that any form-fitting shirt was an open invitation to "those boys that were only after one thing" (referring to my male friends, many of whom I am still friends with, and married to one of them, 25 years later and are all the most anti-misogynistic people I know). She also questioned the size of any piece of clothing I tried on (really, JBT-Lover, a size MEDIUM??? Are you sure you don't need a large? I'm 5'7" and 125 lbs btw, but it's always nice to hear that you definitely look a whole size larger than you are during every shopping outing.)   She did not teach me that clothing was an expression of who YOU are, not of the people who might be looking at you. Moms... *eyeroll*
text:This reminds me of the time (in the 90s) that my dad told me, when I was in high school, ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter how much a woman weighs as long as it‚Äôs less than 120 pounds.‚Äù    I don‚Äôt think he was being mean, he was just ignorant.  He wouldn‚Äôt have known if I was 5‚Äô1‚Äù or 5‚Äô7‚Äù, and he probably couldn‚Äôt have narrowed my age down to the exact year either.  He just had this weird number in his head and decided to project it onto me and all females, apparently.	labels:I was always chubby, I didn‚Äôt pay much attention to the scale. It was in the parents bathroom and not in my view so easy to ignore and disregard.   (But I would be happy to be back to my high school size and weight!)  I remember reading an article about Gabby Reece when I was a teen and she was 175-180 at the time and modeling so that was my clue that weight was meaningless!	episode_done:True

text:Brooks Brothers's Future Looks a Lot Like Menswear‚Äôs Past	labels:* Less SKUs. The amount of stuff BB sells is overwhelming.  * Do away with there weirdly named fit system. Change it to Extra Slim, Slim, Regular, Thicc Daddies * Revamp the BB website. It's been terrible for a long time. * Have the athleisure stuff, but also focus on high quality basics, again with less SKUs. Have something like an "essentials" line. The Navy Suit. The Charcoal Suit. The OCDB. The Chino. The Wool Trouser. Without fifty million variations thereof. You go now and it's like here are three navy suits with different kinds of stretch, here are four more with some kind of temperature controlling fabric. Just give me a half to full canvas lined 100% wool navy suit in various fits and sizes. In other words, simplify your menswear line to cut down on SKUs, and that will give you more room to play with sheep on skis and stuff (i think that does sound kind of cute, very Ralph Lauren). * Do away with Golden Fleece, Red Fleece. Mainline only. Again confusing to the consumer. * Where BB could play more is in areas like sport shirts. By all means offer your classics like blackwatch etc., but other menswear shops like Sid Mashburn or Todd Snyder offer all kinds of fun prints and colors while still feeling like classic #menswear.  i dunno, just riffing my own personal desires for BB. i don't know anything about running a large clothing manufacturer and retailer.

text:What are some differences between stereotypical Millennial and Gen Z fashion/aesthetics?	labels:I was just thinking about this the other day! So get ready for a novel, haha. This is coming from someone pretty much in the middle of the Millennial years, and I don't super keep up with Gen Z tik tok/youtubers so this is really just based on my own personal experience and what I've observed in person at the mall, etc.  I think we Millennials were/are into very eclectic, "creative" if you will looks.... creative as in we all kind of wanted to look like artists or folk singers or, in my case at least, my hippy-dippy  mom. Cardigans, plain dark skinny jeans, toms shoes or sandals, floral dresses, cross body bags, general "slouchy" appearance, and I guess you could say librarian-esque. We brought this into the work place with long cardigans, skinny black pants, jewel tones, floral blouses, menswear blazers and loafers. At least at my work, people have mentioned we're kind of the first generation to just stop wearing heels altogether.   To me, Gen Z fashion seems very sleek, sporty, and I don't mean this in a bad way, but plain. Either that or something you took from your mom (mom jeans) or dad (super oversized hoodie). Solid neutral colors, no patterns, very little detailing, fewer logos unless it's the focal point of their outfit. Black leggings or joggers, white sneakers, plain colored crop tops, oversized denim jackets, plain hoodies and hoop earrings. Everything looks very clean and new and bright, while we kind of wanted our clothes to look lived in or vintage. At least from what I've seen, I really don't see Gen Z girls wearing anything that looks remotely thrifted, other than the mom jeans I guess? So it's interesting to see other people equating Gen Z with thrifting!  One of the first things I started noticing about Gen Z (in my area at least) is that they all seem to have SUPER LONG, shiny hair. I mean there were maybe 10 or 15 girls in my whole high school with hair that long, but I frequently see girls now with hair down to their lower back or butts. I'm still confused if these are extensions or their real hair??   At least when I was in college, shorter, tousled looking hair and bangs were definitely in. Although, as someone with very curly hair (who often feels like I'm not able to partake in current hair trends... side bangs anyone?) I feel that long, straight, shiny hair always has, and will probably always be, in style. Dark hair seems more in style with Gen Z, where as I think Millennnials were more into blonde or "bronde" or ombre.  I'm having a hard time with the makeup, because I considered Millennials (my generation) as wearing a lot of makeup... heavy cat eye eyeliner, dark matte lips, etc, and Gen Z seems very neutral (with the addition of the huge eye lashes), but it seems like a lot of people feel differently. I might just feel this way because I never really wore a lot of makeup and many of my friends did. I think Gen Z can definitely do their makeup better than we could at their age, thanks to youtubers!
text:Gen Z is also into tie dye, and old worn sweatshirts and tshirts with tourist prints, sports team stuff, animals etc so that always looks thrifted. But thrifted clothes don't have to look old, or worn. Also bear in mind a lot of what they are thrifting is what we were buying new when we were teenagers - all that y2k/2000s stuff is coming up.to 20 years old, the threshold for being considered vintage. Their vintage is not necessarily the "granny" style or 80s stuff Millenials would be getting at their age. Hope that doesnt make you feel too old!	labels:All very true! As I said this is really just based on my overall impressions of what I've observed in person, so I'm sure other people are seeing other things, especially those that actually keep up with Zoomers (god I hate that term) online.   After posting I also considered that living in the suburbs, most of the Gen Z girls I see are likely high school aged, as opposed to college-aged. Personally I know my style changed a lot from 18-20 when I went from preppy high school polos to more "hipster college girl" apparel... so I'm sure there is something similar at play for Gen Z.	episode_done:True

text:Does anyone else not factor in pants when creating outfits? How to move away from this?	labels:Black jeans make stuff more dressy. Grey jeans match well with pastel colours or with black tops.

Real pants can be more difficult to find a nice cut and length, but if you find a check or pattern you like then those are always the pants I reach for first- it is nice if you have a check with a tiny bit of colour in it cause then it pairs well with plain tops in that colour.

Going back to Taiwan and shopping at their countless department stores and small brands is always one of my favorite pastimes. It wasn't until recently that I started to appreciate how Taiwan takes inspiration from China, Japan, France, and America to create their own vibrant fashion culture. A few months ago,  I did some research on Taiwanese designers and here are two of my favorites:  * [Professor. E](https://professor-e.com/collections) \- Definitely a little out there in terms of product styling, but I find each individual piece to be quite wearable if you're into menswear/menswear-inspired silhouettes. A little Rick Owens, a little historical fantasy. * [Jenn Lee](https://www.jennleeshop.com/) \- She was a former intern at Alexander McQueen, and I can see that house's influence in her designs. Nipped in waists, sharp tailored lines, and a flair for the dramatic. She blends punk and romance ([this trench](https://www.jennleeshop.com/products/handdye-silver-coat) is like WHOA to me)

text:How do your clothes wear out?	labels:one of my favourite dresses is a purple tie dye dress from BooHoo.  It's a long sleeved smock dress, backless and has a thin cord across the shoulders from one sleeve to the other which holds it up. Without the strap, the dress is so loose that the whole thing would fall down.  So, I was on a night out, I was talking enthusiastically and waving my arms around when I felt a twang and my dress start to slip. The cord holding it up had snapped. My colleague had to bite a hole in the tiny bit of material by the sleeve and tie the cord back on, otherwise my dress would have been around my ankles.  So, integral part of the dress snapped, is how my clothing fell apart.

text:Transition Lenses/Glasses	labels:I‚Äôve had them on and off since the 90s... (thought they were super cool when I was a kid).. they ARE cool, but the worst part about them is they don‚Äôt stay dark while you‚Äôre driving, so somewhat useless to me. As others have mentioned glasses are pretty cheap nowadays so getting spare shades is the way to go. At the moment my back up pair is transition. Oh and no one will ever notice or care that your glasses are transition, and people don‚Äôt actually have an opinion on them. Also‚Äî when you‚Äôre inside they‚Äôre completely clear like regular glasses.
text:No for sure, you are right it definetly is wroth it I think  It's just for me, it came down to look, if I get transition I had to go 1 size up, so I could have sunglass look, but when it turns white it would look kinda big on me indoors and I didn't want that as I am more indoor than outdoor  If I got my size, then transitions as sunglasses would look small on me outdoor, and would give me this Matrix Morpheus look, plus taking photos - not always do I want shades, I want my eyes to speak  &#x200B;  but yeah if you have big frames already, and mostly plastic, transition would work, but I decided I will either make my old glasses as tinted sunglasses or buy new aviator sunglasses from cheaper online place (just gotta figure out which one is good, I did buy from Firmoo before) - idk what else is good  &#x200B;  but for you - I suggest lookign up at different transition models - there is one xtractive or something that gives more tint when behind the wheel - they got many models for different needs, times and so on	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Using Pinterest to Help Find Your Style (or: how to tell Pinterest it is no longer 2012)	labels:This sort of goes along with what you said about searching by style icon or person, but I also try to identify some influencers/stylists on Pinterest that mirror my body type even if I‚Äôm not into their style simply to pay attention to the proportions they use and the silhouettes that flatter them.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 26, 2020	labels:Any thoughts on what the best color Apple Watch to get? I'm between silver or black.   I feel like silver is more neutral and would look better with more watch bands and outfits, but I feel like most Apple Watch bands for men are designed for black Apple watches. Also, I'm worried that my watch will inevitably look too feminine too work with my outfits.
text:Your last concern is unfounded, most people don‚Äôt pay that much mind to masculine/feminine even with clothing that explicitly reads that way. I really hate breaking clothing down that way because it‚Äôs so restrictive- why limit yourself in watch color for some arbitrary perception that it‚Äôs not ‚Äúmanly enough‚Äù? It‚Äôs silly, but it‚Äôs a trap so many guys fall into because they let themselves fall victim to a perceived standard of masculinity that doesn‚Äôt even exist in many cases.  Aside from that a silver watch doesn‚Äôt say ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù in the slightest, and it‚Äôs neutral so it go with most bands. Get whatever color you think looks best.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:(UPDATE) Ladies who miss fashion/makeup/getting dressed up... how are you doing?	labels:I really, really miss going out to fancy parties and dinners with a lot of people. I usually spend a lot of time getting ready (and finding a pretty dress). I love feeling beautiful and glamorous and meeting new people (who are also wearing pretty clothes).   I do get dolled up at home sometimes. Drink some expensive wine and listen to classical music and daydream about the day when events like that will be possible to attend. But wearing fancy clothes and heavy makeup doesn‚Äôt feel right when I‚Äôm just sitting at home, alone.   Once I invited a friend over to drink wine, she was also dressed up, we took some photos of each other and then we had a dance party in my little apartment. I‚Äôll probably do that again soon.

text:Rant - I'm fed up with fashion and "expressing myself"	labels:Honestly, about the whole ‚Äúi live in a community where you always have to be chic etc etc‚Äù forget it. just say fuck it. I live in a very conservative Hispanic family/community and go to the only private school in the area where all the rich white kids happen to go. There‚Äôs definitely no room to be unique or dress how you want. It‚Äôs always expensive trendy or trendy. I personally strive for an alternative aesthetic (kinderwhore because I believe in its message and like all other fashion, is a form of expression) but I held back because I thought people would think I was weird. Then one day I just said fuck it. And big did a lot of people disapprove. The thing is,,,,I really don‚Äôt care. They can talk their shit and run their mouths but it means nothing to me. I‚Äôm happy and I‚Äôve found my favorite people on the world that accept me and see me as a badass. We all love each other and express ourselves differently. The problem is if you never put yourself out there, you‚Äôll never find your people. You‚Äôll always be scared of doing what makes you happy, anxious about you wear, and end up with something you hate. I‚Äôm not going to lie and say I wasn‚Äôt scared because I definitely was scared I would be rejected by everyone. That fear is what held me back. The fear of the very small chance that no one was like me/would accept me and I‚Äôd be alone. But it‚Äôs a big world. There‚Äôs literally 0% chance of that happening. Let‚Äôs get real. And who knows, maybe you‚Äôll be the reason someone else decides to express themselves freely too.

text:Does anyone invest in real jewelry?	labels:Reddit/America constantly pulls out their "diamonds are worthless" card - which tells me that the majority of Americans actually don't invest in fine jewelry (assuming most people reading are going to be from the US). Investment grade diamonds hold their value.  Jewelry as an investment was typically leveraged by unemployed women who had to find ways to hide money from their husbands. Now that women are relatively more liberated, there are better ways to invest/store your emergency fund.  Solid gold jewelry is really impractical if you want to actually wear it; it's hard to justify 24k gold jewelry when there are better ways to invest in gold as a store of value (or invest in commodities at large as a store of value). Same with fine jewelry in general. It's similar to the "pick three" trade off - do you want investment-grade, aesthetic, and reasonably priced? IME it's extremely hard to find all three and I'm too lazy to go custom.  My every day jewelry is demifine. Gold is 14k and price is like $300+ per piece. I'm not willing to go full fine jewelry prices - 2k for a gold bracelet with natural diamonds that aren't quite investment grade isn't worth. It's like... buying a print vs the original painting, and also answers your question of, "Can the younger generation afford jewelry?" Generally no, but of the ones who can, tastes are changing. 1) The push towards experiences over goods and 2) (but maybe more geared towards the west coast) people would rather buy the latest tech over luxury goods. (How many people do you know who own a $1k+ smartphone or laptop vs people who own a $1k piece of jewelry?)
text:Investing in diamonds is never a good strategy. The reason they cost so much to begin with is because on average it takes about a year to sell one. In a year that you have sunk into the inventory you could be using your money to make money in other avenues of investment that are much quicker to liquidate like stocks, bonds, or other securities.  Unless you're talking about a one of a kind diamond that most people here can't afford, I would highly discourage anyone from buying them thinking that they hold value. Auctions cost money, ebay takes a cut, any reseller or consignment store will want their cut of the profit, etc.  Gold is also not 300$ per piece. You should consider doing research as second hand gold often sells per gram per the daily spot price of the commodity on the global markets.... 1 gram of 18k gold was going for 40 or 45$ so if you wanted a necklace you factor the amount of gold you are getting into the price to make your decision. You can have 2 gram 20 inch necklace and 0.5 gram 20 inch necklace... doesnt mean they are both worth even remotely the same. A 2 gram necklace you may be able to get from pawn shops for under 100$ if you're lucky. Really depends on the owner of the shop.   Anyways you shouldn't ever buy gold if they dont list how many grams you are getting. Almost always a sign they are going to be flimsy especially if they're inexpensive.	labels:What you're saying is correct, but ignores the reality of (primarily) women who have had to rely on selling jewelry to fund an escape/collapse of government, which is what I was trying to highlight in my original comment.   >Gold is also not 300$ per piece.  When did I make this statement? I said the pieces I buy are expensive because I'm paying for mediocre quality (14k gold, semi precious gems) and trendy design. The premium is associated with the design; I don't expect my pieces to hold value if I resold them. (And I would go on to generalize that this applies to 95% of jewelry sold in the US.)  >Anyways you shouldn't ever buy gold if they dont list how many grams you are getting. Almost always a sign they are going to be flimsy especially if they're inexpensive.  Agreed with you there! This is really hard to do with the stores FFA loves imo. Most of the pieces are gold filled at best, so weighing them isn't helpful. This comment also makes me extremely nostalgic - when I was younger I would go to jewelry stores with my grandmother and watch them weigh shit for her so she could decide whether or not she was getting a good deal LOL	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - October 27	labels:Maybe a question, but semi-discussion... Have any of youguys ever returned a commission, or had a garment you‚Äôve commissioned turn out **very** underwhelming?    I commissioned a bespoke jacket back in July from a new tailor ‚Äî we agreed on the price and features; full canvas, hand sewn holes, Milanese buttonhole, hand double pick stitching. Really just hand finishings. The canvas was to be machine attached and the lapel machine padded. Fine, I was happy with the price.   Today, I went to try it on, it‚Äôs clearly half canvas with machined holes and machine pick stitching (single row). I didn‚Äôt accept the garment, but I‚Äôm not sure where to go from here. It‚Äôs clearly nowhere close to what I ordered, and I‚Äôm not sure if I ask for a remake, try for a refund, or agree on an adjustment in price?   For comparison I paid close to $3,000 (Scabal cloth), for something I could get from Spier and Mackay custom for $600 (and full canvas). Obviously I know a tailor shop and an operation that sources from China is different, but the products were very similar. To add on, it was clearly not bespoke, as there was no basted fitting. I have had bespoke with no basted fittings, but with much more talented tailors.   I suppose the long and short is the tailor shop severely under delivered, and what have any of youguys done in similar situations.   Anyone have thoughts?
text:Not necessarily bespoke but I did order from a brand in India. Thought the material color and the design was interesting. Got the item and the material was literally paper thin. You could clearly see the outline of my body and pretty much my nipples. I messaged the seller, told them about it and they was like "just wear a vest underneath it". Pretty much lost my money and can't really wear the clothes can only be worn around the house. Learnt my lesson, don't order bespoke since you are going to have a bad time. There are 100 other brands out there that produce better things for the same price you were going to get it bespoke.	labels:	episode_done:True

Any sort of fashion or even barely nice looking thing I wear seems to let breeze in like a fucking skirt while I'm outside. Are long johns a thing people actually wear and not just a thing in old assed shows that have a winter fishing scene?

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 15, 2020	labels:Hey all, I am getting ready to take my first plunge into buying some used dress shoes. The way I see it, I have two choices... a) Purchase a pair of barely used shoes that haven't had their cork insoles "broken in" yet, and therefore have a better chance of forming to my feet better, or b) purchase a pair of cheaper shoes (\~$50) with the plan to send them to AE for recrafting which ensures that I get a fresh cork insole, along with a completely recrafted shoe.  Thoughts?  If I go with route (b), my final cost will be around $200. So I guess I need to see if I can find some barely used shoes for less than that. If not, the recrafting option may be just as good?

text:Changing your mindset from fast fashion to one of investment pieces. What did you learn?	labels:Great post! I am in the process of a similar transition, and here are a few things that helped me.  1. **Thinking about items in terms of cost-per-use.** It might feel much easier to spend $20.00 on a top rather than $100.00, but if the $20.00 dollar top shrinks or comes apart at the seams after washing and I only wear it twice before I decide to get rid of it, the cost per use was $10.00. If the $100.00 top is well made and I wear it once a week for two years before I get rid of it, the cost per use is around $1.00. 2. **Choosing fabrics that feel good against my skin and are built to last.** I realized that I actually hated wearing cheap fabrics. Polyester and acrylic felt uncomfortable against my skin, and my search for nicer materials has led me away from fast fashion. I try to choose clothes in linen, cotton, modal, rayon, wool, and cashmere. 3. **The painful realization that I had a lot of clothing items and only felt** **enthusiastic about wearing around 20% of them.** I think this is the base for that "closet full of clothes but nothing to wear" mentality.  Ideally, you will get to a point where, even if you have a smaller number of items, they are items that you are excited to wear and that look great on you. Less really can be more, if the items are of good quality and fit you well. 4. **Rejecting bold statement pieces** for highly versatile basics that can be mixed and matched and recombined. My focus shifted to buying tops that work with all of my bottoms, and vice versa. 5. **Searching for bargains**. If you have the time and the patience, you can save a lot of money by searching through thrift shops. This works particularly well if you can go to one in a trendy or wealthy area or even an area with older residents. Some of my best pieces are from the 1960s or 1970s, and these clothes are built to last for life. If thrift shopping is not an option, you can check Facebook Marketplace, Kijii, Ebay, Thredup, Poshmark, or Etsy (there are several sellers who do thrift-shopping for you, clean and mend the clothes, and then resell them). 6. **Budgeting money for tailoring.** Even the most basic item can look fantastic if it's tailored to fit your body. Very often, if I have an item I like but I never wear, it's because it doesn't actually fit me properly. Taking in a waistline or shortening a hem are simple fixes that can make a big impact. 7. **Voting with your wallet.** I think it's great that you've decided the buy less from fast-fashion retailers. I have found a few small brands that prioritize ethical production and fair wages for their garment workers, and while sometimes I feel the sting of a high price, I remind myself that I want to help these businesses succeed and I can feel good about supporting them.  I hope this helps!
text:Thank you for all of that! I especially agree with voting with your wallet. Since I'm looking for more slow fashion, I've been especially on the look out for small designers and BIPOC designers. I would much rather my money go to a small company, even if it's more expensive, then to go towards paying for child labor and general exploitation	labels:	episode_done:True

I have some pairs of [these socks](https://www.smartwool.com/shop/athletic-light-elite-stripe-crew-socks-sw001249), classic white with black and blue stripes. I wear them with high top sneakers, but I recently saw a couple different people say they don't actually look good at all (about the socks in general, not at me). Is this true? I dress on the more casual side, if that matters.
text:Prevailing has advice held that white socks were a bit dorky at their worst or boring at best. I think that opinion is slowly changing within more progressive and on trend fashion circles.  Hell, I just bought a six pack of white socks this year for the first time in FOREVER.   But you'll still find most people have a low opinion of them, especially if talking about dressing "well". So you can take comfort that the Internet says they're fine, but you may need to accept a little bit of criticism while everyone else catches up.	labels:	episode_done:True

I've heard that Levi's are really good for their price (in America at least, from what I know they're more expensive outside of the U.S.) but I don't really like the way that they fit loosely around the butt because I just prefer the way it looks when jeans have more of a snug fit around the butt. I know there are a lot of different styles of Levi's though so if you know of a style that fits differently like that, I'd be happy to check them out! Also I bought a pair of Uniqlo jeans and I am actually pretty happy with the quality, but I'd rather support more environmentally-friendly companies if I can.

I'm an attorney and I just got a job in which the admin. assistant told me they wear "business attire" - to me that translates to suits.  I own 2 suits, I own 2 like, NICE white dress shirts that fit, I have plenty of ties.  Guys, how the FUCK do people wear suits every day? How many dress shirts do I need? How many suits do I need? Can I wear the same shirt twice before dry cleaning? Do people do that? How often should I hit up the dry cleaners? Can any of this stuff be normal washed?  I'm sort of lost any help is appreciated.
text:I'm an attorney. My office is business casual, but I'm always comfortable in a suit.  1. Make sure everything fits well. It won't look good or feel comfortable if it doesn't fit well. Try moving your arms and sitting down and all that when you're testing fit. It doesn't need to be slim or skinny -- skinny fits are out, and a classic fit is more professional. 2. A rotation of... 6-10 dress shirts is probably good enough. A third suit will help when you need to get one cleaned. 3. I usually wear my dress shirts 2-3 times (or until the collar looks too dirty to wear) before having them washed at the dry cleaner -- I say "wash" and not "dry clean," dry cleaning a dress shirt is unnecessary and costs more. I also ask them to use low starch, and one of my cleaners is willing to fold, too -- I prefer that over wire hangers. 4. You can absolutely wash your dress shirts in your washing machine. The lower heat you use the better. Hang drying is better than tumble drying. You'll want to iron as soon as they're done drying to prevent any wrinkles from sticking. 5. Wool suits don't need to be dry cleaned too often. Once per season is fine. Maybe even less. Unless they smell or have visible stains, then you should absolutely have them dry cleaned. 6. There are machine washable "performance" suits. They don't look as good, but they are real suits, and you can get away with them. 7. You should now ask me about dress shoes. You need to think about dress shoes.  By the way, can I ask what the nearest city is? That will help if you want brand recommendations.	labels:Hey man! I'm in Houston.  I have a solid 3 or 4 brown/black dress shoes that look great. I've just always worn business casual and there, the pants (khakis/jeans) can be washed whenever, the button downs don't have stays or really require a ton of maintenance and I have like 20 of them so I just dry clean once a month or less.  This advice is great. I currently have 2 suits (one that's like a blue, and one that is grey) and 2 nice (white) dress shirts.   I don't own an iron or an ironing board, so I assume unless I want to get stuff washed at dry cleaner always I need that?  I know I'm going to be working some long hours, just trying to figure out how I'll make it by the dry cleaners and how often I'll need to go (among other things like: when to work out, how I can have time to make or get food etc).

text:Let's talk the impact of fragrance on perception of style! How much does a person's fragrance affect your impression of them? Do you choose perfume with this in mind? What are some of your favourites?	labels:I've always loved the quote of "fragrance is meant to be discovered, not announced", because it kinda reflects where I stand on fragrance *amount.* I'm always curious what people are wearing, but if it's overpowering, or the fragrance strongly lingers in the room long after someone has left it (ghost perfume!), it turns me off from the rest of the outfit and I tend to avoid the person. I'm not a fan of strong/intense smells.  I tend to associate flowery fragrances with twee and more dainty fashion choices, and more "masculine" (for lack of a better word) fragrances with alt, androgynous, and other such styles, so I tend to expect x fragrances if someone is wearing x outfit. But even if someone doesn't wear what I'm expecting, it doesn't really take away from the outfit too much.  I haven't worn fragrance in ages because my favourites were discontinued (DKNY Be Delicious and Katy Perry Meow). But based on my style nowadays (more masculine, lots of darker neutrals, odd silhouettes), I would probably choose something less sweet just to complement my outfits a bit more.
text:+1 I'm not super sensitive to scents but I think it should only be smelled inside of someone's personal bubble. Like a hug, or if we're sidling up to the bar together, or leaning in to talk in a loud place. It's obnoxious to wear it strong enough that others can smell it outside of a few feet.  I don't really match fragrances to outfits. It's just a little extra finishing touch or polished appearance	labels:	episode_done:True

I never have to think too much about what I wear and I don't really have to make any decisions after I purchase the item. My dresses are really comfortable, all of them have pockets, and I get compliments constantly. Uniform dressing sounds really boring, but you can create a fun and unique type of uniform if you want.  I tried a capsule wardrobe earlier this summer. It had dresses, shirts, pants and shorts, but I went back just dresses because the capsule was too many decisions. I just pick a dress that is clean and move on with my day, but I also still have a distinct and unique style.

text:The best plain t-shirt video guide ‚Äî 11 t-shirts bought and tested	labels:As someone that's addicted to white t-shirts and has spent many hundreds of dollars chasing the perfect look/fit,  I'll add my $0.02.      The only shirt in this video worth your time is the Asket, but even that would rank somewhere around 4th or 5th best.      JCrew makes the best white tee in the game, regardless of price, and it's thankfully cheap. With or without a pocket, the gsent dyed slub tee fits amazing and can take a wash and machine dry - most tee's can't.      Next up would be Bonobos. Also relatively inexpensive (if looking at Sunspel as your guide) and the slim fit works very well. Holds up to a wash, no bacon bullshit going on with the neck, and definitely no shrinkage.      Third I'd go straight to Alex Mill, assuming you hang dry. I've found Slub tees have the best look (personal opinion) so the white slub tee is my choice. DOES NOT hold up to machine drying, so don't be surprised when you pull out a shrunken length baby tee with an Alex Mill logo .     Fourth I'm going to Todd Snyder, but seriously, fuck his prices.      Fifth I'll give this to Asket because of what is said in this video. Personally, I dislike the long ass sleeves. If you want a more fitted athletic look, size down and roll up the sleeves. Otherwise you'll look like a nerd wearing an oversided t-shirt from the 90's. A nice looking t-shirt, but you get the point.      Sixth, toss up between Buck Mason and Wellen. See, I love the Wellen, but it's a different fabric (Hemp I believe) and offwhite, not a true white. The Buck Mason has a curved hem which is really love it or hate it. The downside, even if you love it, is that if you machine dry - instant baby tee. The Wellen doesn't have this problem.      Seventh I'm taking Taylor Stitch Heavybag Tee. It's really more offwhite than white, and it's...um...heavy. It feels like you took a carhartt jacket and cut the fucking sleeves off and called it good. I don't mind it. It's just not a "classic". Holds up to machine wash/dry really well, and fits great.      I have yet to try Sunspel, 316, Lady White (did they just stop making the Clark?) and Reigning Champ.      On order and soon to arrive is the Reigning Champ, which if it's anything like the hoodies will probably take #1 (no pressure, right?) - otherwise, I'm sticking to my list. Regardless of $$$ the JCrew garment dyed slub is the perfect white tee. Hands down.  EDIT: I had to change pima to Garment Dyed. I get shirt material name's mixed up often and just checked the tag. Which also reminds me, the BR pima is a fantastic option as well, just don't machine dry. I'd place that right around 4th with Todd Snyder for the way it fits when new.

I definitely am more masculine dressing than my straight friends and I feel like this isn‚Äôt necessarily intentional for looking bi, but still stems from my sexuality - I‚Äôm very comfortable with who I am and not dressing necessarily to look appealing to men.

Sure, an XL would fit me better, but if I buy it in a 2X it's so much comfier! I suppose my visual saving grace is that I pretty much wear exclusively black.  I recently got a sewing machine and I've been having a blast sewing myself drapey skirts and dresses that fit my esthetic (forest witch would be a good name for it.) Because I don't actually want anything to be fitted I don't bother with patterns or anything. I pretty much just play around with fabric in a way that what I make functionally works as clothes.

I would say if you are trying to be cute, the most important thing is having a bag or a locker or somewhere to stash your hat, coat, mittens, and extra layers, and having winter boots that are ok. Ive been wearing blundstones for a few years now and even tho I don't love the look its so much more low key than most winter boots so its worth it.

text:Shitpost Saturday: Fashion AITA	labels:**AITA for not wanting others to wear white at MY wedding?**  I feel like this is a fairly standard fashion etiquette rule. White is reserved for the BRIDE. How will people know who is getting married if everyone is wearing white? Just wear literally any other color!  I planned a gorgeous winter wedding last week, but so many of our guests had the nerve to show up in white. If it were just my tactless bitch cousin or something, I could make her hide in the bathroom during the ceremony and cocktail hour, but it was multiple guests! Finally, I had to put my foot down. I went to my MIL and said, "I know you love your son and it's probably hard for you to watch another woman take over washing his underwear, but I'm going to have to ask you not to wear white at my wedding. Please remove the offending item."   And she was like, "I don't feel comfortable removing my mask in a social gathering this large."  CAN YOU EVEN BELIEVE IT?   My tactless bitch cousin also wore a white mask and she had the nerve to call me a bridezilla and say she didn't even want to come to my wedding in the first place because it would probably turn into a "super spreader event and kill grandma."   Finally, I told everyone in a white mask that they could either take off their mask or leave and THEY FUCKING LEFT! It was so rude! Do they even know how much weddings cost? My caterer is like $150 a plate! And then my HUSBAND had the nerve to suggest that I was being unreasonable.

text:"Can people just hate fashion again" - Synecdoche When Talking about the "Industry" Discussion	labels:Go to the end for **TL;DR**. I'm not gonna lie, this is very tacky because it is kinda classist, condescending, and glutted by nostalgia.  >**There are immensely talented people around but I feel huge vortexes of them are sucked into this mediocre world where nobody criticizes and it‚Äôs all terribly politically correct. Even journalists are the same. You now hardly get a bad a review. In their mind the journalists are supporting the industry, so they don‚Äôt want to dish it. For me it‚Äôs that banality of what is youth.**  LOL. Girl if you want to see criticism, get out of the ivory tower and go on the internet where the people actually are giving lots of legitimate critique and investigation of fashion. You have to be patient and willing to sift through tons of crap, but I still maintain that you are being insanely nostalgic and therefore condescending to today's artists and fashion community. There are new ways to communicate with people and you need to put in the time and the effort to find them. As for the banality of what is youth? The fetishization of youth, as well as the critique of its perceived banality, is present through all of human history. Are you fucking kidding.  I do not think accessibility to fashion has diluted its creativity. It's just that the masses didn't have buying power so they were ignored; now people are shocked the masses are buying things that are supposedly exclusive and innovative and sought-after by the upper classes, who we are taught to desire to emulate by every facet of society. same type of dumb as when alexander wang had parties where he gave away clothes and was shocked people were grabbing as many as they could take. Totally disconnected and kind of embarrassing for him imo.  >Is preserving a house's brand more important than designer creativity?  It depends on the house. Alexander McQueen? probably, yes. And even then, I don't think it really matters since we've all realized at this point what he did can't be replicated. I wish his house as more of a playground for different designers to try new things. Chanel? Chanel's whole brand is making women her definition of palatable and largely inoffensive for the male gaze and society. So, no, as long as the exquisite craftsmanship that she prided herself on is still there. I also think this is a trick question because what you are really asking is "Should what a company makes be decided by the artist or the consumer?" And we both know for art to really sell, the designer has to communicate their art to the consumer very well. The decision to be subservient to the original founder's vision is up to the staff of the establishment. I also get the vibe that it is often the older artists or board members who impede the creativity of younger hires, rather than younger people failing to be creative. One of the ways youth express and react to newer ideas is by responding to trends in their own clothing, regardless of how much or how little they think about it. So I think Wilson's distaste of younger designers and students responding to trends is short-sighted, misguided, and kind of shooting herself in the foot. She's sort of just admitting she's unwilling to investigate newer methods of communication or thinks she fully understands them. She's just being impatient with the people she's gonna rely on one day.  &#x200B;  >While this post is long enough as it is, I do want to bring up one more thought around how we perceive things in reference to when we experience them. A "today's music sucks!" argument. What I remember of past collections are only of the ones that stand out, obviously I forgot the ones that didn't, and so I can have a certain feeling towards the 2009 spring/summer RTW collections because I only remember the best. But when presented with all of the collections of 2009 today, not just the hits, would I have the same feeling?  This paragraph and phrasing are an absolute mess. You're basically asking, "Are me and this woman riddled with nostalgia for the fashion industry?" And yes. Yes you are. This lady is very much that and she is devoid of interest in terms of constructively carrying over the things she finds meaningful. Is she unwilling to confront the things that meant a lot to her might not mean as much to the next generation, as she did to the generation before her? Also yes.  Feel free to reference my comment I made about the history of the incorporation of pants into womenswear elsewhere in this thread in reference to this question.  &#x200B;  >Should spaces & industries for fashion lovers, clothes lovers, and people that have to wear clothes be completely separate?  You gotta be more specific. like, do you have to have cut at least 3 original patterns to get into the first group? Do you have to be a patron of the arts? And if so, do you not realize most patrons are incredibly tacky and lots of them are just glorified clothes lovers or consumers, but yet the spaces for the artists would be impossible without them? Are we just having a bohemian meeting in the back of a tailor shop? The last one sounds pretty appealing imo. But it just sounds like you're asking if we're a rectangle or a square.  &#x200B;  >Do you think that everyone can be placed in those three groups? Would you add more, less? How would you define each? How would you identify yourself?  I think these groups are pointless and fail to effectively address what you want to address, which is basically the difference between people who are "highbrow" in their sense of "art". How could I be a fashion lover without being a clothes wearer? What kind of pretentious litmus test will I be subject to before I am allowed to rub elbows with someone who designs for gucci, a house who's current work I hate? But are they held in higher regard than someone with no sewing or design experience who's outfit choices are highly original? How is that person judged, and who by? What if someone doesn't know shit about the history of fashion, loves clothes, and wears them in an original way? How you categorize them?  >If I said "Lets talk about fashion!", what would that mean to you? (Would you start talking about style, runways, designers, other?)  It means whatever you make it mean when you start the conversation. It can be houses, trends, trend analysis, fashion history, garment construction, color study, or a legitimate study of sociology through the lense of trends and the growth of different houses throughout history. NGL the last one is my personal favorite.  **TL;DR:** I think the real conversation is basically about the integrity of art and consumerism, which isn't really stimulated in the way it needs to be by these relatively vague questions that don't address consumerism beyond feebly attempting to separate it from "true art". Fr some of this post comes off as "should poor people be allowed to buy designer clothes? Because then the burden to cater to anyone but the extreme upper classes who can fund lots of creativity will be taken off these poor oppressed highly profitable fashion houses uwu". Like do you not want people who don't present a 100 page thesis on the meaning of fashion and history of garment construction to not have access to anything other than h&m? Artists make art, people consume it, and take from it whatever they want to or can.  "sHe ReAlLy DuNkEd oN eVeRyOnE aT CeNtrAl St MaRtiN's" let's be real people who are that snobby about art are always like that because they feel threatened by popular taste and the ever-present fact that they can be overshadowed by something or someone more popular than their own work.

text:What rules do you break for your body type?	labels:I'm short, and one of the fashion guidelines I tend to read say to create long lines - this means avoiding ankle straps on shoes.

Another rule I saw was to avoid the midi length since it can sometimes be too long but not long enough to be maxi. I wear my midi length skirts high-waisted so they fall at the right point and I love them. IDC if they make me look short, they're gorgeous!
text:My feeling with this is - how can things "make you look short" if you happen to be five foot? You are short. This is fine!	labels:This is a great question! Jean Wang from Extra Petite has a great answer - [here](https://www.extrapetite.com/2010/05/reader-request-how-to-look-older-in.html) and [here](https://www.extrapetite.com/2011/02/reader-request-building-confidence.html).  You're absolutely right in that I am short. However, people are generally surprised when I tell them my height because they think I'm taller. Part of this is because I'm short, but not dainty, and I dress for the body I have. While this post is a great example of how fashion rules are not universal, there are some rules that help us dress appropriately when it comes to sizing. Standard sizes are too long - the waist falls below my natural waist, my blouses hit past my butt instead of at the hip, the arms are too long - all of these make me look short, because they are meant for a taller person. I hope this helps!	episode_done:True

The Charcoal Suit. The OCDB. The Chino. The Wool Trouser. Without fifty million variations thereof. You go now and it's like here are three navy suits with different kinds of stretch, here are four more with some kind of temperature controlling fabric. Just give me a half to full canvas lined 100% wool navy suit in various fits and sizes. In other words, simplify your menswear line to cut down on SKUs, and that will give you more room to play with sheep on skis and stuff (i think that does sound kind of cute, very Ralph Lauren). * Do away with Golden Fleece, Red Fleece. Mainline only. Again confusing to the consumer. * Where BB could play more is in areas like sport shirts. By all means offer your classics like blackwatch etc., but other menswear shops like Sid Mashburn or Todd Snyder offer all kinds of fun prints and colors while still feeling like classic #menswear.  i dunno, just riffing my own personal desires for BB. i don't know anything about running a large clothing manufacturer and retailer.

text:fabric costs can vary wildly. They might have some horrific wool/poly blends for their base price, and then various other options at higher price points.  Anything under US$1k is likely going to be made in China. Anything under US$1k has very, very little margin for a retail storefront - if they offer US$600, they are competing with online only operations that want you to measure yourself, bang them into an order form, and hope for the best. The retail storefront probably is going to spend 30-60 minutes with you measuring, going over fabrics, discussing options.  For made to measure, I would generally recommend places where you can try on the base model, and if it works 80+%, then it is worth trying via MTM.	labels:	episode_done:True

I was just about to commit to buying another pair of sneakers and it's probably the best deal I'm going to find on them, added to cart, shipping info entered, billing info entered... $20 for the cheapest shipping option. No shipping codes available, no threshold I can cross to get free shipping. $20 period, no exceptions.  It's a $300 pair of sneakers discounted to $180, I guess should be able to rationalize that at $200 (including shipping), I'm still getting a better deal than what's available anywhere else online (only a few select retailers got this colorway, and all but one are sold out in my size), but still, $20 shipping feels *wrong*. My brain has been trained from years of online shopping that there should always be some way to get around paying for shipping, or otherwise, shipping should be cheap.

text:How A Trouser Should Fit ‚Äì The Armoury	labels:Make Trousers Great Again!  When out in the wild, perhaps the most glaring modern menswear catastrophe is that many (if not most) men's pants fit very poorly. They are either baggy or tight. Personally, I think a straight fit with a very, very moderate taper is the most flattering and masculine silhouette. I find that it works well on wide, "regular," and slim guys. Tight pants make a big guy look bigger by making his legs bulge and a skinny guy look skinnier by showing exactly how thin his calves are. Baggy pants exaggerate a big man's size with too much fabric and make a skinny guy disappear. Silhouette is just as important as fit. The same applies to rises...

I don't claim to know what everyone's intentions are with regards to fit, hence why I framed this in the context of tailoring where the aim is to provide both shape and comfort equally. In a casual context, people may choose to pursue a very skinny fit in their jeans *a la* SLP, or very wideboi fits. Additionally, not everyone's intent is to achieve a conventionally "flattering and masculine silhouette".  Just wanted to point out that what may be your definition of good or poor fit may not be the same of others‚Äô, depending on their intentions which we should try not to assume :)	labels:Yes, I am just espousing my viewpoint! My subjective opinion is that trousers look best with a "flattering" and "masculine" shape.   Of course I also think it's the best viewpoint, otherwise I wouldn't hold it. I find it a bit strange how a lot of people take a very relativistic approach to style opinions. I'm not making some sort of value judgement, though I do enjoy making my claim strong and colorful. Everyone is welcome to disagree and disregard!	episode_done:True

text:Overdressing - Discussion	labels:I'd always rather be overdressed! But I find that if you use layers or accessories to dress up your outfit (like statement necklaces, earrings, cool blazers on top of a less flashy top), you can always take something off and stash it away if you get to an event and feel like your look is too much for the occasion. But I vote to wear whatever makes you feel most confident/less likely to second guess yourself.	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - October 24	labels:I read Gear Patrol's site for the first time in a while and it's gone downhill.  e.g. I read an article about how you shouldn't by cloth bath mats because they can grow mold and bacteria...  Which goes on to suggest comparatively expensive wood slat bath mats, which can also grow mold and bacteria.  Another article in the same series derides slippers, and suggests wearing $400 Gucci loafers around the house instead....     The site's OG premise was about recommending "quality goods" and all that jazz, but I guess they bought into their own bullshit and now conflate $$$$$$ w/ "Quality"  (Additionally, an anti-cold brew article in the same series as the others .references James Hoffman, a effete British snob who I would gladly kick down the never-ending stairs from Super Mario 64.)

text:Painting with a pretty broad brush but I guess you could say that about some fits.  It's just an extension of things like normcore and Dadcore... people who are interested in fashion as a hobby sometimes like the challenge of trying to make interesting outfits out of items considered unfashionable (like baggy pants and chunky dad sneakers). Get enough people who are considered fashion-forward experimenting with the same things and those things actually start to become trendy.  Same thing happened a decade ago with the guys who wore women's jeans to achieve a skinny fit and gave birth to the "slim fit" movement or the city kids working in tech jobs who wore workwear to appear ironic.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:What's the greatest length you've gone to obtain a much coveted fashion item?	labels:I'm in Canada. I once spent more on shipping  then the actual cost of the skirt.   I've also spent more on import taxes and fees then on the product itself. how does that happen? Imported items are taxed on their original, non sale price. Nevermind that retail in Canada charges tax based on the price at the register, even if it's on sale.    And the Canadian companies that ship out of the US and charge insane shipping fees to Canada - if they can even ship to Canada at all can bite my arse! (looking at you Bite and Holotaco (though Bite ceased to be Canadian in the mid 2010s))
text:Hearing these Canadian stories is so insane, but I totally get it. I live in the US and have a bestie in Toronto.

text:That‚Äôs an amazing collection! How long did it take (roughly) to amass, and if this is not too personal a question, how much would you estimate it cost to put it together (can be a rough $/year average)?  For context on the question: I prioritized building my dream closet over the last few years, but mostly ignored bags other than the bare basics. I‚Äôm finally at a point with my closet where I feel like I can pause or at least only make small additions, and can now refocus on bags. Anyway, I‚Äôve been thinking about what it will take money and time wise to build my (dream) purse collection, and you‚Äôre among the few folks I‚Äôve seen here who appear to have already done that :).	labels:To be completely transparent, because I don't want it to sound like I purchased all of these on my own, several of them were gifts from my parents: Chanel m/l, Chanel jumbo, Chanel wallet on chain, LV Neverfulls (both) and several Le Pliages. My mom gave me two of her Longchamp Le Pliage bags because she hates the handles lol. But these were all gifted over the course of several years.  She bought me my first Longchamp in 2011 I think, and I still have it.  I need to get the corners patched up but it's otherwise in working condition for me. I think they bought me my Neverfulls in 2012 when LV started selling them with the pouches. Chanel wallet on chain is from 2013 or 2014. The Chanel flaps are kind of a blur but I got my m/l and then the Jumbo the following year. My boyfriend bought me the Polene numero un mini back in...2018 I believe, for my bday.  I think I bought my Goyard in 2018 when I was in Paris. Last year I bought the Polene numero deux (now discontinued) when they were offering free shipping and I got my Furla metropolis mini on sale for $156.  This year I bought the Strathberry east west (on sale), Delvaux brillant and Polene numero un nano when they were offering free shipping.  Before I make a purchase I add it to my pinterest wishlist and i let it sit there for a month (or more) before purchasing it. I think with the exception of the Gucci wallet on chain, I've never made an impulse handbag purchase. But there's some bags I drool over only to realize it's not practical or I just don't like it. I'm looking at my wishlist from 2018 and I don't care for any of the bags now: Gucci Soho disco & Mulberry Lily for example. It's completely fine to let it sit and marinate on it.   I think cost really depends on what you want. Some people just want to have a different bag for every occasion or at least 1 bag of every style (crossbody, tote, clutch etc).   I think I am at a point where if I could not purchase any more handbags, I would 100% content since I have a bag for work, travel, errands, date night etc. But that Valextra Iside sure would make me a happy girl lol  **TL;DR**  So I guess to answer your question: it's taken about 9 years to build my collection. I've been fortunate enough to have some bags gifted to me, but I'm also on the lookout for free shipping or when the bags go on sale. It's ok to take your time to figure out what bags you enjoy that will *also* be functional and put to use. I think how much you spend per year to build your collection is very much what you're comfortable spending. I'd say depending on your taste (mid range, high end, luxury) 1 bag per year is probably the norm.  Now my personal cap would be 10K in one year unless I were buying a Birkin or Kelly, which isn't likely to happen lol	episode_done:True

text:How do you decide what clothes you ‚Äúneed‚Äù?	labels:I'm going to try and do a clothing no buy in 2021 (I can only replace athletic shoes) so take what I say with a grain of salt.  For me, it is a matter of knowing myself.  The current trends (the boxy, oversized, neutral aesthetic) do not work for my body type (pear).  The other trend that does not work for me is the cropped/ankle pants trend.  I look like a small child who just outgrew their clothes.  I also know what I do not wear (black or khaki pants--- reminds me of retail work uniforms of years past).  When I purchase something, (in my mind) it has to "pay for itself."  Meaning I have to think of at least x times that I will wear the item before I will buy it (special occasions are the rare exception).  X means the dollar amount.  So I have to wear a $30 sweater at least 30 times to make it worthwhile.	episode_done:True

text:Changing your mindset from fast fashion to one of investment pieces.

I feel pretty fortunate that I had a pretty good idea of what I liked and didn't like, but I think if you're still wanting to experiment then it may be best to stick with very specific investments. For example, I started just with shoes (I have strong preferences) and outerwear (I wanted to upgrade shapes/colors I already loved). That'll help build confidence in moving to other areas.

Lined shorts are a plus because the inner lining keeps everything together while also being super flexible, way better range of motion than wearing regular shorts and boxer briefs.

It's split into two sides with several small pockets. Holds a water bottle, my iPad, fidget toys, phone wallet keys or and some reusable grocery bags with room to spare. Could hold a laptop. This is the bag things can get lost in. I could use it for an overnight trip if I really needed to. It's the biggest purse I've owned in a long time, but I'm really loving it.   A mini backpack for bike riding days or hiking with friends. Has a mesh pocket inside and can hold phone wallet keys a sandwich and headphones. Athletic type material. I have this in black, beige and fuschia.   A canvas satchel/messenger bag for doctor's office type visits where I'll have to wait or errands that need less stuff brought along. Has a few compartments and can fit my iPad, kindle or an 8x5 book with phone wallet keys, lotion, probably some makeup if needed. I have this in brown, purple and charcoal because it's such a good bag.   A small black pleather half-moon crossbody with gold accents for quick stuff like the gas station, taking a walk or some type of event where I have to look nice. I have a similar green one and a Togepi one that can be swapped out, but I love this one the most.  I talk too much. Yay.

text:Review - The Custom Russian Automatic Dive Watch (for less than 100 Dollars)	labels:TL;DR: I bought a russian diver watch from the 60s and it is awesome.     Intro / Backstory: Recently, I was shopping for a birthday present for my father. He is in his late 50's, and since we have bonded a lot over the last few years, after years of radio silence, I wanted to make a more personal present.     My dad is a typical "man's man", who likes scotch, cigars, classic rock, fishing, boats and painting - so I usually get him something that fits either of this categories. But this year I wanted to get something different.     I opted for buying him a watch. But since neither him nore me are big watch guys, I did not want to go for a brand that he would not recognize - but a Rolex, Breitling or Glash√ºtte was not in my price range either.    So I went a differnt route: Why not get something from his past? We are both from what used to be the German Democratic Republic (the soviet part of Germany). Back in the day getting a cool watch was almost impossible. Civilians only had two kinds to pick from, which would not be cool even back then. To get a cool watch you either had to smuggle it in from the west - or you had to bribe someone to get a high end military watch. The latter were hard to get but instantly recognizable.     Since my dad was in the navy, the watch to go for was the "VOSTOK AMPHIBIA" - and I bought one for myself as well.      Quality:     To my surprise, the AMPHIBIAs were still being made, just like they were in the 60's. The VOSTOK (meaning "east") watches are made in Chistopol - and they are the AK47s of watches. The AMPHIBIA is based on a Swiss design, because during the economic crisis of the early 20th century, the Soviets bought a Swiss Watch Making Company stock, lock and barrel. They drove all the machinery and the workers deep into the Russian hinterland, where they made a watch that is pretty much indestructible.     The automatic 2416 calibre comes with 31 jewels and has been gushed over for its precision by pretty much any watch critic I read. It is waterproof to 200 meters - and it actually becomes MORE waterpoof the deeper it goes. The quality is simply incredible, which made me question other watchmakers inflated prices.     As for the design: It's not a Rolex Submariner, but it is certainly is unique. The AMPHIBIA comes in a variety of looks - and you can even design your own. Since it is proper Soviet fashion to make all parts interchangable, you can mix and match them to your liking. You can go all stainless steel, all black or even choose funky primary colors and a KGB logo.    If you picked your own casing, wristband, bezel and watchface, you will not find a similar watch within a 500 miles radius. If you want your watch to be more recognizable, you should go for one that has the SCUBA DUDE watchface.      No matter what design you pick, though - the AMPHIBIA always looks unapologetically rugged and functional.      The wristbands however, are nothing to write home about. I suggest you replace them with something else. Leather cuffs work incredibly well, because they underline the rugged look. More on that later.     The luminescent hands could also be a little bit brighter, they are kinda hard to read if you did not spend a significant time in the sunlight.      Price: You can get a new one for less than 100 bucks. Yes, you read that right. For less then 100 Dollars you can get a well made custom, automatic watch that can go toe-to-toe with most top-tier watches - as long as it comes down to functionality.  How/when to wear:   The AMPHIBIA is an interesting piece. It is made well enough to be noticed in a casual setting since it does not look like a casual watch. You can certainly wear it to any outdoor activity, since that is what it is made for.      It goes well with earthy, rugged looks as well as anything leathery. It also touches up your everyday "Jeans and well fitting T-shirt"-Look. More noisy outfits tend to drown it out, as it never really clashes with anything. Although that might be different if you picked up one of the more colorful custom ones. If you want to give the watch a little more "oomph", you could go for a broad leather cuff or even a tacticool wristband.       I wear my Vostok everywhere with zero hesitations, since it just doesn't break. And even if I lost it - I can buy a new one without my bank account imploding. As someone who has the locksmith on speed dial, this is a relieving experience.     As for more formal occasions: While the AMPHIBIA goes well with a suit, there is a certain nonconformity in its simplicity. It is impossible to flash around. However, it radiates the quiet confidence of functionality and quality build. If I had to describe it, I'd say it is a lot like going to a suit and tie event, but being ripped underneath your shirt.   Bottomline:    I love it.   The VOSTOK AMPHIBIA is the watch for you if...   ... are a no-nonsense-kind-of-guy.   ... value functionality over flash.   ... would like to have nice looking watch without breaking the bank.   ... like cool pieces of history.    ... value unique things.
text:Interesting... I'm not a watch guy, but this might be a good cheap upgrade from my cheap quartz.  How do you feel about the Limosine model?  Also... how do you buy these things?  Edit: Oh, is this a totally different company?	labels:	episode_done:True

Pants offer such variety interesting textures that are immediately noticeable since they touch your skin directly, where as tops I'm usually wearing a t-shirt under them.

text:People who work in the fashion industry - what do you wear?	labels:I live in Los Angeles and I work at a mid -sized fashion wholesale company in sales (a little bit of production and design). I wear a lot of streetwear, casual but clean. Sometimes if I'm feeling lazy it will be sneakers with joggers and a crop top (crop tops may not be appropriate at everyone's workplace), other times it may be an oversized hoodie and biker shorts. On meeting days I may wear something more stylish like black wide leg slacks, leotard cotton span top and a cardigan.      I would say it largely depends on the type of company you work for, but you would probably be safe with nice blouse and jeans or even leggings and a oversized tunic or shirt. The industry  is pretty forgiving because fashion is all about expressing yourself so have fun and be comfortable!

text:MFA's Own: 2020 Favorites	labels:Hi all,   With the wrap up of 2020, I decided to ask members of MFA to submit their favorite fits of which they‚Äôve posted throughout the year. The range of styles and silhouettes presented here serves as a great reminder of the truly amazing variety we see in this community.   So c‚Äômon, have a scroll through the album! Maybe not all the fits are your cup of tea, but they don‚Äôt have to be! Before you type out ‚Äúwhy would someone even wear that,‚Äù just think maybe they like the way they look. Seeing as this is a collection of the users‚Äô favorite fits from the year, I‚Äôd wager they really like the way they look. And, at the end of the day, if you feel good, you look good.   See y‚Äôall in 2021.

text:How do you style your existing wardrobe in a way that doesn‚Äôt get boring?	labels:One trick I tried was to make a sort of rule for the day. My favorite was to dress monochrome so going through my closet to find clothes of the same variation of color would create some fun variations/interesting mixes of styles. Another was pattern mixing....that sort of thing.
text:This works! I‚Äôm the type of person who loves an item, stocks up on similar items, but then really just keeps wearing the original on repeat.

text:2020 Gift Megathread	labels:Hello! I'm a teen so I have a budget of about $50 max but I really want to get my mom something year. I'm kind of stumped since whatever she really wants she just buys (she just bought a bunch of plates from lenox on Black Friday). She's super into cooking and baking (and has a bunch of pots/pans already) and she dresses pretty classy (last place she bought from was Tahari.) Any suggestions?
text:You could get her a nice [banaton basket](https://www.williams-sonoma.com/products/brotform-proofing-basket-round-loaf/). I have several and they're amazing for baking.   I love Williams Sonoma/SLT/Crate & Barrel for under $50 cooking gifts.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 02, 2021	labels:I‚Äôve had a pair of Iron Rangers for a couple years now and I honestly can‚Äôt tell still if they fit well or if they‚Äôre too big.  My sneaker size is 12, and my size in 1000 Miles is 10.5. My Iron Rangers are size 11, because that‚Äôs all that was available when they were on sale.   They‚Äôre not uncomfortable or anything, they‚Äôre just slightly awkward to walk in, more than I can remember the Wolverines being, though I haven‚Äôt had those in years. I can‚Äôt tell if they‚Äôre too big, if there‚Äôs too much room around my heel, or if I just focus on it a lot when I wear them.
text:They shouldn‚Äôt be awkward to walk in.  It sounds like you bought a size hoping it would work because they were on sale.  I understand that mindset but it‚Äôs time to try a size 10 and 10.5 to see if they feel better.  If they feel better then sell the 11s and eat the loss. If they don‚Äôt feel better then maybe IRs just aren‚Äôt for you ‚Äî so sell the 11s and eat the loss.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- November 06	labels:[deleted]
text:Might not be the answer you want, but I think you're overthinking this. The shirts look fine to me, though you may be right that they're too loose around the waist and I would credit this to the cut of the pants. Try the shirts again with something looser below and re-evaluate - I'm willing to bet it'll come together better. As it stands your shoulders make you look top heavy.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Difficulty distinguishing between so 'idealized' style and personal style?	labels:I feel you! For me, it's less about laziness and more just a sense of my style doesn't really fit into the casual world that we live in a lot of the time. I love Blair Waldorf too! If you feel like there's that element of insecurity to it I would suggest just going for it. My friend and I dressed up as her for Halloween and tried to recreate those "Spotted" photos ([a photo of my attempt if you're curious how it turned out](https://www.thebrunetteprep.com/post/blair-waldorf-halloween-costume)) and honestly we did feel ridiculous the whole time, but we were also having the time of our life.  So maybe make a challenge for yourself? And just like do the model off duty outfits for a week and the ultra-feminine romantic the next. No missing days and it doesn't matter where you're going. You already have a lot of the clothes! So once you get through the weeks you should have an idea of what you feel the most confident in and maybe that will help give you some more direction.  Keep in mind, it also could take getting used to because if every time you make the switch it's directly from loungewear to an aesthetic you just might not be used to how you look. So think of it as a haircut that has to grow on you. I hope that helps somewhat! :)	episode_done:True
text:Brands that no longer live up to their name or quality	labels:This comes up here a lot, but many of the outdoors brands have turned into mostly fashion brands, and the quality has dropped as a result. The North Face, with the exception of a few of their collections (e.g. Summit); Columbia, and Mountain Hardware which they bought; and Marmot are some of the more famous examples.  Patagonia, Arc'teryx, Outdoor Reaearch, Fjallraven, and Kuhl are currently good alternatives, but I like to check the ultralight / camping subreddits for the most up to date info.	episode_done:True
text:What's your favorite kind of novelty clothing?	labels:I do (in the Before Times anyway) roller derby. My crazy sock collection fills an entire laundry basket. Super heroes, constellations, dinosaurs, Nightmare Before Xmas, space invaders, star wars, star trek...I have to restrain myself from buying new socks almost daily. I honestly took socks out of my Amazon cart less than an hour ago.
text:Are we speaking crew socks or knee high socks here?  Because I LOVE novelty socks and might need some longer ones!	labels:Yes.  My knee sox outnumber my crew sox by about 2:1. I get most of my knee sox from either Sock It To Me, Sock Dreams, or by checking the clearance section at Bruised Boutique or Wicked Skatewear.   Both knee high and crew sox i normally find at Ocean State Job Lot, Marshall's, Jo-Ann's, Spencer's, Spirit Halloween, Hot Topic, etc.  I go for the clearance section almost exclusively, and yet, i still own probably 100 pairs of sox.	episode_done:True
text:Dressing Drakes on a Budget	labels:Also worth noting that Drake's can often be had far below retail if you keep an eye open.  I have two sport coats I got for ~$250 each on the Bay.   Drake's does an "archive" sale of past season stuff periodically, too. I picked up a shirt jacket for half-off last time.	episode_done:True

How do you style it ?	labels:I have caret (like wine colored), camel, and I did want to buy like this pair of teal green pants but they rant out of my size before I got to buy :( usually I pair with solid colored neutral tops to emphasize the uniqueness of the color, or if I will wear with patterned tops then usually there's a color on the pattern that will echo the color of my trousers. Also, pair contrasting colors, like those opposite the colorwheel. Yellow pants might go well with greys, lilacs, cobalt blue or purple clothing. Anything bright colored usually pairs well with some sort of black and white stripe pattern. Orange and dark/navy blue pair well together.	episode_done:True

text:No (New) Jawnz January: 2021 Edition	labels:When I'm really hyped up over a new garment I just found online, I ask myself this armor-piercing question: *Do I already own this?*  It forces me to shift gears out of hype mode and take a mental stock of my wardrobe. While I may not own an exact copy of the garment I'm considering buying, I probably own a piece that fulfills the same purpose already (with regards to utility or aesthetics), and if the comparison is too close with the new item then I know I should wait a week and see if I still feel the same attraction to it. In most cases this allows the glamour of novelty to fade, and I've saved myself money and a potential redundancy in my closet. It's helped me a lot over the years.	episode_done:True

text:Does anyone else use a ‚Äúformula‚Äù to create their outfits?	labels:I used to follow a lot of formulas and guidelines, but as I documented my outfits (and started seeing other people document theirs), I found that [listening to my lizard overlord](https://www.instagram.com/p/CIlhWoCFiWx/) made me a lot happier. Here are some things my lizard overlord likes for now. I'm sure this will change:  * Comfort first - nothing itchy, restrictive, or painful. This is my most important "rule". * Colors/patterns - I love combining different colors and/or patterns, but they need to have something in common in order for me to like them together, e.g. both patterns have a similar color or the colors are a similar shade. I have always hated wearing pastels/neons and tend to prefer jewel tones or earth tones (although I don't usually like mixing them together). * Statement pieces - I tend to prefer minimalist or maximalist combinations although I can't dress quite as maximalist as I would like due to the limitations of my wardrobe. * Silhouette - I tend to like all pieces form fitting or all relaxed. I have a weird hang up when it comes to skinny jeans w/ oversized tops but am perfectly fine w/ the combo of straight leg jeans with an oversized top or a form fitting top w/ skinny jeans. * Feminine/masculine - I like feminine elements to outfits but tend to combine them with something more gender neutral. For example, if I wear a white dress with lace on it, I'll pair it with black combat boots.  EDIT: Thanks for all the love, but I am not u/FriskyGatos \- just a huge fan. I guess my post wasn't clear in that I was citing her ideas rather than posting my own IG.

text:How much was your most expensive fashion item and when or how often do you wear it?	labels:The most expensive item I owned was a $300 pair of shoes that I didn't have a choice but to buy (MOH at my sister's wedding, she required matchy matchy $300 shoes).  I wore them for all of 15 minutes (they gave me blisters) before changing to flats for the reception.  They were 4 inch stilettos that I could barely walk in (and outdoor wedding).  I have since decluttered them.
text:I feel like if you are going to demand others wear $300 uncomfortable shoes for the sake of your own wedding aesthetics, the least you can do is buy it for them.	labels:Yeah last wedding I was in the bride just asked for heels about three inches (she knew we would all be ok wearing them/normally wear higher), black, and round toe.

text:"Can people just hate fashion again" - Synecdoche When Talking about the "Industry" Discussion	labels:> Should spaces & industries for fashion lovers, clothes lovers, and people that have to wear clothes be completely separate?  I don‚Äôt think that any of these groups should be completely separate however I do find them all being lumped into the same spaces very frustrating as someone who does love fashion as a form of art and creativity.  I like harsh and blunt constructive criticism in pretty much all areas of life and I most certainly want it for my outfits as well. I want to hear what other fashion lovers and artists think of my colour choices, proportions, textures, fit, etc. and be able to refine those things and really flex my creative muscles when creating an outfit. Instead, many fashion spaces are dominated by ‚Äòyou do you hun!‚Äô and ‚Äòso long as you like it, that‚Äôs all that matters!‚Äô which is great for someone *who has to wear clothes* and doesn‚Äôt actually care about fashion but joins fashion spaces because they feel some obligation as a woman to care about it but... those spaces just become unhelpful and bland for those who really love fashion and want to get better at it.  I‚Äôve been an off and on follower of FFA for a few years and I feel like it‚Äôs definitely dominated by the ‚Äúpeople who wear clothes‚Äù group and unfortunately it limits the amount of critique that is acceptable to give.

I agree, I think this sub is made up of people who enjoy looking at clothes or just want to know how to dress appropriately for work & school. There's a few subjects *related* to the industry as a whole that people are passionate about, like sustainability & ethics, but I don't think this sub is able to appreciate fashion as a form of art.   I agree that a *you do you* isn't very helpful. If someone specifically asks for constructive criticism, they want feedback from people with an eye for detail. If it looks like their blazer or pants need to be tailored a bit, then let them know if they're seeking constructive criticism.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:I actually really like the Czech and Polish rain capes. They look like a cross between a cloak and a trench coat.   I said it elsewhere, but I really wish I lived somewhere cold enough to warrant a shawl. My wife has this nice wool shawl that looks great on both of us, but it's never cool enough to wear it.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Cold weather friendly skirts and dresses	labels:I also hate wearing pants. Don‚Äôt know how cold we‚Äôre talking but up to around  40 F, I would pretty much wear any autumn-y skirt/dress and rely on my wool tights, knee high leather boots, and a long wool coat to provide warmth for my lower body. Personally, most of the skirts I chose to wear were 100% cotton denim, leather, or suede!
text:I like a mid-calf wool skirt that has plenty of folds, a wide hem, and a satin lining. The shape allows freedom of movement and room for other layers, and the smooth lining defeats friction so the hem doesn‚Äôt bunch up.   In the depth of winter, I‚Äôll wear silk long johns and Cuddle-Duds pants underneath; the Duds are easy to pull off without putting on a show when I get to my desk. (I dislike changing in a bathroom.)  Lately I‚Äôve had the thought that the ideal under layer might be those Indian-style pants with the crotch that comes down to the knee.	labels:Anyone know where to buy silk long johns in Canada?	episode_done:True

text:(Man) Repeller: A postmortem	labels:lmao maybe i don't have an artistic eye for fashion, but i looked at the insta that archives old man repeller outfits (@oldmanrepeller) and i don't get what makes any of those outfits "fashion" rather than "i picked it blindfolded out of my giant jumbled rich person walk in closet". It all looks so random to me, and I guess the point isn't to be appealing  (hence "repeller"), but I genuinely can't make sense of where creativity/sense of style/proportion/tailoring/colour matching comes into play. All the outfits look like a weird jumble calculated to pop in a sea of social media algorithms, not necessarily good, but different enough to catch the eye. Am I...crazy for thinking this? Is this basically what "style" is in the age of instagram?
text:You're not alone. I felt this way when I read *The Cool Factor*. Apparently "cool" means mixing and matching things that - in my opinion - have no business being matched. No judgement, but it's not for me.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What age do you think you're too old to follow teenage-type style trends (ie e-girl style etc)? Or are you ever, why/why not?	labels:23 is young  And despite being archaic per Reddit's standards, I don't feel like i'm too old to wear any particular style. If I did feel old I would probably tap into my creative side and find a way to incorporate the style to my comfort level.
text:Agreed. I‚Äôm 31 and I LOVE some of the current trends out there. I just style it a bit differently to fit the needs of my job/life and comfort level. I might focus on colour and material over cut, or get the cut in a less overt colour.   There‚Äôs only so much longer I can maintain abs.

text:General Discussion - December 13, 2020	labels:I hope nobody takes this comment as me being an asshole, because I‚Äôm intending this to be more of a constructive criticism than that.  But honestly, as someone whose style kind of stagnated somewhere in the mid 2010s, I kind of feel like this sub isn‚Äôt very helpful for updating my style, because the sub also refuses to catch up with what‚Äôs fashionable.  Like streetwear has obviously captured the zeitgeist for quite a while now. That‚Äôs always been an element of my wardrobe. But I feel like I could do better to expand my style and have more options and just in general better embrace trends and incorporate them into my own personal style.  But for the most part this sub isn‚Äôt really interested in keeping up. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm not expecting this sub to start going crazy for box logos or Supreme or dress like a futuristic cartoon character, if I was interested in that I would actually just read r/streetwear. But I do wish some of the recurring threads and users could offer some inspo in terms of tasteful, grown up streetwear outfits and things like that. But from my perception, MFA is still stuck in early 2010s menswear, J. Crew inspired Americana, or just outright standard business casual. Which is *fine*, it doesn‚Äôt look bad, but it‚Äôs certainly not fashionable anymore and despite that the default male fashion sub won‚Äôt look beyond it, largely.  EDIT: People have been asking me for examples, here‚Äôs some stuff that I‚Äôve liked lately, I don‚Äôt know that most or any of this is what you‚Äôd call ‚Äústreetwear‚Äù but it‚Äôs more in the direction of what I‚Äôm talking about   Thom Yorke is one of my consistently favorite style inspo sources, he pulls off a pretty good hybrid of tasteful streetwear and classic menswear style I think.  I like this kind of fit he‚Äôs worn a lot of the last couple years:   (Actually can‚Äôt find the exact pic I‚Äôm looking for here so I‚Äôll try my best here)  https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/theoaklandpress.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/1/4b/14bc5350-f6ff-11e8-8bd7-83eb124e2f8a/5c052f56b8ad2.image.jpg?resize=1200%2C800  Usually coupled with one of these Undercover jackets like this:  https://static.stereogum.com/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1161546807-1570042584-compressed.jpg  I think one of the pieces he wears a lot are the Acne Ryder pants, which I kind of like as hybrid classic menswear combined with a more informal, streetwear adjacent vibe:  https://www.nordstrom.com/s/acne-studios-ryder-slim-fit-pants/5146319  I also like Acne in general and I wish I could afford some of these jeans to work into some outfits I have kicking around in my head:  https://www.acnestudios.com/us/en/max-blue-black/B00146-AIL.html?categid=man-jeans  I also like Daniel Lopatin aka Oneohtrix Point Never‚Äôs style as well, who I‚Äôd say does kind of a more tasteful streetwear thing as well. This press pic is a nice example:  https://dazedimg-dazedgroup.netdna-ssl.com/1400/azure/dazed-prod/1230/9/1239834.jpg  More OPN with bonus Safdie brother: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DOn1aXWWsAAeZSC.jpg  I also like these black denim jackets, chore jackets kind of thing. I have a good Rag & Bone one that I‚Äôve gained too much weight to wear, but these 3sixteen and Rogue Territory ones are nice too and along those lines:  https://www.3sixteen.com/collections/outerwear/products/type-3s-denim-jacket-lightweight-double-black   https://www.rogueterritory.com/collections/jackets/products/supply-jacket-stealth-black?variant=5415637057568  Also along these lines, this Carhartt WIP jacket: https://stagprovisions.com/collections/carhartt-wip/products/carhartt-wip-modular-jacket-ss18  In general I like the use of black/muted or monochromatic colors, I like the idea of drawing influence from punk/hardcore style because I‚Äôm into that as well, but I haven‚Äôt figured out exactly how to make that work. Also for that reason, I‚Äôd like to replace my Red Wings with a pair of Docs, I like the rougher around the edges style better.  I‚Äôm gonna trying to keep editing this post, Reddit is kinda fucking up on my phone.

text:What did people *actually* wear in 2000's?	labels:I think whats popular now is more late 90s and Y2k as opposed to like 2005. I'm currently watching the Real Housewives of Orange County and the style is basically extremely low rise flare jeans, layered camis, empire waist flowy blouses with giant cross necklaces, and halter tops. It's giving me traumatic flashbacks of middle school. I do have to say I kind of like the blonde hair on the outside black on the inside style.
text:I was going to say this too. The pale pastel/white fitted and cropped baby-rib twin sets (consisting of a cami or a "girly" t-shirt with a matching fitted cardigan that had a single closure) with the lettuce edge hems and a dainty graphic in the middle (of like an angel, a flower, or a butterfly) are very much like what I wore as a preteen in 1997-1999, with midrise flares and \*those\* chunky Steve Madden slides. I remember the fabric weights, while fine and delicate, were more substantial than in the crepe-paper tops of the 00's. Rayon midi/maxi skirts in tiny watercolor-y florals were popular too. It seems like this era is what's popular with GenZ.  Early 2000s were more about bright, geometric prints (stripes, plaid or big flowers), and the cuts are all long long long (low-rise bootcuts that dragged on the floor, worn with pointy d'orsay kitten heels, and all the long cami/polo shirt (with a white collar) layering mentioned before. Skirts were like 13" long max, were worn low on the hips, and usually had a ruffle or flounce as the hem. Basically everything was to make you look as tall and skinny as possible.	labels:	episode_done:True

Before COVID and back in my hometown, I would order stuff to my house and then take pants to be tailored, or just got stuff in person at Uniqlo who tailor for you in the store. Since I moved to California, I didn't even had a chance to find a reasonably priced alterations tailor within a reasonable distance before COVID hit.

text:Tips for reducing impulse buying/careless spending?	labels:I was in this same position a few years ago! I highly recommend creating a budget and setting aside a certain amount of money each month for fashion/clothing/shopping etc. This prevents you from feeling guilty or restricted from shopping.   Also, I would recommend creating a wishlist of pieces you want to buy and planning out when you want to buy them. For example, in the beginning of the year, I knew I wanted a good pair of boots this year. So I wrote down in my wishlist on my phone that I would buy them in September/October. I think this helps to be more mindful when shopping as items will be on your list for a while so you have to think about and research them and how they will fit into your wardrobe before you actually buy them!	episode_done:True

text:If your wearing the same pair of shoes pretty much everyday it doesn‚Äôt really matter how expensive / high quality they are, they are going to wear out fast.  .  The simplest and best way to extend the life of any shoes is to wear them in rotation with other pairs and make sure they have time to fully dry/rest after you‚Äôve worn them. Things like shoe trees can also help them keep their shape and reduce creasing.  .  The greats are a solid shoe but whether you get them or something else, I‚Äôd recommend also getting something like a cheap pair of vans / Stan smiths to give the greats a rest at least a couple of times a week especially if it‚Äôs particularity bad weather.	labels:Picked up these to try to have a bit of rotation. I've been an everyday killshot wearer so not used to the more athletic style of these but they seemed cool: https://jonesbootmaker.us/products/tristan-leather-lace-up-trainer-tristan-318-120?variant=34598793412744  Do you have any recommendations otherwise besides Greats?	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 30, 2020	labels:I am thinking of a pair of Captoe Derby Boots.

Can these boots be worn with a navy blue suit?

text:What are your favorite, trusted clothing lines for buying wear-forever investment classics?	labels:Most things i get from Torrid hold up pretty darn well.  When i need a refresh of normal boring collared shirts, i turn to them first.  Though, my oldest 2 collared shirts are Avenue, but i don't know if they are as good as they were 10-ish years ago when i bought those 2 shirts.  For trousers that can survive work, 511 and Rothco are the best.  The stitching on Rothco is slightly more rugged, IMHO, but 511 is a smidge cheaper, so i will buy it if i find it with free shipping.  For really really really gorgeous clothes that are too fancy for work that so far (N = 3) appear indestructible, Verillas.  I wish i could build my entire wardrobe out of them, everything is just so gorgeous, but priced accordingly.	episode_done:True

I wouldn't take the hat off if I was shopping, at a gallery, museum, or in a bar, but if I sat down at a restaurant I would. Basically if I'm staying put for a longer period of time I'd take the hat off same as how I would take my coat off. But again it depends on the coat/hat.  Honestly the old rules about taking your hat off in certain situations are gone, the only place where it still feels natural to take a hat off is if I'm sitting down at a restaurant to eat, but even that doesn't really matter.
text:I‚Äôve long hair so I feel like my hair needs to be styled to look right under the hat if that makes sense.   I do wear berets but I‚Äôm not totally comfortable in them. I guess the more I wear them the more comfortable I‚Äôll get.	labels:IMO much of hat wearing (or getting used to any new look) is down to just wearing it consistently and getting used to seeing yourself in it.	episode_done:True

I‚Äôve been told I look like a little boy when I wear tight clothes and that really stuck with me. I always felt undeserving of wearing tight/sexy clothes and sometimes I still do because I don‚Äôt look like a fashion nova model. On Instagram if I see a girl like me wearing tight clothes it‚Äôs usually filled with men saying ‚Äúshe has no ass.‚Äù ‚ÄúShe looks like a kid.‚Äù As ive gotten older I‚Äôve gotten a more fuck it attitude and wear a lot of tight dresses that I like and think I look good in regardless of what other people might think.   I understand that I‚Äôm skinny and I def don‚Äôt have the same experiences as other people who are bigger than me but even those small offhand comments really altered how I viewed my body.

I would get rid of things that you could easily replace and polyester/polyamide (because it‚Äôs not as breathable and caused me bacne).   For the third piece, consider accessories.

Wide fits (to make room for the gut) with horrendous colors and weird rand;mized texts. Despite how crappy and haphazardly designed it all looks, it's somehow got a "boujie" status too.   To make it even harder to understand, their brand ambassador is one of the [singers](https://www.campdavid-soccx.de/Herren/Bekleidung/Jacken-Westen/Daunenjacke-mit-Kapuze-im-Racing-Stil-pale-white.html) from Modern Talking, and no this doesn't seem to harm their sales at all.

Have been working in menswear for the entirety of my working years, so almost a decade in the business now.   While its not exciting -- I started at Brooks Brothers. This was years ago, when the brand stood for something. I got to work along some hardcore industry vets who took me under their wing.   Then over the years I have gotten to work at just about every "type" of menswear shop. Big box retailers, flashy online-only outfits, bottom of the barrel makers, the extreme top of the top family owned shops.   I've been able to do everything within the business, too. I've sold, designed collections, marketed, ran operations, did the buying, taken out the trash, taped up and shipped orders. The whole thing.	episode_done:True
text:How many clothes do you have? (Really?)	labels:I think the size of your wardrobe is going to depend on your climate, job, hobbies, and general lifestyle. I have a lot more clothing than that. I also live in a place with four seasons. I have outdoorsy hobbies that require some tougher clothes. I can‚Äòt wear my casual clothing to work (and I‚Äôm also holding onto some more professional clothing from a past job in case I return to that field). I don‚Äôt have a lot of disposable income either, so I always keep things like dress pants even though I never wear them in my everyday, because I can‚Äôt afford to go shopping when interviews and funerals come up.  For instance, I probably have at least 15 dresses alone, once you count all the strappy sundresses, nice work dresses, wool sweater dresses, the cocktail dresses, and the evening gown that‚Äôs in the back of my closet - and everything in between.  I swap out my clothing with the seasons and have one closet that I share with my husband, so I try to be judicious about what I keep, while giving myself grace that I don‚Äôt need to get rid of something just because I don‚Äôt wear it regularly.

I think that makes a better shape than my slightly long, boxier one.  I've been on the look out for an EG vest this fall, if anyone has any other recs, i'd love to hear. I may hunt through some vintage stores for an old woolrich puffer vest cause i love those.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 16, 2021	labels:What are your thoughts on dress shoes that are spit-shined? As in, the type where you see your reflection in 'em  I usually just polish dress shoes with a single layer of wax or two so it's protected from scuffs. But aiming for a mirror look seems like an interesting skill
text:It looks great when executed properly but it takes a bit of practice to get right. It‚Äôs a time and labor-intensive process for which there aren‚Äôt any shortcuts.  I typically only do it for special occasions or when I‚Äôm stressed out and need to practice shoe maintenance meditation.   Remember to only apply the mirror shine to areas that don‚Äôt bend (toe cap and heel counters). Applying it elsewhere will likely lead to cracking or flaking.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What is one item that you own too much of?	labels:Shoes in general. And yet I keep buying them. At least I wear them though.  I would also say sweaters. I don't own a ton but I went through a period where I picked up a lot and I really don't wear them ever. They're good to have in a pinch I guess but my style has shifted away from in office wear so I would rather just wear a hoodie these days.	episode_done:True
text:If you had $5,000 to What-Not-To-Wear style re-do your whole wardrobe, how would you do it? What would be your process? What would you prioritize?	labels:I would get a full set of mid range, good quality but not too expensive essentials, and spend roughly 400 on that. That would cover all the basics like undies, socks, tees, jeans, leggings, dresses, jammies, etc. I would then spend roughly 600 on some decent work clothes and formal wear that is well tailored. Because I'd be wearing these every day, I probably wouldn't want to spend any more than this for fear that they would need replacing or fixing after wear and tear that I then wouldn't be able to afford. I would spend about 1000 on any fancy clothes that I just like or want that I know will last, and 1000 on several pairs of expensive, good quality shoes for various different occasions. I would spend 1000 on some outerwear- maybe a formal coat, a heavy duty waterproof/windproof/thermal, a fancy one, and several seasonal/occasional jackets. The remaining money (1000) would probably go towards accessories- bags, belts, scarves, hats, jewellery, and in particular a fairly expensive watch that will last forever (or at least a long time). I think I like the idea of a capsule wardrobe, but in reality I am too body conscious, too eclectic in taste, and too focused on comfort to have minimal clothing. I would probably aim to buy fewer items but with better quality, aim go for several interchangeable 'looks' that can be altered through mixing and matching items.  Either that, or I would replace my entire wardrobe with a series of beautifully fitting, comfortable pyjamas to suit every need.	episode_done:True

text:I‚Äôm not able to read the notes  I think the big thing that stands out to me is that it‚Äôs a little incongruous stylistically, you‚Äôre using a bunch of basic bastard workwear footwear and bottoms combined with more streetwear heavy tops and athleisure sneakers thrown in every now and then and it just feels...a bit off?  There‚Äôs some really good fits in there when everything lines up together well but it could use a bit more focus.  [this](https://i.imgur.com/aUYWzJP_d.jpg?maxwidth=640&shape=thumb&fidelity=medium) for instance works well into you get to the weird neutral blob sneakers(I‚Äôm super biased against UB/350s/roshe wave of sneakers fwiw), it‚Äôd be better with either minimal leather sneakers or like dunks or jordan 1s or something.  [this](https://i.imgur.com/cbTMjVj_d.jpg?maxwidth=640&shape=thumb&fidelity=medium) is a super solid BB fit, it‚Äôs consistent thematically and all the pieces go well with each other, same with [this](https://i.imgur.com/bnUyUqE_d.jpg?maxwidth=640&shape=thumb&fidelity=medium) one(my personal fave, really love how the jacket sits on you), everything after this one is not good imo.  You‚Äôre in the experimental phase rn, I‚Äôd say overall you have a really good eye for color coordination, it seems like you just need work out honing in what you‚Äôre going for thematically, and upgrade some pieces.   As minor nitpics, I think about half of your tops are maybe a size or so too large, most of the long sleeve tees in particular look too big, you could fix it by just push cuffs over your wrist instead of letting it hang down as a temp fix, I think upgrading footwear is the big thing here, we have tons of recs already but I‚Äôd say given the minor streetwear lean you have here something like a pair of dunks or airforces would probably serve you well, I hate quarterzips  Edit: I‚Äôd also all of your pants could be wider, it‚Äôd balance pit proportions and I think the mild stacking you have would look better with the pant legs fully covering the shoes instead of hanging onto the tongue	labels:Thank you so much this is exactly what I was looking for and helpful beyond measurement.

text:What was your "how in the name of all that is holy did this end up in a thrift store" find?	labels:Not me, but in high school my best friend at the time found a legitimate vintage Chanel bag with a broken clasp. It was dusty, and in otherwise perfect condition aside from the clasp, no tears or scuffs. We figured it was probably a knockoff but it was cute so she took it somewhere to get repaired and seen as to whether it was real or not. Turns out it was from the 50s, an original run of the iconic 2.55 handbag. We were amazed.   She could have sold it for a nice chunk of change, but she kept it because it was such an amazing find. Only $3 too. I still can't believe it was just chilling on a shelf at a run down Value World for so long, and they didn't even realize what it was worth.

What‚Äôs really helped me is Pinterest tbh. I enjoy curating the different boards, especially my clothing one. I usually go through my home page just saving outfits I think look cute, the specific aesthetics don‚Äôt matter to me it‚Äôs just what‚Äôs cute, and then I can look through my whole board and notice specific things I like. I‚Äôve realized the cuts, colors, and types of clothing I prefer through this process.  I also find that most larger retail websites have a ‚Äòfind my size‚Äô option, where you can input info about yourself and your clothing that fits best.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 18, 2020	labels:Just got [these Elevnty drawstring trousers](https://i.imgur.com/H4W6BtJ.jpg) from the Rack clearance.   Honestly, I bought them on a whim cause I thought it seemed interesting and I've been trying to incorporate some stuff in my wardrobe that's unusual (for me at least).   But now that I have them, I don't really know what to do with them. How would you style them? What would you wear with them? Looking for both tops and shoes recommendations that would go with something like this.   Also, they're waaay too long on me. Looking at the hem (and having a little understanding of formal trousers), I think the idea is that you're supposed to have them brought up no matter what. Is that the idea? Or am I supposed to just roll up the cuffs? Really not sure what to do there. For reference, I'm like a 29 or 30 length in pants and I think these are like 36.5.

text:Do you feel constrained fashion-wise by not wanting to (or being able to) wear heels?	labels:This is an interesting take for me, as I feel constrained by my circumstances to not wear heels but in a different manner. I am 6'1" at 20 years old, and I always feel self conscious wearing heels as I tower over some men and women. It elicits unwanted comments of "wow, you are so tall!! I would never want to be that height" and it makes me insecure sometimes.  This is especially true in male-dominated spaces. I generally feel as though my height requires me to make (some) men feel at ease so they are not overly intimidated by me and instead will take me and my ideas seriously. Therefore, adding heels to my already tall frame exacerbates the problem.  I'm trying to work through these feelings of perception and insecurity because I absolutely love styling heels!

text:General Discussion - December 13, 2020	labels:Weekend recap:  Seattle lost. That makes me happy.  Oregon State also lost. That makes me sad.  Also, an indictment of the state of sports this year: while watching the Oregon State-Stanford game, ESPN's ticker updated after USC's win over UCLA, noting that USC would meet Washington in the Pac-12 title game. It also informed that, if USC were to be ineligible due to COVID-19, Colorado would represent the South, and if Washington were ineligible, Oregon would represent the North. It's all academic now, with Oregon State's loss, but if they'd beaten Stanford, the Beavers would have improved to 3-3 (3-2 division), versus Oregon's 3-2 (2-2 divison, with a head-to-head loss to Oregon State). Yet, Oregon was already anointed as the second-in-succession to the North's crown. Lame. Or has ESPN just gone retarded?  Also, 5-0 Ohio State needs special dispensation to play in the Big Ten championship (which should be made), and are considered a likely lock for a playoff spot. 5-0 USC? Not even a second glance. I'm curious to see how it'll all fall out if USC wins, and Ohio State loses, however unlikely that is to happen.  Final thought: the CFP committee completely screwed the pooch by not going to a six-team format. Or even eight. This was the perfect year for it.	episode_done:True

text:Can you have a clothing style without actually wearing that certain style much?	labels:This isn‚Äôt a direct answer to your question, but I‚Äôve found I have a ‚Äòhopeful‚Äô sense of style and a ‚Äòrealistic‚Äô sense of style.  Hopeful-me will think about buying a teal floral wrap dress because it‚Äôs gorgeous. Realistic-me knows it will sit in my closet untouched for 3 years because I don‚Äôt wear teal!   I‚Äôve learned to differentiate between the two while I shop, at least. If I was a celebrity suddenly, maybe I would lean towards hopeful-me‚Äôs style, but for now I am normal and realistic!
text:Yes, I agree, I think OP has this "hopeful me" style and a "realistic me" style to please her family. I think OP can sprinkle a little bit of her alternative style with her casual everyday wear. For example, wear your regular t-shirt and jeans but add a cool black leather jacket. You can never go wrong with a piece like that and it's not too offensive.  Or, you can dress to satisfy your family but wear a darker color up top. Or add cool spike earrings.   I think you can combine the two styles so that you can satisfy your family and call your style "alternative".	labels:In a related sense, I've sometimes found that I can find a slightly different "style" that gives the same effect on my body. It won't be the exact same clothes/colors/cuts that I see posted elsewhere or on models, but choose something that, on the hanger, doesn't necessarily give the same impression and it will turn out that, on my body, it will give a similar effect because of drape or how the colors look on me. So I can sometimes find a way to have the same aesthetic even though the "original" version of the styles don't look/fit right.	episode_done:True

text:Let's talk the impact of fragrance on perception of style! How much does a person's fragrance affect your impression of them? Do you choose perfume with this in mind? What are some of your favourites?	labels:I'm very sensitive to smell, so people's fragrance decisions make a strong impression. There are a few really awful ones out there‚ÄîMugler Angel is one of the few that will give me a migraine if overapplied‚Äîbut in general perfume is preferable to body odor. (I've had to give up my spot in a long grocery line or get off the subway a few stops early because someone's B.O. or feet made me nauseous.) Men's cologne can give off a "douchebag" vibe, but for me that's useful information rather than headache fuel. And some women's scents are a bit cloying‚Äîvery sweet, dessert-inspired perfumes strike me as juvenile or try-hard, and I don't usually click with people who wear them. A softer, more sophisticated scent (on any gender) is usually a sign that I'll get along with someone.   It's nice when a scent aligns with someone's personal style, but a clash can be charming, too. I recently met someone who was wearing a lovely and subtle fig-based scent, but paired with edgy, Gen-Z style clothing (faux fur, checkerboard print, stompy boots, etc). Somehow it just worked.   Personally, I choose a scent based on mood, season and the day's activities. That influences my outfit too, but they aren't directly linked. In general I like "green" or woody scents year round. Seasonally, I add spice in the autumn, vetiver or leather in winter, iris or white flowers for spring, and citrus, tea or jasmine in the summer. I also have scents that get me in the mood for certain activities‚ÄîBerdoues Selva do Brazil is a favourite for writing/editing, and Chanel Chance Eau Fra√Æche makes me feel confident in opera auditions. These are lighter, fresher scents that can be applied discreetly, so they're great for professional wear. I wear Guerlain V√©tiver for the holidays, and Chanel 19 for formal daytime activities. Ralph Lauren Woman, Frederic Malle Parfum de Th√©r√®se, or Prada Infusion d'Iris are nice evening options. I'm still looking for a citrus scent that actually lasts, for summer.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 17, 2020	labels:Thoughts on whether slim-fit navy chinos overlap too much with dark non-distressed jeans in a similar fit, for casual wear? I picked up the chinos from UNIQLO because they were on sale and fit well, but honestly I don't see myself reaching for them over my dark denim for casual war. For business casual and above (i.e., wearing a tucked-in button down shirt), I already have trousers/slacks in similar colors that I would wear instead of the chinos, so maybe they are a solution without a problem.

text:What will be obsolete by summer 2021?	labels:I‚Äôm hoping that narrow trends and strict ideas of what‚Äôs in and out become obsolete. The pandemic has everyone following their own rules, and I think we‚Äôre realizing what we individually gravitate to and prefer when we‚Äôre not trying to cater to society or fit in. Maybe people will rebel against ‚Äúx item is dated, y item is in, z is the hot trend‚Äù and say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt give a s**t what you think, and I‚Äôll wear what I like.‚Äù Maybe there will be greater acceptance of individual personal styles that may not have a lot in common with what‚Äôs in style right now. Instead of saying ‚Äúhmm that outfit? Really?‚Äù people will say ‚ÄúI see you, you‚Äôre valid, you‚Äôre rocking it, keep on doing you‚Äù

I usually wear a pair of black sneakers so a pair of really baggy jeans would just look wierd I feel so that's why I'm here asking for advice, thanks!
text:It sounds like you are wearing a relaxed tapered for aggressively tapered fit.  Try a slim-straight, straight fit or a mild tapered fit.  For example in Levis this would be 513, 501 & 502 respectively	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How has the quality changed over the years at some of your fav brands?	labels:Not really what I would consider a brand but...Target actually puts out clothing I want to wear now, in comfortable fabrics where 5-10 years ago I wouldn‚Äôt be caught dead in target clothing. Particularly their a new day line, which is just a madewell dupe let‚Äôs be honest. I find it extremely difficult not to pick up a new pair of extremely comfortable pajamas or a cute shirt every time I go to target for a grocery run.  It‚Äôs refreshing because Nowadays it‚Äôs like every piece of clothing at the mall is made of cheap polyester in unflattering cuts but you can still find cute stuff at target shopping in person.
text:Hmmm. I have been a Target clothing fan since the 90s lol. Even as my income and pickiness increase, a good chunk of my wardrobe is Target.    I had to cut down on Target runs because I would always find something cute! (I had a period where I would go a few times a week to kill time. I had a really annoying commute then where the traffic could be ridiculous. It was better to kill 30-60minutes at Target, and I would still get home at the same time vs just waiting in the traffic and feeling anxious and stressed).   While the fabrics on Who What Wear is hit or miss, I like the trendiness. I like Prologue‚Äôs take on minimalism. And the athleticwear at Target is great and holds up nicely.  I have the best athletic tops from Target.   Merona clothing was legit. The cardigans held up better than the same era of Banana Republic.  I still have some layering tanks - they easily lasted 7-10 years with no special treatment or care.  I finally got rid of my 15 year old Target Corduroy coat. I was kind of sick of it, and I no longer like double breasted items, but obviously it held up fine. The only issue was I had to restitch the buttons once in a while. And it was machine wash. I hope someone is getting great use out of it after I donated it.	labels:Yeah I'm in the same camp - I've always loved Target's clothes. I do think the quality has gone up lately which makes me happy, but the price tag has as well. It makes me think twice about buying a whole new wardrobe everytime I shop there.... probably a good thing tbh.	episode_done:True

Why do people who spend their time lurking this sub, silently absorbing whatever opinions and discussion, decide to come out of the woodwork to post _this_ hot take?

(this question goes towards if pants/jeans that fit you in the butt and thighs have a wide gap at the waist)   Are your legs "too long" for normal-sized bottoms? (regarding if you need tall sizes for jeans)   With your chest and shoulders, do you often have the issue that you need to size up to have correct shoulder hems but then the clothing item will be too wide in the chest/belly area?  Once you answer, I can give you some suggestions.

text:Does anyone have any visual guides for how clothes should fit	labels:#Just here to remind folks:  having a hard time finding clothes that fit you well is not indicative of your body being "wrong". Ready To Wear clothing is designed to fit well on one very specific type of body. **There is no problem with your body, the problem is the clothes.**  [Article: The Origin of Clothing Sizes](https://www.seamwork.com/issues/2016/01/the-origins-of-clothing-sizes)
text:> Ready To Wear clothing is designed to fit well on one very specific type of body.  I am going to add something to that : there is no "one specific type of body" which fits great every piece on the same size of ready made garments.... Models are models and even models can look like clothes they are being paid to model do not fit them right, even with tape and clips and tricks.   Each garment is a garment and cut in a certain way. Your body is a combination of many different measurements, most of which you might not even be aware of, things like your measurements UNDER your armpits, or where your waist is placed, or how long your arms or legs are. Each garment cut in a certain way will fit right specific individual bodies and fit wrong specific individual bodies. Not because one is not a "model" body type or whatever, but fashion decisions will affect it. It is as it is. Shopping means rejecting outright 90% of things which look interesting.  Anedocte: once in a  once favorite store of mine I was telling the SA admiringly "your tshirts are cut differently!". She - "everybody complains of the same! Why do they make the shoulders so narrow?". That was actually why i liked the tshirts, the size which fit my bust was not too wide on the shoulders for me!  Also, I have been practicing yoga for some years, in class, and my classes are usually very diverse (gender, ages). It is amazing how different bodies are at their proportions (you really notice the difference in arm or leg lengths), or things like shape of feet. And there is always always something very difficult for everybody else which is easy for you and vice-versa. Each body is different, it is how it is. There is NO one body type which is right for everything including all clothes fitting.	labels:Yes!! So many (if not almost all) fashion photoshoots have a seamstress *on set* to make alterations so that each garment looks perfect for each model! Such a good point, thank you for bringing that up.	episode_done:True
text:What are some stores/brands that have surprised you?	labels:Some of the tops and dresses I‚Äôve gotten the most compliments on at work have been from Eddie Bauer. When I get surprised comments about it being an ‚Äòoutdoor store‚Äô I usually respond with ‚Äòwell...I‚Äôm indoors now so...‚Äô Has been great for me.  Also Ecco for shoes. So comfy and they last with lots of use/ abuse.

The style changed a bit and I havent shopped there in a while but might have to go back.

text:What are some habits that keep clothes/shoes new vs that habits that ruin them?	labels:For me, it is in how you launder the item.  I wash all my laundry on cold with as little detergent as possible (I do pretreat stains).  I will use mesh bags very generously and wash darker items inside out.  I never use the dryer (I'm allergic to dryer sheets) and hang dry everything on a  drying rack (or hanging from door frames on a hanger.
text:Have you heard of dryer balls? Much better than dryer sheets & I assume you wouldn‚Äôt be allergic (they‚Äôre wool). But good for you for avoiding the dryer anyway!	labels:You can also use the dryer without sheets or balls. I just dry my clothes by themselves.	episode_done:True
text:Are there any actual fashion trends in 2020?	labels:There are fashion trends that can be found in what's being sold and sold out online, as well as instagram and tik tok that isn't just pajamas. Depending on what neighborhood you live in, you might see some folx embracing the following outside. (I live in a neighborhood of 20s to 30s years old in LA)  Vests, tennis skirts, tye dye, puffy sleeves and square necks, slips, knit polos, knits in general including lounge, flowy dresses, sneakers. Its a lean towards simple dressing but relaxed and a little flirty/romantic/sweet.
text:Out of personal curiosity and my own lack of knowledge- why do you use 'folx' instead of 'folks'? To my knowledge 'folks' is gender and ethnically neutral?	labels:I work at a nonprofit that serves and employs minorities including trans/nonbinary/fluid individuals. Its just a habit of inclusion to acknowledge people who like to use womxn, latinx, and etc to say we acknowledge non gender conforming. It lets them know I'm at least a little accepting, instead of just wondering and choosing to be more guarded out of anxiety. Its only one change in syllable and harmless imo, so I just do it. It's in my everyday language too, regardless of who I'm taking to.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else have ‚Äúirony pieces‚Äù?	labels:- Skinny jeans. I've always been a boot-cut person when it comes to pants (I look really good in them ngl). My grandma, my mom and I are strangely all the same size (we're the same height and roughly the same weight). My grandma brings over clothing she doesn't like or doesn't wear anymore and she brought over a pair of skinny jeans one time and my mom gave them to me. They fit really well and I ended up buying more pairs because of it.  - Not really a specific piece, but I've worn more yellow ever since a group of ladies complimented me heavily on wearing yellow lol. I had never really worn lots of yellow before, but I distinctly remember a time at work a couple of years ago where I was wearing a nice yellow shirt, and a group of three ladies were buying stuff and they said stuff like "oh, look at your shirt! Yellow is such a good color on you!" and other things like that lol. Really put a smile on my face and encouraged me to wear the color yellow more often :)
text:I love this so much! I had a car of girls at a gas station yell out the windows of their car that they loved my boots and my whole style (I have these flowered chunky heeled boots I got from justfab that get AT LEAST one complement every time I wear them) and was wearing dark grey leggings with an oversized light pink button up blouse and long (knee length)  gray cardigan sweater- had taken time to match my tunnels with my septum ring for extra pizazz that day, too. It became my favorite outfit!  I love when women complement each other and try to do it as often as i can because of how good it feels to get complemented by other women. I put outfits together with a lot of thought, so it's nice when someone notices!	labels:Aww, that's a nice story too :)  I'd compliment people more often but I'm shy üòÖ but I agree, compliments from other women feel great lol	episode_done:True
text:Is fast fashion really fast fashion if you get years of use out of the garments?	labels:The name fast fashion doesn't stem from the amount of use the consumer gets out of the product, but the fact that all fast fashion brands take all clothes at the end of the season or "trend" and burn them. Fast fashion is the second biggest contributor to the declining environment. In supporting them you're essentially contributing to these horrible actions.

text:What are the Recurring Motifs, Symbols, or Images in your Style?	labels:I love metallic. I patiently wait for november/december when I can buy sweaters with metallic thread. Sequins are great too!  I adore subtle whimsy. A floral blouse, but there's unicorn there too. Just enough to keep it from looking childish. It takes a second glance to notice.  My favorite scarf was bought at the London Natural Museum and have dinosaur pattern. I would LOVE to have more dinosaurs, but good luck finding it outside boy's clothing. Kate Spade had a dino purse awhile back, but it was a tad expensive. Otherwise I adore it.  I am not overly picky, birds, animals, bugs prints, as long as it's the whole animal. But it's REALLY hard to find, particularly of you want something else then cats or horses.   I still regret that I didn't have a cheap gecko broach fixed instead of throwing it away, never managed to replace it.
text:As a former employee of a natural history museum, I know all about trying to incorporate dinos in a tasteful way. Etsy has some cool jewellry that pulls in dino bone and fossil imagery so it looks a little more grown up, but finding clothes with dinos on it that doesn't look like it's for little kids is tough!

text:How many pairs of jeans and pairs of shoes should you own?	labels:I think it's interesting that you hone in on "needs" when for many people fashion fills a hybrid function of both hobby and utility. Both shoes and purses seem prone to being "collector's items" moreso than other garments (leggings, sweaters, etc.) and it makes sense to me as a fashion hobbyist and collector that people would have more than they "need" or use regularly. Also, as people age they typically gain more buying power, space to store things, and access to various occasions (business events, formal events, lifestyle changes that may necessitate a wider variety of things to fulfill a wider variety of functions).   Furthermore, I haven't found this sub's focus on "purging"/closet cleaning reflected in real life--while people do obviously consign or donate old clothing, it's pretty common for people to keep things or simply put things in storage as their use wanes. So on that note, it seems unsurprising that people have a handful of things that see constant rotation and a handful of things that are rarely used but are still enjoyed, so there is no reason to get rid of them.
text:Fwiw I know at least two men who own a ton of shoes and hats. As in 50+ pairs and a store rack worth of hats. One of them collects sneakers as a hobby while the other just likes his shoes and hats to match every outfit. I would guess it's similar for women who own a lot of purses.   I personally don't like purses at all so I only have one for when I absolutely have to (dress codes at fancy events, weddings etc). With "nice" shoes it's hard to find any that are remotely comfortable, so I see a lot of women buying various pairs of torture devices in hope of finding the perfect ones, only to end up with a ton of impractical footwear that never gets worn. I myself own 3 pairs of ballet flats that give me blisters and I haven't got rid of yet. But then if I'm invited somewhere I won't have any nice shoes and idk if I should keep the toe blisters ones or the heel blisters ones or the ones that fall off my foot every other step.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Has anyone else ever tried on a designer item just to see what the hype is about?	labels:Whenever people talk about designer being "worth it" or the prices "justified" - people get all twisted up in knots because worth is so subjective and hugely variant based on personal taste, exposure, and personal finances. It's common in these discussions for negative connotations of high end designer to sneak in. The unsaid being that the woman who thinks the price tag of high end designer is justified is snobby, materialistic, classist, wasteful, a show-off, out of touch, or at very minimum - their values are out of whack and have they first prioritized their family and their 401k?  So let's put worth aside and just talk about whether or not there is a noticeable difference in quality (both material and construction). The short answer is yes. And typically, the more expensive you go, the more noticeable it is.   So how do you explain the whole "I spent so much $$$ on _________ and it wasn't better than _________"?   I visualize clothing quality as one large spectrum, and each brand with its own mini-range of quality in between. Not every ‚Äúname brand‚Äù has good quality. Most vary quite a bit - some pieces being good, some bad. The good items overlap with brands at a higher price point, the bad items overlap with brands at a lower price point and once in awhile an item performs spectacularly or fails spectacularly. Some people put all ‚Äúluxe designer‚Äù at the far right/top of the spectrum - but like everything else, there are different ‚Äútiers‚Äù that correspond with price point [think LV vs. Gucci vs. Chanel vs. Hermes handbags]. But back to clothes, the variation in quality is especially noticeable in the $100-200 per piece category (Frame, Theory, Vince, A.P.C., ATM, Lafayette 148 NYC, Rebecca Taylor, Veronica Beard ...there‚Äôs so many). Once you get really up there (Akris Punto, St. John, Adam Lippes, Brunello Cuccinnelli, The Row, Celine, Dior etc. etc.), the tolerance for mediocre quality really decreases but doesn't completely disappear.  But what about [insert exception here]? Yep. There's plenty of outliers where the hype or marketing or styling overcomes quality or vice versa. Speaking of quality alone, Reformation is hugely overpriced and Hanes ultraweight cotton basics hugely underpriced. Some designers put quality first, some designers put innovation first, some brands dominate a particular niche, others are old names recently acquired and gutted by private equity.   And now add to that the ‚Äúhuman error‚Äù in quality perception. The people reviewing who forgot that they bought a made-for-outlet item (or who don‚Äôt make the distinction); the ones that don‚Äôt differentiate between main line and diffusion lines and thus conclude that Ralph Lauren is mediocre to based on RLRL,  the ones that define quality as ‚ÄúI threw it in the washer AND dryer and it came out fine;‚Äù the ones that paid full price and the ones that thrifted it at 10% of the cost and their different expectations accordingly. And then fundamentally, quality is often evaluated by looking backwards - when I say my [brand name] sweater held up perfectly over 10 years, I‚Äôm really speaking about the quality of the brand 10 years ago and not today.  Still, we can generally say that from a 9000 f.t. perspective, price and quality generally go hand in hand.   So what is someone new to fashion or who could never afford [insert high end designer] make of all of that? What is "good," "bad", or "worth it"? I for one am a huge proponent of going to fancy stores (or even just the fancy corner of Nordstrom, Bloomingdales, or Saks) and just feeling the fabrics on the rack. Pre-COVID, I'd do this all the time. I really believe that anyone with no special knowledge of fabrics or construction can still quickly pick out high end designer pieces by feel alone, eyes closed. It's even better if you try on a piece or two. It's even better if you turn the shirt inside out and notice the hems, the clasps, the bias cut, the darting, the difference made by ‚Äúfully lined.‚Äù Maybe it inspires you to thrift. Maybe it helps you pick out the "good" for brands in your price range. Maybe it gets you to think about what makes this piece work? What do I like about it? What do I dislike? What clever things did the designer do? Or didn't do? There is really no substitute for seeing and feeling yourself.   I think the biggest barrier for many people trying this out is judgement. Sometimes it's imagined, sometimes it's real. I've definitely had sales associates not-subtly ask where I live, whether I own or rent, what I do for a living, etc. Sometimes they ignore me entirely. Sometimes they follow me around the store. Sometimes they are absolutely fantastic and helpful and I'm just having a negative-internal-dialogue day. Some people don't find it at all intimidating, others can brush that stuff off - I can on good days, can't on bad. If this is something you're interested in, high end consignment stores (or even normal thrift stores in very high end neighborhoods) are the bomb for a casual atmosphere and the opportunity to touch and feel the hell out of some really nice stuff.
text:>Frame, Theory, Vince, A.P.C., ATM, 3.1 Phillip Lim, Lafayette 148 NYC, Rebecca Taylor  So from your list of mid-tier brands, which ones do you think are usually high-quality? I own a couple things from Frame, 3.1 Phillip Lim, and Rebecca Taylor, and the cardigan I got at 3.1 Phillip was super thin and flimsy, the jeans at Frame were thinner than Levis denim, but the 2 dresses and pants at Rebecca Taylor have held up pretty well and are well constructed and not thin.	labels:Ohhh such a difficult question! Honestly even a t-shirt I bought at EF recently got returned for being too thin.  I love Agolde for jeans. L‚ÄôAgence and Cami NY have been consistently better for me for silk blouses than Equipment. Coach, Longchamp, and Oroton IMO outperform their price category for bags. I typically prefer Lafayette 148 to Vince, Vince to Theory and Boss.	episode_done:True

text:What was your "how in the name of all that is holy did this end up in a thrift store" find?	labels:It‚Äôs less about the value of the item and more about the stars aligning perfectly.  I wear a size 12-13W shoe, plus other things that make my feet really hard to fit, so I am used to buying formalwear to match the one maybe two pairs of formal shoes I own at any given time.  So when I was 17 and going to prom in 2006, my mom tried really hard to help me find shoes, any shoes, that were suitable. But we could only find casual flats or runners, and I realllly wanted to dress up nicely for the first real time in my life. So she said ‚Äúyou know what, let‚Äôs buy a dress and then we will just have to find a way.‚Äù  So I picked out a black and pale pink dress that just made me swoon, and I figured black heels would be easiest to find. Lol I was so young and stupid.  Anyway we searched high and low right up until the week of prom, we drove to the US from Canada and looked there and I still couldn‚Äôt find a pair of heels that fit enough to buy and I decided I‚Äôd just wear uncomfy like always and deal with it.   Then I randomly walked into a thrift store and saw on the shoe rack a pair of pink heels in the exact shade of pink on my dress, with black trim. Picked them up, size 12W. They fit like they were made for me.   Wore them until they broke three years ago.
text:I can somewhat relate. My mom wears an 11W. I grew up watching her struggle endlessly to find shoes. She‚Äôs also an avid thrifter. For some reason I‚Äôve long been better than her at spotting the one random pair of 11Ws in sight, whether thrift shop or regular store. Even since I moved out I find things for her regularly and mail them. (And send the bill.) I‚Äôll usually text her, but I know her style well enough that I‚Äôm comfortable buying stuff without her approval. I know I‚Äôve found several pairs she wears almost daily.	labels:Aw this warms my heart a lot. I do some similar shopping for my mom, especially since she became disabled now to the point of being practically unable to walk. She can‚Äôt shop for herself in stores now but even when she could, it was always as if I could just find those weird little things that make her life easier so much more frequently. I‚Äôve kept doing that since moving further from home but it‚Äôs been a long time now since I‚Äôve gotten her anything and now I‚Äôm going to try and keep my eyes open more	episode_done:True

You really just have to check all the ones in your area out and decide for yourself which has the best selection and prices. Also, figure out which days they do sales (my SA has a color tag for 99 cents on Fridays) and plan trips strategically. I moved from a city to a small town and at first was really disappointed in the thrifting since I rarely find modern brand name items, but the prices are way better, there is lots of great vintage, and I feel like there are less 'trendy' people shopping for the same style of items as I am.

What has helped for me was to ditch the fruit shaped body types and use Kibbe instead. Kibbe worked much better for me because it doesn‚Äôt just focus on one aspect of my body (hip to waist to breast ratios) but instead focuses on what my body looks like as a whole, including my facial features and bone structure. I know that some people don‚Äôt like Kibbe and it‚Äôs not for everyone but it might be something worth exploring just to help you get some sort of idea of what may or may not look great on your body.
text:What is kibbe?	labels:An alternate body type theory developed in the 1980s. It's kind of woo-woo (lots of Yin and Yang energy talk), taking a more holistic approach to body type as well as personality and face shape. It also seems more positive to me? Like instead of telling you what not to wear because you are a pear, it suggests how to complement your body shape and has lovely descriptors for each (although the fruit shapes aren't negative either, we have just made them loaded words.)

text:Where do you get good quality, legit wool sweaters that won't rip/shrink after washing?	labels:My woolllies are Benetton's.

I also have a few handamde so they don't count here.  They are old, though - or vintage.  Apart from my Kiwi jumpers, as said here alteady, which can be machine washed (but in cold water, delicate cycle and inside a mesh bag), you cannot wash them in the washing machine. They may not rip if inside a laundry bag, but they will certainly felt. Somebody told me the spin cycle is what destroys them, but my machine spins while rinsing as well, so it's a no-no anyway.   Using Woolite is enough to make them last for many years. Good quality wool jumpers will last a very long time if well cared for.  Having said that, I must confess I absolutely loathe washing anything by hand. So my woollies don't get worn a lot anymore....  They are > 10 yrs old btw  Good luck!!	episode_done:True

More specifically, the (relatively) less proper version of it. And you wouldn‚Äôt say a suit jacket is an outerwear.  Because an outerwear would be either an overcoat for more formal occasions and a coverall for less proper, manual labour working (at least back then) occassions. So think of it like t shirt -> denim jacket -> denim coverall for workwear and button up shirt -> suit jacket -> overcoat for a more a more dressed up occassion.  Because button up shirts (alongside t shirts) are actually the underlayer, and wasn‚Äôt meant to be seen in public back then. That‚Äôs why in some dressing codes it‚Äôs considered improper to wear an undershirt beneath a button up shirt. And that‚Äôs why waistcoat of old have a very high buttoning point.	episode_done:True

text:Advice needed: How to keep up with trends without social media?	labels:Your best bet is going old school and following blogs. Set up an RSS feed, find people you like, and follow fashion that way.   But this is also a good time for you to explore YOUR personal style, without the influence of... uh... influencers. Obviously some of the fun of fashion is finding out what the trends are as dictated by other people, but with a little freedom from those, you might create silhouettes and combinations that are far more interesting to you personally than whatever's popping off on IG this week.  You can also do what I do and set up an IG that's just for this kind of thing. I don't follow anyone I know, I don't post anything on there. It's just for me to keep up with fashion, some bands I like, and a few owls managed to sneak their way in there. If you set up something like that, you can set aside an hour on the weekend and get caught up on fashion stuff without even installing the app on your phone. A lot of influencers are on YouTube too, so if you'd prefer to stay away from IG altogether, you can just look for their YouTube pages and watch their content on the weekend.

text:Rick Owens Wearing Rick Owens	labels:I am late on this but happy birthday to Rick Owens. Rick Owens (Richard Saturnino Owens) is an American designer of his eponymous label. I really don't think I need to regurgitate everything that is mentioned in every interview or article about him.    These are all just images taken from Vogue Runway of him taking bows at the the end of his shows. I probably should've added some streetstyle and editorial shots of him and Michele.

text:People with crazy hair, how do you plan your outfits to go with your hair color?	labels:When I had pink hair it literally changed nothing for me. I miss her, she was so cute. I can still have crazy hair at work, I just got tired of the upkeep lol. It does make me do kind of different makeup? Not necessarily for coordination, but perhaps like intensity for when I have light pink hair to dark brown like I currently do.	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 01, 2021	labels:Hey all, I'm looking for a good pair of sturdy duck pants with a vintage/heritage flair. Ideally they'd be high waisted, straight-legged, and have a back buckle and/or brace buttons.   Something close to [this](https://bronsonshop.com/collections/pants-trousers/products/bronson-1930s-boss-of-the-road-heavy-duty-double-knees-duck-canvas-hunting-pants?variant=33940218085420) (which is absolutely perfect, but sold out of my size). I've seen some on Carhartt that have similar legs, but they still look a bit modern/not high waisted enough.   My price range would be $50-$150, I'd go higher for something really high quality. I'm in the US if that helps.  Heritage workwear folks, any suggestions?

text:How much was your most expensive fashion item and when or how often do you wear it?	labels:I bought a pair of $300+ Christian Dior DIORSTELLAIRE1 sunglasses. I bought them in June and wear them pretty much every time I go outside. They have a slim frame so they don't really stand out too much and overtake my outfit. The lense are polarised too which is perfect for the upcoming Australian summer. A good pair of sunnies is so important in my opinion	episode_done:True

text:I feel like blue skinny jeans are out but black skinny jeans are more classic so I'm sticking with those.     That said, I think our perception of what's flattering is partially shaped by what we're used to seeing. We've been looking at ourselves and other non-models in skinny jeans for the past decade. Straight and wide leg jeans are still new, so we've mostly seen them on models. There's still some objective elements though. Like I definitely think a higher rise makes the torso look shorter and the legs look longer so if you're long torsoed they'll probably always look better on you. I remember all the fashion magazines saying straight or flared cuts were more flattering back in the early 2000s.	labels:What the hell are wide leg leggings?!? I‚Äôm lost on this one!

text:[Serious answers only] FAQ: Why does runway fashion looks like nothing you'd ordinarily wear on the daily?	labels:A more underlooked reason: Runway shows are deliberately styled to catch the attention of the buyer, and to showcase the brand. But with the exception of a few pieces, the majority of clothing shown on the runway individually isn't that insane when taken out of the context of the outfit.  [Take this look from Craig Green SS21](https://i.imgur.com/qYiGFKM.jpg). It looks pretty mad, right? But break it down. The pants, shirt, shoes and jacket are all very wearable and not even that strange. It's just some slightly bizarre accessories that make it seem incessable. [And even with something completely off-kilter like this](https://i.imgur.com/dNHX52x.png) you can still isolate individual parts of the outfit that are more normal.	episode_done:True

I know it's not the freshest look, but it makes me happy so I do it. I do try to keep in mind how much goes into one outfit (a shirt with puppies on it *and* a bright skirt *and* colored rights *and* a headband is too much, but a shirt with puppies on it, layered under a blazer and with black pants is doable). And its kind of consistently my style, rather than something I randomly cling to every once in awhile, if that makes sense?

In fact, I would go so far as to say that the only reason he had any success at YSL is because it was down-market Dior for the pretenders and wannabes. That and their more streetwear-focused mass-market  styles, which by all accounts he had little input on.  Like, we get it, Hedi - the 60s were cool. Now can you do something that isn't James Dean in Rebel Without A Cause? Do you really need to put out a very slightly different moto jacket every single year? Are you aware that there's a whole world of shoes beyond jodhpurs and monkstraps? Have you, perhaps, maybe heard that things didn't stop becoming cool after 1970?  Look, I know I'm not nearly as cool as Hedi Slimane. Never will be. But on the flip side, how cool can someone be if they completely stop developing their style in their 20s and refuse to depart from that for the rest of their lives? At that point, are you really still cool? Or are you Jimmy Buffett, singing songs you wrote 40 years ago while well-past-middle-aged women their panties at you at a casino named after one of your more mediocre tunes, your beer gut hanging out from a rumpled Hawaii shirt, your assistant keeping a careful eye on the clock just off stage because damnit, this is a business, and you're not going to play for a second longer than the audience paid for? Is that what you want to be, Hedi?  And I get that all designers have a bit of a signature, but damnit even Rick Owens manages to come up with new and creative and amazing ways to dress people, despite his obsession with Bauhaus-meets-Misfits grotesquery. And I even get why people wear and love your clothes, because who could possibly not see the appeal in that post-War french louchness. I get it - we all want to feel like we've just ridden our Vespa to a cafe to discuss Camus and Truffaut and how De Gaulle is not fit to lead France and how the new girl at the free university screams lines from the classics when she comes, your cigarette slowly burning to ash while you ponder the colossal waste that is your life and how little that matters. But for the love of god do something that couldn't come from your first runway sure as easily as your last.  Sorry, I have strong feelings about Slimane.
text:I definitely think you've shared some really valid criticisms of Slimane about his repetitiveness and his inspiration as a designer, but am not sure I am understanding the rest of your frustration which seems to be directed at him as an individual if I am reading you correctly.   As I mentioned, I think there are brands that are doing the look Hedi engenders in ways that are more interesting or creative (such as Husbands Paris, Holiday Boileau, even Aime Leon Dore to some extent) but even being critical you just painted a specific, rich visual picture of the era and aesthetic that Slimane is trying to emulate, which to me seems like the whole point. If even a critic can paint an accurate descriptive picture of what you want your collections to evoke that seems to be a pretty powerful success to me.  Again, I don't disagree with your assessment that his shows are often repetitive, and that's why I also tried to put as many photos from the era he is using for inspiration at Celine in this album rather than his own pieces, because that is what is a little more interesting to me. However, selling nostalgia isn't unique to Slimane, and I'd be curious if you feel similarly frustrated with Ralph Lauren for selling staid Americana over and over again?	labels:It's not so much a criticism of him as an individual so much as criticism of him as an artist and as a public figure. I really know nothing about him as an individual. Mostly, I'm frustrated and a bit puzzled with the acclaim he gets in certain circles for his artistic expression, which I feel is mediocre at best. Not because it isn't technically good, and not because he doesn't achieve his desired outcome - like you said, he clearly paints a vivid picture with his clothes - but because he never transcends the mundane or tests his own artistic boundaries.  That sounds like a really pretentious thing to say, and it is, but I feel like it's a valid criticism. I say the same thing about the Hudson Valley School in art, and about Damien Hirst, and Manet, and JJ Abrams. All are artists that have achieved a high level of technical mastery in their craft - the things they create are well-thought-out, well-made, and line up well with what a good example of *thing* should look like. But it never goes past the "this is a well-made example of *thing.*" These artists never challenge themselves to do something new, or push the limits of what *thing* can be. They play it safe, and while that ensures they never fail, it also keeps their *thing* inside a very conventional box that limits how much it can succeed.   You bring up Ralph Lauren, which I actually think is a perfect counterpoints to Slimane. Ralph Lauren isn't a high fashion designer, not really. Sure, the Purple Label gets pricey, but for most of RL, the styles are priced such that anyone can easily wander in off the street and buy whatever. It's mass market, and it's a brand more than a person. To use a food analogy, I don't expect creativity and inventiveness from McDonald's, or even Olive Garden. But I do expect creativity and inventiveness and a constant yearning to do more from haute cuisine - if Eleven Madison Park didn't regularly change their menu and try new combinations, I would have been sorely disappointed. They would become Peter Lugar's, hanging on to past glories and no longer giving a shit about the art of what they were doing. Slimane, at Dior, YSL, and now Celine, is not Ralph Lauren. One could walk into a Ralph Lauren store and buy an entire outfit for the price of a single pair of pants or t-shirt at Dior/YSL/Celine. We should expect more from people claiming to operate in the loftiest reaches of high fashion than we do from a mass market comfort brand.	episode_done:True

And if you're half asleep trying to buy a last minute gift for a relative and it's placed next to other nice brand/celebrity fragrances... I have to stop myself from falling for it every three years or so.
text:Once I traveled to NYC and left all my socks and underwear at home (pro tip: if you use packing cubes you must eventually put them in your suitcase) so I went to some 99c store and bought some Beverly Hills Polo Club socks, which I thought was hilarious bc over on the west coast our Polo knockoff is New York Polo Club.  I guess it‚Äôs more exotic!  Another confusing knockoff (def not designer related though) was American Eagle brand shoes at Payless.  I assumed incorrectly for a long time that they were related to the brand American Eagle, not sure how I got that idea but apparently I was wrong.	labels:Start with the empty packing cube inside your open suitcase first üòÇ that way it‚Äôs already in the right place as you fill it	episode_done:True

text:Feminist clothing	labels:[A New Vision of Lingerie: Men Not Required](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/07/fashion/new-lingerie-designed-by-women.html)  Article about bras historically being made by men, and interviewing the owner of Third Love, a rare female-operated manufacturer. Article is on NYTimes so apologies if there's a paywall issue. Might not be feminist in outward appearance - you mentioned male ownership and it brought this article to mind.  Also, possibly random and off-topic but only very recently been introduced to the history of Mary Quant as a female fashion designer celebrity who helped bring the miniskirt to popularity in the 60's. Kinda neat reading if you're into that sort of thing. For her first designs, she had to lie and tell garment makers they wanted a whole bunch of extra-long sweaters and then sold them as skirts. Once it was profitable, lo and behold the garment-makers began lessening their uppity-ness about it.
text:IMO Fleur du Mal is much higher quality lingerie from a female run brand, size inclusive, sex positive, everything is made in small batches and employees at all levels are paid really well. I've found ThirdLove to be uncomfortable and quality to vary a lot piece to piece.	labels:One single pair of polyester underwear from them costs $70. Polyester. Not silk, not cotton.

text:Do you feel the black Friday sales better or worse than usually this year? Is it worth to buy clothing you won't wear until next year?	labels:Maybe this is just the stores I'm looking at, but it seems like the new stuff that I'm actually interested in isn't on sale this Black Friday, but everything else that's not as good is 40% off. It's annoying, because splashing a big number like that ("30-50% off the whole site! \*exclusions apply") draws me to their site, but the items I actually want aren't a part of the sale.  The only exception being Levi's because I've been waiting for this 40% off sale to get a pair of Wedgie jeans.   Not going to lie, I did buy quite a few bits from the sales this year but with the intention of returning 90% of it because I don't feel comfortable going into stores to try stuff on. Best to buy everything I want to try on at sale prices then return what I don't want to keep!
text:This has always been something I hated! I also think that Black Friday sales are overblown and actually not that good (for clothes). I typically wait until January to shop for sales because that's when retailers are trying to dump inventory to make their year end numbers look better. (Fiscal year for retailers ends in January and doesn't follow the calendar year.)	labels:Oh that's a good idea! I can reliably count on shops like Madewell, Levi's, Abercrombie & Fitch, etc. to have sales at the end of the season. The only problem is whether or not they'll have my size when the sale happens or if they're sold out of everything except XS and XL...	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- November 05	labels:does anyone have experience with h&m shirts, shorts etc? I'm confused about the sizes.  do the sizes match traditional US sizes? I see their models wearing mediums and they're like 6'2. I'm only 5'9, about 190. I wear larges myself. I've bought their hoodies in large and they fit fine. I'm concerned about shirts. I'm definitely bulkier in general than some of their models who are tall and skinny, and not sure if a medium would be the right fit. and with shorts, I've been looking at the sweatshorts and their 6'2 models still wear mediums. they also don't specify inseam length. personally measuring my own inseam, a 9 inch one would be nicely above my knee and I like them showing a little leg. but I don't wanna order their shorts and have the waist be too small because I ordered a medium when I should have gotten a large. or have the inseam be too long. I need a better guide and h&m doesn't provide it and it's really frustrating because I love their hoodies. the quality is super nice and I want to get other things.
text:Height has very little to do with sizing. It's mostly about chest/shoulder, waist and inseam measurements.  I'm 6'2, but I have a 36" chest so I often wear a small, my waist is 29" so I can often wear small or extra small bottoms if the inseam is long enough.   Measure the chest of something that fits you well and compare to their size chart.

text:How much of your income do you spend on average in clothes every month?	labels:When I was a student, I did buy quite a lot of fast fashion (e.g. Primark) and high street items, particularly when there was a good sale on. I enjoyed it and was exploring my style, and it was all balanced by not spending as much on nights out, drinking and takeaways.  Once I started working, I divided up my money into buckets: monthly fun money (¬£100) that can roll up, monthly luxury savings money (¬£100) that would accumulate until I could afford the ¬£¬£¬£ item I wanted, monthly travel/experience money budget that would also accumulate, general bills and the rest into savings. Ultimately these numbers are arbitrary and was the way that allowed me to splurge sensibly whilst saving, guilt free.

text:How do comfort vs. style compare in what bottoms you wear?	labels:I mostly wear jeans/pants and I find them to be very comfortable personally. I'm honestly always a little surprised that they're so uncomfortable for most people. Most of my discomfort in skirts/dresses is mental (I just don't feel like me when I wear them).   I think if you enjoy wearing skirts you should keep wearing them, nothing wrong with that. If it's a seasonal thing maybe fleece stockings or something like that will allow you to wear them in the cooler months.
text:I have found people overwhelmingly wear clothes a size too small (like speaking to friends and whatnot). My sister, for example, buys the same size leggings as I do despite her hips and waist being 5-6 inches larger than mine, and then complains about them being see through. I have strong suspicions that this is the reason people find thongs horrifically uncomfortable as well.	labels:And i buy a size larger leggings than i should because, guess what, if you buy larger leggings they are never see through, panty lines don't show, you don't ooze out the top, and they don't try to creep off of your body.

text:What did your mom teach you about fashion/style - and what did she not teach you?	labels:She taught me what matches and doesn‚Äôt match and what‚Äôs appropriate for when.

How to do my own manicures and what cuticles are, those sorts of things.   The only thing she did not teach me was good skincare which was awful because my sister and I inherited our dads horrible skin. But it‚Äôs not her fault, she was the kind of teenager that had one pimple her whole adolescent life.   A funny one, when the show the Nanny was on she would point out how the Nanny looked sexy and not trashy. If you look at a lot of Frans outfits, she‚Äôs usually either showing legs or cleavage (occasionally both but the focal point is usually on one). Not both at once, she would always say you want to emphasize one of your ‚Äúfeminine features‚Äù but not both at the same time because it‚Äôs ‚Äútoo much‚Äù to look at lol.

text:What are you hate wearing?	labels:This is half my wardrobe! I have a pair of men‚Äôs XL thermal shirts that are huge but super comfy. I‚Äôve been wearing them for 6 years. I‚Äôve worn thumb holes into the sleeves.   Honestly though, I find I own beautiful clothes but...I keep them for a ‚Äúspecial occasion‚Äù. I worry I‚Äôll ruin them.   I‚Äôve made an effort to get a few cute lounge wear outfits but I still change out of them if I need to do dishes or I‚Äôm eating messy food because I might ruin it.   So I go back to the stuff I don‚Äôt care if I stain.	episode_done:True

text:Shitpost Saturday: Advice on Learning How to Hate Fashion	labels:My journey into hating fashion began when I started to develop an effortless aesthetic. So, I stopped putting in any effort. And once I started being effortless, I realized just how much effort everything took. Like, do you realize how much effort trying six different dresses or jeans on just to find one that fits takes?!! Or making sure that the outfit you pick matches?! Like, who wants to walk around looking like they put effort into wearing clothes?! So now all I wear is black sack dresses and beanies to hide my uncombed hair. It takes me three seconds to get dressed. Turns out, the only way to really achieve effortlessness is to realize that fashion is effort.

text:YOOO  I‚Äôve voted in a similar way throughout the rounds.

text:Store closings at malls	labels:I pretty infrequently went to the mall, but stores closing retail locations really doesn't impact their online store much. It can, if the stores are fulfilling the orders, but most major brands should be adapted to online long before today and are able to fulfill orders. It impacts the business in that they're not getting the retail location revenue but they're already established online with processes and can usually just adapt. Unfortunately, brands with retail locations can't be like Amazon because Amazon's business is really hosting the retail of other brands with some of its own products, which means it has more resources and volume to make various returns, deliveries, etc. more efficient. It's not without its issues itself. Unfortunately, it's a hard time for retailers. :(	episode_done:True

text:How much was your most expensive fashion item and when or how often do you wear it?	labels:I have a pair of platform doc martens  (~$140) in a deep maroon that I love, I haven't been brave enough to wear them to work yet (white collar, no dress code, just feels a little weird), but I wear them everywhere else. Shoes and jewelry are my top high cost items. Real leather shoes last forever. My bf got me a simple bezel set diamond necklace for graduating and I wear that with everything too  Tbh quality fabrics (linen, silk, leather etc.) are worth the cost, but 'name brands' aren't. Goodwill, or etsy if you want something new and specific, have given me my favorite pieces. I got a $300 J. Crew wool coat for $30 from the goodwill online store. If you're patient, you can build a lovely wardrobe that didn't cost so much you're afraid to wear it.

It's good that you're looking for inspo, now you go through it with an analytical mind and try to find the pattern. Then you try to reproduce.

(Think Rowing Blazers meets The Ragged Priest.)   I've become really obsessed with rugby shirts, but I can never find any for women! I wouldn't mind wearing men's rugbies (and I've found some pretty cool ones), except that I'm reasonably busty and men's cuts never fit properly on me. So in 2021 I really want to find some neat sub-$100 women's rugby shirts‚Äîam very much open to suggestions, so send them my way if you can think of any! (Especially if easily available in Canada)

text:How many clothes do you have? (Really?)	labels:Disclaimer-- I will NEVER have a capsule wardrobe (unless I'm living out of a suitcase).  I've realized that I am not a minimalist when it comes to fashion and beauty.  The one thing that people fail to take into consideration with minimalist wardrobes is their laundry situation.  It is one thing if you are part of a large family (therefore doing laundry on a daily basis).  But I'm single, live alone, and use shared laundry facilities (pay per load).  It makes more financial sense for me to have more clothes and doing laundry less often (I pay the same whether the load is full or not, so I might as well wash full loads).  I draw the line at hand-washing clothes (I already dry them on a drying rack).
text:Yes!!! Very true! When you need to pay by the load you really can't waste money on half loads..... especially when your machine only takes coins.   If I had my own machine, I would likely make some changes if it had a half load setting. But for now I do it every 2 weeks or so....maybe in the winter I can do it weekly because I will have a full enough load of darks..	labels:	episode_done:True

It would be nice if they picked a jewel tone or something with more strength, like a forest green or even a bolder marigold sort of yellow.

Also lazy and kind of in kahoots with brands trying to offload old designs and colorways on us like it's some new thing. It strikes me as almost deceptive. We don't know where 2021 is going yet, but what I can tell you with certainty is it's not going to be hitting a reset button to where it's magically 2013 again.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:General Discussion - October 19	labels:My country went back into lockdown and so I have finally conceded to the new way of life.  Realistically, I'll be wearing homewear most days, but most of my other clothes just *feel nicer* than the cheapass sweatpants I own. So I got a new pair of sweatpants + a sweatshirt from Sunspel.  I really wish It hadn't had to come to this. I promise I won't leave the house in them.

text:How has the quality changed over the years at some of your fav brands?	labels:I feel like Abercrombie and Fitch has turned around! I love all the dresses I've bought from them - almost all have been lined and a lot of them have pockets! I'm so pleased.
text:Interesting! I recently bought some stuff from them this summer. I think their clothes are definitely a lot cuter than they were in the past. However, the quality hasn‚Äôt been there for me. Snags on the linen jumpsuit I‚Äôve worn once and the bodysuit snaps don‚Äôt stay snapped.	labels:I bought a bunch of stuff this summer but the sizing surprised me! I was buying large expecting high school sizes... I was wrong everything was huge! I kept one shirt, a white linen button down and it‚Äôs been everything. Loved the vegan suede skirt but it was a big too big so I had to return.    Also got some stuff for SO. He has worn linen shorts daily and super soft long sleeve- we only had to return one item of his, a linen cotton t-shirt with a button pocket that hung weird.	episode_done:True
text:Your favourite men's style shopping "hacks"	labels:For footwear especially, there is a lot of high quality vintage out there for great prices. Lightly used Allen Edmonds, vintage Florshiem, and old defunct shoemakers can be found for sub-$100. A comparable new shoe can't really be found for under $200 at the bare minimum.
text:One caution though - shoes can be one of those things where they break in one time and then never really re-form to a new owner. That feeling can be mitigated, but probably not eliminated by resoling the used pair. I‚Äôve had new vs used shoes in the same size and last that felt very different on my feet, to the point where I ended up selling the used pair.   Personally, I now only ever buy secondhand pairs that have minimal or no wear on them. That‚Äôs still pretty common to find due to propensity for sizing mistakes or sellers who have large collections that don‚Äôt get much use.	labels:Fully agree. One addition is that it‚Äôs possible for good cobblers to renew the entire sole and footbed of welted shoes (Alden even does this through their factory restoration service).	episode_done:True

text:Can you have a clothing style without actually wearing that certain style much?	labels:I wouldn't, but only because I think that when you're describing your style, you're aiming to give other people an idea of what you actually wear, day to day, as concisely as possible.  If even your basic looks have alternative elements, it might make sense, otherwise there's nothing wrong with "basic, occasionally grunge-y."  That said, you don't only have to stick to one style, and it's not as though it's not part of you because you're not wearing it all the time.	episode_done:True

And my waist is 44. Man what is going on here. I should have outgrown these 38w pants a long time ago? Why such a big discrepancy?

text:Can we discuss how uncomfortable it can be to dress fashionably sometimes? Must beauty = pain? Looking for comfort tips!	labels:Fashion definitely shouldn't be painful! That being said, we all have different ideas of comfortable and uncomfortable.   For shoes and bras, fit is so important! It's really common to wear a bra that doesn't fit right or a shoe that's cute and cheap but doesn't have any support to it or properly fit your foot. If you can invest in things that fit properly, they shouldn't be uncomfortable or require a lot of fussing. Also with shoes, you can look at lower heels, block heels and wedges for more support as well, as they can help distribute your weight a little better than stilettos will.  I agree on high-waisted jeans. All my pants are stretchy and basically thick leggings in disguise now. They're incredibly comfortable while also looking professional and/or stylish, and it's the best thing ever. They're also great for weight fluctuations! I think more and more brands are starting to make them too, because I'm seeing a lot of variety on the thrift store racks.  For tights, the first thing I would do is go see a doctor to get those taken care of. They run in my family, and it's a pretty simple office visit procedure where they just numb your toe and put something on it to keep it from growing. The toenail doesn't look the prettiest afterward, but it's way better than being in pain. Also, I would imagine that just avoiding control top tights would take care of the waist tightness? I have to wear control top to get them to stay up at all, but I feel like a lot of people avoid it for comfort.  All in all, I think if you pay attention to fit and go for materials with stretch and softness, that should let you feel both comfortable and stylish!

Their Stafford heavyweight Ts are the absolute best I‚Äôve found for a white t-shirt. They also come in black and gray, I believe. Great, heavy-weight 100% cotton fabric that lasts for years and stands up to countless washes, including the occasional dose of bleach (for the whites). The large fits a 6‚Äô2‚Äù guy at 215 pounds snugly, but relaxes a bit with wear. On sale they can be bought for $28 for a pack of three or sometimes four. Want more colors? JCP‚Äôs Xersion 100% cotton Ts are my go to. I get the XL for a more relaxed fit. Great quality as well, plenty of colors to choose from and I‚Äôve found them for as little as $6 each on sale. Granted, JCP isn‚Äôt an ‚Äúit‚Äù brand, but the quality of their Ts has kept me coming back to them for more than 20 years.

I haven‚Äôt tried their tees but your comment makes me want to lol	labels:I‚Äôd be interested see your review, since you obviously have a handle on the finer details regarding fit and neckline.

text:How do you think access and privilege affect your taste and sense of style?	labels:Interesting observations! It does remind me of something from my own life. I grew up in an island in the Caribbean that doesn‚Äôt have the classic clothing chain stores that the US has. Some of the richer families on island would do ‚Äúshopping trips‚Äú where they would fly to New York, Boston, Miami etc. and just shop for five or six days and then come home. Lots of these kids would then be wearing clothes from stores the rest of us couldn‚Äôt buy from (this was long before online shopping) and it became kind of a status symbol to wear lots of Abercrombie and Fitch, Hollister, Roxy etc. to kind of flaunt the fact that you could afford to do that kind of shopping.   Nowadays I live in Canada and I definitely feel like the online shopping has kind of closed that gap between people who can afford to physically go to a fancy store, especially with thrift/resale you can end up ordering and owning high fashion items for fairly cheap compared to back in the day.

text:Being Slouchy in Classic Menswear	labels:Okay, I‚Äôve been on a roll with writing essays lately. It‚Äôs different to write about *thoughts* on menswear rather than deep dives on specific pieces!  This one (on stuffiness & slouch) is a topic that is quite important to me, as I felt like I‚Äôve been hinting at a deep dive on it for a long time.  You could think of this as an expanded take on [this piece](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/627tqd/yes_you_can_put_your_hands_in_your_suit_pockets/) I wrote 3 years ago.   As a younger guy who got his start wearing cringe clothing (and I still do), I think actively avoiding stuffiness and embracing slouch is one of the tenets of my personal style. While it does involve a [wide silhouette](https://streetxsprezza.wordpress.com/2020/08/16/embracing-the-wide-legged-trouser/), I think it‚Äôs about attitude as well and treating tailoring as just anything else.  I know some of you will object to a lot of the stuff in this post (and especially the pictures), but believe me when I say that its mainly because we don't want to look like a typical lawyer/finance guy/explore page influencer. Sometimes this means opting for "alternative" things like wide fit, bucket hats, and corduroy suits, but for some (who still wear worsted suits and spread collars), it can simply be an irreverent attitude.  Obviously  YMMV, as some people will *not* see that you're trying to be slouchy, but hey, you tried lol   I heavily suggest listening to the [podcast episode](https://soundcloud.com/styleanddirection/sad60/s-0Wx5jmx8LbM) before reading this, as I had my discussion with Spencer *first* before writing the rest of my thoughts in this essay.  I hope you enjoy and add some slouch to your menswear ;)
text:Thanks for your piece--loved some of the photos. Can you say more about how you differentiate "slouch" from wabi sabi or sprezzatura?	labels:I think in the pod proper, we say that slouch is basically sprezzatura (or our version of it). It's still "studied carlessness", if studied means that we wear specifically what we like and don't randomly put things on. Intentionality is important.  I made the distinction since I believe sprezzatura has been co-opted and been diluted thanks to #menswear.  Lots of pink/white pants, unbuttoned collars, and wrists full of bracelets when I think of sprezzatura. Not that any of those can't be pulled off in a slouchy way, but it just seems like a different colloquialism.  I wouldn't say that a Pitti Peacock is slouchy, but thats also just my bias.

text:The best relaxed trousers ‚Äî 13 bought and tested	labels:I wholeheartedly recommend Grammici as well.

In fact I'm [**so happy with my purchase**](https://i.imgur.com/sXYsNcy.jpg) (here paired in a more autumnal outfit) I now own two others in corduroy, and as OP stated, they are *very* versatile - I pair them with Drake's jackets, scarves and shoes and Berg & Berg coats, it works great.  One thing to note is that their carrot cut is very adapted to short people like I am (5'7) if you want to wear them more traditionally (just down the ankle) than their cut allows for taller people. And my thirty-smth slightly growing waistline has found them really accommodating as well.

text:Review - The Custom Russian Automatic Dive Watch (for less than 100 Dollars)	labels:TL;DR: I bought a russian diver watch from the 60s and it is awesome.     Intro / Backstory: Recently, I was shopping for a birthday present for my father. He is in his late 50's, and since we have bonded a lot over the last few years, after years of radio silence, I wanted to make a more personal present.     My dad is a typical "man's man", who likes scotch, cigars, classic rock, fishing, boats and painting - so I usually get him something that fits either of this categories. But this year I wanted to get something different.     I opted for buying him a watch. But since neither him nore me are big watch guys, I did not want to go for a brand that he would not recognize - but a Rolex, Breitling or Glash√ºtte was not in my price range either.    So I went a differnt route: Why not get something from his past? We are both from what used to be the German Democratic Republic (the soviet part of Germany). Back in the day getting a cool watch was almost impossible. Civilians only had two kinds to pick from, which would not be cool even back then. To get a cool watch you either had to smuggle it in from the west - or you had to bribe someone to get a high end military watch. The latter were hard to get but instantly recognizable.     Since my dad was in the navy, the watch to go for was the "VOSTOK AMPHIBIA" - and I bought one for myself as well.      Quality:     To my surprise, the AMPHIBIAs were still being made, just like they were in the 60's. The VOSTOK (meaning "east") watches are made in Chistopol - and they are the AK47s of watches. The AMPHIBIA is based on a Swiss design, because during the economic crisis of the early 20th century, the Soviets bought a Swiss Watch Making Company stock, lock and barrel. They drove all the machinery and the workers deep into the Russian hinterland, where they made a watch that is pretty much indestructible.     The automatic 2416 calibre comes with 31 jewels and has been gushed over for its precision by pretty much any watch critic I read. It is waterproof to 200 meters - and it actually becomes MORE waterpoof the deeper it goes. The quality is simply incredible, which made me question other watchmakers inflated prices.     As for the design: It's not a Rolex Submariner, but it is certainly is unique. The AMPHIBIA comes in a variety of looks - and you can even design your own. Since it is proper Soviet fashion to make all parts interchangable, you can mix and match them to your liking. You can go all stainless steel, all black or even choose funky primary colors and a KGB logo.    If you picked your own casing, wristband, bezel and watchface, you will not find a similar watch within a 500 miles radius. If you want your watch to be more recognizable, you should go for one that has the SCUBA DUDE watchface.      No matter what design you pick, though - the AMPHIBIA always looks unapologetically rugged and functional.      The wristbands however, are nothing to write home about. I suggest you replace them with something else. Leather cuffs work incredibly well, because they underline the rugged look. More on that later.     The luminescent hands could also be a little bit brighter, they are kinda hard to read if you did not spend a significant time in the sunlight.      Price: You can get a new one for less than 100 bucks. Yes, you read that right. For less then 100 Dollars you can get a well made custom, automatic watch that can go toe-to-toe with most top-tier watches - as long as it comes down to functionality.  How/when to wear:   The AMPHIBIA is an interesting piece. It is made well enough to be noticed in a casual setting since it does not look like a casual watch. You can certainly wear it to any outdoor activity, since that is what it is made for.      It goes well with earthy, rugged looks as well as anything leathery. It also touches up your everyday "Jeans and well fitting T-shirt"-Look. More noisy outfits tend to drown it out, as it never really clashes with anything. Although that might be different if you picked up one of the more colorful custom ones. If you want to give the watch a little more "oomph", you could go for a broad leather cuff or even a tacticool wristband.       I wear my Vostok everywhere with zero hesitations, since it just doesn't break. And even if I lost it - I can buy a new one without my bank account imploding. As someone who has the locksmith on speed dial, this is a relieving experience.     As for more formal occasions: While the AMPHIBIA goes well with a suit, there is a certain nonconformity in its simplicity. It is impossible to flash around. However, it radiates the quiet confidence of functionality and quality build. If I had to describe it, I'd say it is a lot like going to a suit and tie event, but being ripped underneath your shirt.   Bottomline:    I love it.   The VOSTOK AMPHIBIA is the watch for you if...   ... are a no-nonsense-kind-of-guy.   ... value functionality over flash.   ... would like to have nice looking watch without breaking the bank.   ... like cool pieces of history.    ... value unique things.
text:Also it was worn by Steve Zissou!  BTW saying it can go toe-to-toe with most top-tier watches is a huge boast. They usually come from the factory with +-30seconds a *day* lol, or worse. Not to mention sometimes a screw will come loose in the movement and you'll need to pop the case off to get it out and rescrew it in. Not to mention the bezel and bracelet they come with is raw sewage.   Don't get me wrong, they're great watches, I just spent 70$ modding mine with a display caseback, mesh bracelet, and bezel, but if you're going for quality at that price range, your best value will probably come from an homage like Pagani. You can get a sapphire crystal, display caseback, seiko movement watch on a decent enough bracelet from them for like 100$.	labels:Yeah, mine kept time like garbage. I miss the uniqueness of it though. It was a cool rig	episode_done:True

text:I dyed my leather boots and here is how it went.	labels:I‚Äôve been curious about leather dye for a while now - I‚Äôve used leather paint on a pair of heels I got for a dollar to turn their beige flakiness into a tidy(ish) pair of lilac heels. I didn‚Äôt wear them much as it was more of an experiment to see how good I could get the coverage and finish looking with a bad base. The paint was quite tacky and dried matte (think house paint) so I had to be careful with the application but coverage wasn‚Äôt as big an issue. However, I think wear would have been a problem long term as the paint adherence seemed a bit dodgy - if I scraped it I reckon it would have come right off, which doesn‚Äôt seem like it would be an issue with the dye. Appreciate the rundown... if I ever see something that would look good dyed darker I‚Äôll keep it in mind!
text:It's best to remove all the flakey bits first (hand sand it, usually), otherwise the paint layer is adhering to an unstable base.	labels:I did consider this, but the leather seemed to have some kind of coating to give it a smooth, lightly textured finish? I discovered that sanding it back gave way to a suede-like texture so instead I stuck to the problem areas with a light hand to try keep the original finish mostly intact. I was surprised as the shoes were originally quite expensive... but I definitely learned a lot about what to look for!	episode_done:True

text:The Business of Markups on Logo T-Shirts. Why You Shouldn't Drop $600 on a Gucci Tee	labels:I've been a bit of a T-shirt geek for about 50 years (seriously, ever since I started buying Grubb  and Hang Ten Ts in the 70s and parking lot tie-dies at Grateful Dead shows in the 80s and 90s) and by and large T shirts have gotten worse over time.  Oddly enough, because I needed some inexpensive shirts to trash while doing messy creative work I bought a bunch of Cabellas shirts for $7 each and they have been great.  A bit thin material wise but they haven't stretched, they hang really well, and they have lasted forever.    I have a friend that used to be a VP at a large footwear/apparel company and he and I have had conversations about T shirts.  It's all about what companies like Gucci can get away with, not the quality of the garment.  Economic signal theory at it's finest.
text:Totally agree about some of the old tshirts having great quality plus actually use some of the old fashioned methods valued today. A lot of the brands you hear about now (Lady White Co., McCoy's, etc) all use the old fashioned techniques but charging $100+ for a tee.  I think it's another reason why vintage tees (including just blanks) are so valued now.   I like Sunspel tees but even those guys have moved their construction to Portugal from England and I find that the quality has dropped over the years.	labels:What I really wish I had back are all the really interesting and beautifully executed silk screened Ts that populated the Dead world before the tie die thing hit.  There was some amazing art work on those shirts and the parking lot scene was capitalism at it's finest, there was fierce competition so people used really good blanks.  I still have bits of those shirts in my shop rag bin.	episode_done:True

It's an oxymoron to me, like have you got your legs out to stay cool or have you got the denim on to stay warm? What's going on here?

Plus they‚Äôre shorts/short sleeves which I prefer; I get too hot otherwise! They weren‚Äôt too expensive and I like that they look cute but are still really comfy to sleep in.	episode_done:True

text:This article is funny, but as a millenial who wears both trendy jeans *and* skinny jeans, I can confirm that no matter what I do the teens don't give a shit. Wear whatever you want; teens aren't gonna think you're cool either way. It's the natural order of things!	labels:This.  I'm 35.  I don't have to wear what TikTok thinks is hip.  (Not hating on TikTok.  I just remember when I was a teen and we saw moms trying to wear what their kids were wearing and it just looked kind of try-hard and tacky rather than hip.  And honestly I'm just as old now as those women were back then.  It's okay for fashion to have different ages and for us to age.)  Just because something isn't hip with the younger generation doesn't mean it isn't stylish either.  You can have a well-put together outfit that isn't the latest style and still look nice.  And you can incorporate some elements of newer, more fashionable styles to avoid looking dated without having to change your entire wardrobe.    That said I'm loving the resurgence of wide legged pants, especially in crop sizes.  They just look so much more fashionable and intentional to me rather than just a neutral like skinny jeans have sort of become.  So I can just pair them with a t-shirt and feel well dressed rather than dressed down.  In the summer they make me feel like I could put on a big hat and grab a tote bag and be at home at beach on the cape or something.	episode_done:True

text:what pieces/brands did you buy when moving from a warmer climate to a cooler climate? what did you end up regretting/not using?	labels:Okay, here's the super shitty part about DC: we have an incredibly wide range of weather and it makes no sense. Some examples:  1. This winter has been very mild so far and we haven't gotten any snow. A few years ago we had snow every week for like 8 weeks or something insane like that. 2. In the summer, sometimes it rains and the rain relieves the humidity for half the day and it's lovely. Sometimes, it gets even more humid after a summer rain, and you will be shocked that was even possible.  3. We have two lovely parts of the year wherein you're gonna need a winter jacket to leave the house in the morning, and then a tee shirt to go home in. We call these parts of the year 'spring' and 'fall' and they can have a 20 degree difference between morning and afternoon.  4. It rains here, a pretty decent amount. But sometimes, it's hot rain and sometimes it's cold rain. Either way, it rains a lot and you're gonna get soaked. A lot of people change shoes at the office for this reason.  Here are some items I recommend:  * Hunter boots (or other waterproof boots you can put liners into)- I like Hunter boots because everyone wears them in DC so you won't look out of place, they have *okay* traction control for snow (DC is pretty good about clearing and salting sidewalks), and the liners mean you can wear them year-round. * Cardigans of all shapes and sizes- extremely versatile and will save your ass when it's 40 degrees in the morning and 70 degrees in the afternoon. Easy to shove into a bag, too. I don;t focus on brand here, mostly just a variety of materials (wool for winter, cotton for summer) * A small, packable umbrella- I know the forecast doesn't call for rain, but trust me and keep this in your bag at all times. Spend money on this item, because it will pay for itself.  * A trench coat with a liner- like the boots, this will be something you can wear all year 'round. Bonus because you can remove the liner and shove it in your bag for the in-between days. I have one from [Brooks Brothers](https://www.brooksbrothers.com/Double-Breasted-Trench-Coat/WW00186,default,pd.html) that has lasted me years and is very versatile. Extra bonus, it's pretty good for the windy days we sometimes get.  * A waterproof, zippable bag- I personally use a [Longchamp](https://www.longchamp.com/us/en/products/shoulder-bag-s-L2605089545.html), which I'm not sure is officially waterproof, but it hasn't let me down yet.	episode_done:True
text:What's the greatest length you've gone to obtain a much coveted fashion item?	labels:Wow, some people here are very committed to getting things... and I think I'm equally as crazy. Except it's not that covetable of a fashion item? I had a thing for Twilight as a teen, and it was the mittens that Bella Swan wore. When I saw the mittens on the website, I was obsessed with that stitch on the palm. I couldn't afford to buy them new so I made my own sans the stitch, sparking my love for cables in knits. As in, knitting things with cables. I was 13 when I knitted them, I still have them. Fast forward like 10+ years and Ruth Cross stopped selling the mittens. She sold a pdf of the pattern. I bought it and knitted them and gave them to a friend. Around about the same time, someone listed a second hand pair for like USD$50. I bought them in an instant. I think they were like RRP$75USD so it wasn't like it was a great deal but it meant so much to me. It was the reason I learned how to knit in the first place.   I don't wear them! I just keep them for old memories sake. Oh, just maybe Bernie Sanders might bring mittens back in fashion.	episode_done:True

Some of their wool coats have [puffer built in](https://www.soiakyo.com/us/en/evette-classic-wool-coat-with-quilted-puffer-lining/EVETTE-C.html), which we can all agree is a rare and precious thing. **Note:** Neither Sosken or Soia & Kyo will keep you toasty like a Moncler or Canada Goose type down thing for the arctic, but they are perfect for bridging that gap between ‚Äústylish wool car coat‚Äù and ‚ÄúMichelin Man Snowsuit‚Äù weather.  - [Icebreaker thermals](https://www.icebreaker.com/en-us/womens-baselayers) - I hate spending money on thermals, and [Uniqlo‚Äôs Heattech line](https://www.uniqlo.com/us/en/women/heattech) is honestly good enough for almost everything. And then my husband took me ice fishing in Northern Minnesota and I spent the whole time wondering whether merely agreeing to go on the trip or marrying him in general was a terrible life decision but what was definitely not a terrible life decision was picking up some of these. They are the REAL DEAL for cold weather active wear and frequently much less expensive at sporting/outdoor stores, especially if you don‚Äôt care about things like color (which, honestly, they are thermals).  - [Wolford Merino Tights](https://www.wolfordshop.com/hosiery/tights/merino-tights/11310.html?nsctrid=v02_us_g_g_263083883451_&gclid=CjwKCAjw_Y_8BRBiEiwA5MCBJr3A0QTZPlipwI6nv57PtVz6mzSGvTjvESFkP05l4PjzKWhBS51NOBoCuPMQAvD_BwE) - like thermals, I hate spending money on tights. I ordered these black ones at $40 a piece from some European online sock store and hated every moment of it. Now it‚Äôs 3 years later and I am glad I spent the money. They are warm, slightly translucent so not frumpy like completely opaque tights can be, and unlike smartwool, they do not have the white ‚ÄúSmartwool‚Äù logo above the toe line so you can actually wear these with normal pumps in transitional weather. They also pilled less than smartwool. They are the only reason why I can continue to wear dresses and skirts to the office in the winter.  - [Love your melon](https://loveyourmelon.com/) - purveyors of the basic white girl beanie pom hats, or ‚Äútoques.‚Äù What I like about them is that they are thick knit and almost universally flattering. I have a huge head and typically beanies fit me like a condom but this one retains that slightly oversized effortlessly cozy look. Also 100% made in USA and Canada and 50% of their profits are donated to child cancer research. I have the speckled one and I love it.

text:General Discussion - December 13, 2020	labels:I hope nobody takes this comment as me being an asshole, because I‚Äôm intending this to be more of a constructive criticism than that.  But honestly, as someone whose style kind of stagnated somewhere in the mid 2010s, I kind of feel like this sub isn‚Äôt very helpful for updating my style, because the sub also refuses to catch up with what‚Äôs fashionable.  Like streetwear has obviously captured the zeitgeist for quite a while now. That‚Äôs always been an element of my wardrobe. But I feel like I could do better to expand my style and have more options and just in general better embrace trends and incorporate them into my own personal style.  But for the most part this sub isn‚Äôt really interested in keeping up. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm not expecting this sub to start going crazy for box logos or Supreme or dress like a futuristic cartoon character, if I was interested in that I would actually just read r/streetwear. But I do wish some of the recurring threads and users could offer some inspo in terms of tasteful, grown up streetwear outfits and things like that. But from my perception, MFA is still stuck in early 2010s menswear, J. Crew inspired Americana, or just outright standard business casual. Which is *fine*, it doesn‚Äôt look bad, but it‚Äôs certainly not fashionable anymore and despite that the default male fashion sub won‚Äôt look beyond it, largely.  EDIT: People have been asking me for examples, here‚Äôs some stuff that I‚Äôve liked lately, I don‚Äôt know that most or any of this is what you‚Äôd call ‚Äústreetwear‚Äù but it‚Äôs more in the direction of what I‚Äôm talking about   Thom Yorke is one of my consistently favorite style inspo sources, he pulls off a pretty good hybrid of tasteful streetwear and classic menswear style I think.  I like this kind of fit he‚Äôs worn a lot of the last couple years:   (Actually can‚Äôt find the exact pic I‚Äôm looking for here so I‚Äôll try my best here)  https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/theoaklandpress.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/1/4b/14bc5350-f6ff-11e8-8bd7-83eb124e2f8a/5c052f56b8ad2.image.jpg?resize=1200%2C800  Usually coupled with one of these Undercover jackets like this:  https://static.stereogum.com/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1161546807-1570042584-compressed.jpg  I think one of the pieces he wears a lot are the Acne Ryder pants, which I kind of like as hybrid classic menswear combined with a more informal, streetwear adjacent vibe:  https://www.nordstrom.com/s/acne-studios-ryder-slim-fit-pants/5146319  I also like Acne in general and I wish I could afford some of these jeans to work into some outfits I have kicking around in my head:  https://www.acnestudios.com/us/en/max-blue-black/B00146-AIL.html?categid=man-jeans  I also like Daniel Lopatin aka Oneohtrix Point Never‚Äôs style as well, who I‚Äôd say does kind of a more tasteful streetwear thing as well. This press pic is a nice example:  https://dazedimg-dazedgroup.netdna-ssl.com/1400/azure/dazed-prod/1230/9/1239834.jpg  More OPN with bonus Safdie brother: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DOn1aXWWsAAeZSC.jpg  I also like these black denim jackets, chore jackets kind of thing. I have a good Rag & Bone one that I‚Äôve gained too much weight to wear, but these 3sixteen and Rogue Territory ones are nice too and along those lines:  https://www.3sixteen.com/collections/outerwear/products/type-3s-denim-jacket-lightweight-double-black   https://www.rogueterritory.com/collections/jackets/products/supply-jacket-stealth-black?variant=5415637057568  Also along these lines, this Carhartt WIP jacket: https://stagprovisions.com/collections/carhartt-wip/products/carhartt-wip-modular-jacket-ss18  In general I like the use of black/muted or monochromatic colors, I like the idea of drawing influence from punk/hardcore style because I‚Äôm into that as well, but I haven‚Äôt figured out exactly how to make that work. Also for that reason, I‚Äôd like to replace my Red Wings with a pair of Docs, I like the rougher around the edges style better.  I‚Äôm gonna trying to keep editing this post, Reddit is kinda fucking up on my phone.

Even if you buy 3 pairs on zenni and dislike 2 of them, you now have 2 backup glasses (or you can return them), and you've just saved at least 210$.

text:Does anyone else have this style issue?	labels:I definitely feel this. I have a large butt/hips and do often find that they impact the shape of silhouettes that I'm trying to wear. I'm very inspired by menswear as well and dress fairly androgynously. I tend to modify menswear silhouettes slightly so that I can achieve something similar. I personally feel much better in high waisted pants with a tucked in shirt/sweater - somehow I feel like it emphasizes my lower body less and gives me a sleeker line from top to bottom, so when I'm drawing influence from menswear I tend to modify it with a higher waistline. I also make sure that I'm defining my upper body with tops that are more structured around the shoulder. Drop shoulders don't play well with me.  I find with these tweaks I'm able to both find a nice balance where I don't feel like I'm fighting against my body and I'm also able to invoke more masculine references and play with most silhouettes I like. Although it did take me a lot of trial and error to figure out it out.	episode_done:True
text:What are some habits that keep clothes/shoes new vs that habits that ruin them?	labels:I just want to say that this thread is what we should point to when someone is like "I'm young (or not young) and don't have a lot of money but I want to do a sustainable wardrobe, help!"  We've been sold the American idea that sustainability is about shopping and sure, that's one angle, but only one.  So much of it is about what you do and skills you can build.  Invest some time in learning laundry, care and repair techniques, its free to learn.  Then the stuff you love lasts longer, wallet is happier, "investment pieces" become more attainable since you can trust yourself to have nice things, less eco impact, and a partridge in a pear tree.  Things I wish I knew 20 years ago:  I used to never care for shoes or polish them or anything. They would sort of wear out at a certain point and I thought that was that. I didnt know you could resole shoes, or maybe I had some vague notion but a shoe repair place seemed kind of intimidating or maybe just for guys in business suits and wingtips. Then I learned to clean and polish them regularly, and resole my good pairs every two years or so and OMG.  They last so much longer, look so much better, and I learned that the polish keeps the actual shoe protected from dust and debris etc so if I polish regularly I keep that stuff off the actual shoe.  I also learned that you can get almost much any stain out if you run it under cool water immediately, before it starts to set.  Blood, wine, paint, etc.  Likewise oil, grab a little dish detergent or hand soap or whatever you can access and gently handwash that sucker before it sets in.  Prevents having to do a lot of heavy lifting with stain removers later.
text:I literally have to travel an hour to the only place that does shoe repairs that I know of. And if you're resoling several pairs of shoes every couple years.... those shoes aren't "lasting." It's harder today to find quality items. I have a pair of leather boots that are literally 15 years old and I wear them every winter and have never touched them with any product. The stitching is still good and yes the sole is flat but still not worn through.	labels:Eh. I'm in NYC and commute by public transit, snd often walk a few miles per day in all weather.  I own a small number of shoes, and moreover I have flat feet and wear orthotics, so its important the soles are even.  You want to walk around with 15 year old flattened out soles tho, you do you.	episode_done:True
text:How do you dress for the (extreme) weather where you're from?	labels:Chicago here- Kenny from South Park, except in purple.
text:Help me. I moved to Chicago this summer and have not been able to figure out coats. Went to Macy's and they had nothing long, which I've been told is a must. And the coats they DID have weren't temperature rated so I had no idea if they were sufficient. So I bought nothing...  Signed,  Girl from FL/SC	labels:I'm here to help!! Chicago winter is all about layers and the right coat and boots. You've got some time- summer seems to be running long this year. It's probably just superstition, but I like to build up to my long coat and hold off on wearing it as long as possible, so it feels warmer when I finally get to it. The wind kind of amplifies the cold here, so be aware if you're close to the lake that it'll feel colder.  &#x200B;  * Coat- [Moosejaw](https://www.moosejaw.com/product/outdoor-research-women-s-coze-down-parka_10493603) is a good place to get good brands of down coats without spending too much. LL Bean is good too. Canada Goose is the uniform of Chicago girls but too rich for my blood. The coat should be at least knee length (I linked to a potential option on moosejaw) and should have a hood. If it's got fleece lining at the cuffs, all the better. * Gloves- I usually go to nordstrom rack or TJ maxx and grab a bunch of cheap pairs so I can always keep one on me.  * Hats- same as gloves for where to get them. Can't underestimate a good beanie to keep your ears warm. * Boots- I use LL bean duck boots. They're easy and waterproof which is superhelpful when the temperature swings and it gets all slushy. * Socks- nordstrom rack or uniqlo. Get socks designed for the cold! Wool or a tech fabric. Your normal socks won't keep your toes warm. * Finally, Uniqlo is your best friend. There's one on Michigan across from the hancock tower and I think one on state street? Heattech leggings, socks, and shirts will seriously keep you warm when it's painfully cold out. They're also good for layers- I love their down vests.   Overall, layer layer layer. Especially in older buildings with radiator heat, it can be really warm when you get inside, so you want to be able to switch back and forth between warm and cold! And seriously, don't worry at all about being cute- when winter hits, we're all trolls together here. Feel free to reach out over DM with any other chicago questions!	episode_done:True
text:Anyone have a job that requires you to wear "work clothes" (nursing, trades, etc.)? What is your off-duty wardrobe like?	labels:I ride horses professionally and manage a boarding facility, so my daily wear has to be appropriate for riding 8 horses a day (so breeches, knee high socks, athletic shirts), getting dirty (mud boots, overclothes I don't much care about), and staying warm/dry (seven billion layers of hobo coats). Unfortunately, my personal style is more of a mix of cottagecore/Edwardian/grungy Audrey Hepburn, which as you can imagine has absolutely no place whatsoever in my day to day life. I am also a compulsive clothes hoarder (screw you, Goodwill and thrift shopping!)  &#x200B;  I got sick and tired of seeing all these beautiful clothes in my closets that I *never* wore, so I purged it completely. I have two to three outfits for every occasion, two pairs of going - out jeans, and one pair of black heels now, with the ability to mix and match in between. Since I never really go anywhere, I always feel like I'm wearing something new when I do! Most of my pieces are more or less "timeless styles," and then I try and get one new thing every season to keep my wardrobe up with the times. But I have a rule that every time I buy a new thing, I have to throw one item out, which helps with the clothes hoarding!   &#x200B;  Luckily, I have some room for fashion in my work wear. I try and get trendy colored breeches in earth tones, find complementary shirts and jackets, cool socks, etc. I also have the awesome opportunity to color coordinate with my horse *and* his tack, which most people can't say, so I'll take that over being truly fashionable any day! (Did you guys know it's actually pretty difficult to pick a color scheme that also complements the exact shade of your horses coat properly? It's hard enough to determine whether humans are cool or warm or whatever....)	episode_done:True

text:What are some differences between stereotypical Millennial and Gen Z fashion/aesthetics?	labels:As a gen z person, I associate things like cardigans and oversized sweaters and leggings and stuff like that with millennials, while gen z is more into crop tops and baggy jeans, but there is some overlap between the generations styles. I think something that makes a big difference is that  most millennials have jobs, so they can‚Äôt exactly fill their wardrobe with tube tops and less practical clothing.	episode_done:True
text:Overdressing - Discussion	labels:I think there are some job interview situations where being really over dressed leaves a bad impression. For example, at an interview with a small non-profit that deals with homelessness, showing up in Louboutins and an obviously very pricy bag may give the impression that you don't know how to read the room, or are unfamiliar with the typical organizational culture of non-profits.
text:I used to work in startups and it was not great when candidates showed up in full suits. Candidates were told that it was a laid back environment and to wear business casual at most for interviews. I felt awkward interviewing people who were much more dressed up than me, not to mention that their clothes suggested that they wouldn't be a good culture fit.  I also showed up to an interview once wearing heels that were totally appropriate for walking around an office, not realizing that my interview was going to involve about 2 miles of walking across a huge corporate campus. In this case recruiting told me to "wear whatever I felt comfortable in" so I went with a skirt, cardigan, and knee-high boots, thinking that it would be a cute, put-together look without looking too formal. At one point my interviewer looked at my feet and said, "those aren't really great shoes for this interview and you're way overdressed. Didn't recruiting tell you that we're a casual workplace?" Needless to say, I didn't get the job.	labels:I went to an interview at a casual retail store. I was wearing black cigarette pants and a button up shirt and some loafers. The manager had the interview on the stoop of a brownstone around the corner, then at the end told me I was way overdressed for their ‚Äúcasual vibes‚Äù and did not get the job.   I guess you could say I didn‚Äôt ‚Äúread the room‚Äù enough beforehand but also I feel like it is rude to have your interview on someone else‚Äôs property. It was weird because the residents came home and were asking us to get off their stairs.. I find being so ‚Äúlow key‚Äù to not have a remotely proper interview space planned is disrespectful to the interviewee.

text:Tall beauties of Reddit, tell me your favorite brands that offer tall/long options	labels:Hello!! I have STRUGGLED so much finding jeans that work for me (curvy and 5‚Äô11, brands seem to not believe we exist) that I want to recommend madewell. A bit on the pricier side but they actually have tall and super tall (I think) inseams. Their sizing is a bit weird though, I think I went down two sizes from the size I thought I was so I‚Äôd recommend going to a store to try on before buying. Another brand with tall sizing is Banana Republic, I have a pair of jeans I love from there but they are almost too short for me so they may not work for your niece but might for some others!   Lululemon has tall length leggings but again those are pricy. I don‚Äôt usually mind short leggings anymore since 7/8 length has came into style (thank goodness)  Tops and jackets are hardest for me, I haven‚Äôt found a brand that consistently makes long enough arms yet. One trick I‚Äôve found though is that if a top has thumb holes, you can sew those up and it fits like a regular long sleeve!   Also partially commenting because I‚Äôd love to see what everyone else has to add!
text:YMMV with Madewell. I love the brand for many of their tops and accessories, but I despise the quality of their jeans. And as someone who is ‚Äúonly‚Äù 5‚Äô9‚Äù but has a short torso / long legs, their dresses, shorts, and non-denim pants don‚Äôt come in taller lengths and always look ridiculously short on me.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What fashion trend/s have you been obsessed with lately?	labels:I love so many things on your list.

I love the clothes but I don‚Äôt really connect to that as nostalgia (not my past). Modern takes on Chinese hanfu are very appealing in contrast    desaturated athleisure sets  * I‚Äôm behind the times here as I think matching desaturated colors (olive green, camel, ivory, pale blue) was really a 2019 trend but whatever. I grabbed like 4 outdoor voices techsweat sets at start of quarantine and have been living in them.   * Depending on how they last I‚Äôll either double down on the brand or swap to the next one in 2021 (Lulu aligns?) * fav combo is crop top + leggings + approx match sweatshirt I can get away with on professional zoom  * matching scrunchie or headband of course	episode_done:True
text:When is a garment worth it to you?	labels:It's hard to quantify this and I'm probably in the minority but:  When it comes to clothing, I don't think about it in such logical way to begin with. I don't look at timelessness, I don't focus on quality too much as long as it's at the suitable level for the purpose of the item.  I always carry an image of myself, and how I want to look in clothes that I own. When I see a piece that I feel would work really good with that image, that's when I 'want' an item. The image of myself that I carry in my head always changes, so that's why I don't worry about timelessness. Why would I give a shit about timelessness when my own ideal image of myself changes all the time?  So in essense my clothing purchases will always be 'impulse purchase' in nature. The only difference is whether I decide that the item itself will last itself to sale price, in which case I wait, or if I think it will be sold out, in which case I usually pull the trigger.
text:I agree, Im so over the timelessness thing‚Äî and I dont think its true‚Äî cuts change, proportions change‚Äî I dont think much in terms of clothes is actually timeless	labels:The older I get, it feels like the opposite. The majority of trends seem to come and go long before I notice or understand them (so why bother buying them to discard a year later) while a few properly fitting/well tailored staples seem to always work.	episode_done:True
text:Does the way you dress really have to have a label for it??	labels:No. I wear what I want and all together what happens is what happens. An outfit can be in a specific style but I think very few people actually stick to one aesthetic in everything they wear. Sometimes different vibes suit different days, and it's nice to have a dress for a goth day and another for a soft pastel floral day. Just do what makes you happy.	episode_done:True
text:How to Talk About Collared Shirts	labels:Brilliant guide, must have taken a lot of work to put it together so thanks for all the effort you've gone to.  Would it be worth a mention on sloped shoulders?  I went through loads of brands and fits (even custom) because every shirt I wore would fit well in most areas, but I would always be left with big diagonal creases from my collarbone.  It was only the last custom company I found, asked me if I had sloped shoulders.  Turns out they are quite severely sloped which was the cause of all my issues.  Nice to see wool mentioned as a material, its not very common but is brilliant for shirts.  My mum found a Ralph lauren Polo shirt on sale in a department store about 7 years ago, it was reduced to ¬£15 so she just bought it.  It was originally for my dad but was too small so I got it instead.  It's pure wool, heavy, but feels like silk and breathes brilliantly.  The fit is perfect and it never needs ironing.  Only problem I have now is that I've worn it so much that the button holes aren't as secure.  I've added a bit of weight too so they are prone to popping open when I sit/stand!	episode_done:True
text:General Discussion - December 01, 2020	labels:Been doing some more research into rings and other jewelry that I'd like. The more accessible/conventionally available options tend have a lot of biker and celtic designs, but that doesn't speak to me as much as Japanese designs. Read Die, Workwear's article on [Kei Shigenaga](https://dieworkwear.com/2020/01/23/kintsugi-the-japanese-art-of-repair/) and found a smaller Japanese brand called [Noh](https://theunconventional.co.uk/menswear/designers/noh.html) that's got similar designs. Anyone know any others?  Of course I also happen to have very slender fingers so finding something I like aesthetically that fits well is another difficulty too. Guess I'm just gonna have to cough up the cash to get what I want, no avoiding it really
text:You've probably found this brand already, but I really like Miansai's stuff.  They're not all homeruns but most of their pieces are pretty minimal and I find them easy to incorporate into a variety of outfits.  Not quite at the craftsmanship level of the Japanese stuff, of course.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone invest in real jewelry?	labels:I find that no matter how much jewelry I have, I usually just lean towards a few pairs of earrings and a few rings, and perhaps a necklace and bracelet here and there. I invest in pieces that are unique, fit with my personal style, and are made of good quality materials (imo this includes metals like copper which I think is so lovely with my skin tone). The silver rings I have are from vintage or resale and that's 100% the way to go if you enjoy unique and special pieces and don't want to spend a fortune. I have about 5 pairs of earrings, all handmade. Of the two that are staples for me, One is from Mocahete on etsy, and one is from Silvias Creations on etsy. At the end of the day, you can only wear so much jewelry at one time...I never purchase jewelry that's not well made with quality materials (because the look of that type is just so much better)....but I certainly don't spend a fortune either	episode_done:True
text:Three brands only for the rest of your life. What‚Äôs yours and why?	labels:Kent Wang has some basics, some footwear, and an insanely large range of MTM options for formalwear, outerwear, et cetera. I'd consider Spier, too, but they don't   Asket has basics that fit me well, and in the casual range.  The hardest thing will be limiting myself on the interesting front. I'm really not sure what I'd pick there. I haven't had enough time to explore interesting menswear. Maybe Yeossal or their Safari jackets, drawstring pants, one piece polos, and cool shoes, and a lot of that available in MTM options. The Armoury would be good if I could pick a store, that would cover a lot of collabs, but they ain't cheap.	episode_done:True
text:Has consulting a stylist really been a revelation to you?	labels:Another big Thank You for all your answers! I will post an update as soon as my appointment is done. I‚Äôm sorry that I cannot help you personally with finding a stylist since we all live in different regions.   However, I recommend it that you do it just like me: research all the stylists in your area, compare the prices, see if the layout of their website is appealing to you and of course look out for reviews. The most important thing however is to get in personal contact with the stylist. I called mine three times and she was so friendly and made compromises to meet my needs. The appointment is all about you so I would watch out for the overall costumer service.   Again, I will post an update after the appointment at the end of December. üòä	episode_done:True

I only ever smell it in passing and have never had the chance to ask someone what they‚Äôre wearing. It‚Äôs a sweet but not too sweet, like a dry sweetness., cottony, clean linen, and powdery almost like a powder poof from back in the day.  Sounds insane, I know, but I would recognize it anywhere.

text:A ring coat would probably fit you pretty well given how they're constructed, and you can pick second hand ones up fairly cheap from Japan and resell for profit if it doesn't work. I've seen them drop to about $100 on YJP.   The sizing on them is odd, I'd look at sleeve length/body length over other things. The waist is huge, and it has tie adjusters to bring it in. I wear a size 2 / M in most kapital upper body stuff, and I reckon I could comfortably get two of me in the waist of my long ring coat and could probably wear a size 1 if it weren't for sleeve length issues.   I also think they look better a bit longer fwiw.   Second hand Yohji might be worth looking at too?	labels:	episode_done:True

It was cool then and it's cool now. And RL has infiltrated all sorts of cultures, namely hip hop and streetwear meaning the demand for it isn't just bankers. And RL has been a titan of American fashion in that he sort of figured out his formulas a while ago and hasn't changed that much. RL from the past is just as recognizable as RL from today. In my opinion it's aged unbelievably well. Old RL pieces are like darling Americana that can styled with anything. An old RL knit hangs just as well with streetwear as it does with jeans and boots. And while similar brands like BB are nice, they are one trick ponies. RL has and continues to offer an expansive product line from tech skiwear to western clothes. I think this huge line up means that even if there are duds, they are hidden by the massive catalog of hit pieces like the bear line up.
text:I think at its best, RL pulls from all the great American heritage brands:   * Prep outdoors brands like Ll Bean or Woolrich * American Trad like Brooks Bros * Western brands like Pendleton or Levi‚Äôs   And finds a way to blend them and tweak them in such correct but interesting ways.   Ralph is the ultimate Americana guy, he just gets the genre. Very Ralph is a great doc too.	labels:	episode_done:True

I finally caved and bought them after waffling between Blundstones and Redbacks for a while, but after trying them both on, I sent the Blundstones back. The Redbacks are actually made in Australia, have thicker leather uppers, a cushier footbed, and are cheaper.

I tend to stick to light, shimmery, pink-champagne-white tones for shadow and generally rock a nude lip unless I‚Äôm feeling spicy.

text:Are LBD‚Äôs really a MUST?	labels:Wow! Thanks for the insight - I don‚Äôt think I will be buying a dress (or having an occasion where I need it) anytime soon. None of the black dresses I see spark joy and excitement.   As a lot of people have noted, I am at a stage in life where I haven‚Äôt really narrowed down my options career and lifestyle wise so investing in a black dress might not be worth it for me.   I am in sciences, and my field of science requires a lot of lab work and presentations. I am also having a black heel dilemma- everyone says you need one, but I like being able to ‚Äúrun‚Äù everywhere. I am also afraid that in interviews to these STEM jobs interviewers may perceive me as being impractical for wearing heels instead of flatter, easier to walk shoes for interviews. I know I am definitely wearing pants because  they make me feel the most comfortable.
text:Cole Haan loafers are where it's AT. They have flat ones and ones with a slight heel, all colors, all super comfortable. If you're going to invest in anything, I'd recommend investing in quality shoes now before your feet are too fucked to wear cute shoes even for a short time.  \-Sincerely, a 31-year-old with a sprained toe from wearing heels for 12 hours... 11 months ago.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Is it disgusting to not wear socks with shoes?	labels:I think she's the one who has the problem. Dodged a bullet there. No show socks are an option but I don't see why it's bad to wear shoes with no socks. I wouldn't wear dress shoes with no socks, but I have no problem wearing some sneakers, boat shoes or loafers with no socks. With your vans, you can just toss them in the washer to get them clean if they start to smell (no dryer though!). If you don't want to wear no show socks you can look into foot powder to keep your shoes fresh and absorb the moisture from your feet. Gold bond works	episode_done:True
text:advice on how to stop buying clothes I don't need?	labels:I started sewing! I found a dress I really loved and instead of buying it I made it myself. I spent $14 on the fabric and spent 3 days making it, versus spending $100 on the dress. I found it keeps my hands busy and off my phone so I can't do online shopping. I've also developed a lot of skills to match some of the clothes I see that I love.

I have a weakness for cute, novelty, highly-specific shoes, the ones that are always on sale or clearance (for a reason), but barely getting dressed this year meant most of my shoes didn't make sense for my taking-out-the-trash-in-leggings-outfits. So I swallowed my basic-bitch pride and jumped on the bandwagon and now I see the light! UGGs and Teva's, here I come!  **Worst:** All the dresses purchased early on in anticipation of many (now cancelled) weddings this year, and anything that didn't fit right the first time I tried it on. I finally busted out the sewing machine in quarantine this year but realized that beyond some basic hemming, I'm not really down for legit alterations, as evidenced by my pile of "work-in-progress" clothes that I've already spent too many hours trying to salvage, some of which have since transferred to the donation pile...

text:Does anyone have a "uniform"?	labels:My husband and I both do a version of this - for him, he has several long sleeve mockneck Upf shirts with no logos on them from REI as casual wear.

text:People who used to play super safe with fashion, how did you overcome your fear of bold choices?	labels:Baby steps. Try a style of garment you already wear regularly but in a color or pattern that you‚Äôve never tried before. Stock up on cheap costume jewelry and always be trying new combinations of accessories.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else have this style issue?	labels:Have you ever considered your body is great, just the cut of the garment is whack?  This is the correct answer, by the way.  Your body is fine how it is, however you want to drape it, or whatever your health or fitness goals may be.  It sounds like you may not have a strong grasp on how the fashion industry works.  Clothing manufacture is based off a pattern and a fit model.  If the fit model does not share your attributes or proportions, the garment will be off for you.  If you do, in fact, have wider hips/bottom, then 1950's femme styles should be on point for you. (I know you are looking for menswear, just sayin'.)  The New Look was based around a dramatic waist to hip ration. It was a dark time for apple shapes. Perhaps you are buying too  small, or the waist is too long or short for you-- i.e. the garment is hitting you in the wrong place.  If you have a hard to fit body (I have a very difficult to fit shape), learning to sew or finding a seamstress will make light work of getting things to fit precisely.  If you have no interest in that, find brands that use simmilar size and proportions in their patterns and fit models. For you, the first thing I think of is the brand Unique Vintage.  All their fit models have larger hips/bums, smaller waists, and long waists in their garments.  Mod Cloth and Collectif will fit your proportions as well.  For gender neutral stuff I can NOT recommend Bindle and Keep enough: [https://www.bindleandkeep.com](https://www.bindleandkeep.com/pricing-packages)  These folks are the GOAT at making a suit for all bodies. J'adore.  I, who am very shortwaisted, have found Talbots petites is an almost exact match for my proportions, and can buy anything off the rack or internet in my size and know how it will fit.  The bad news: it is trial and error.  It is a process. Like, a long process.  There is nothing wrong with you.  There are just thousands of brands and manufacturers, all with slight variations.  Have fun finding the ones that work for you!  The other thing if you are starting out on your fashion journey is to look up kibbe body typing (kind of out of date but whatevs) and use [this tool:](https://themedian.moda/) to find your size twin on social media and see how they do.  Have fun!  Do you have an album of pics of the look you are going for?	episode_done:True

I wear jeans + black tops, almost exclusively, because I feel most comfortable that way and it's a kind of uniform derived from the protests of the 60s and 70s. Still, it takes time for others to get over my blonde, blue eyed, slim tall markers to engage with the real me. Not any hardship.

text:Do you: 1) keep all of your wardrobe equally diverse, or 2) keep all of your wardrobe minimal, or 3) keep some pieces relatively similar while diversifying others?	labels:Most of my wardrobe is similarly diverse in shape and color, but there are areas of my wardrobe which lean to more color (shirts, dresses), and others that are almost completely neutral (pants, shoes, jackets). I think this is partially due to the cost of those items, and the number that I have; shoes/jackets are more expensive, and I need to have different types for the different types of weather where I live, but shirts are less expensive, and I can wear them in almost every season. I can relate to the desire to buy multiples, but I would caution against buying too many of an item before you've thoroughly tested it (worn in different seasons, washed multiple times), since there can be an irritating flaw that is not immediately obvious. Also, sometimes if you bring in a new item, (I recently bought a pair of higher top sneakers, and many of my pant lengths are like 1 inch too long- so I need to fold the leg under an inch since a 1/2 inch cuff looks stupid), it can be difficult to pair if everything else is similar.	episode_done:True

Sometimes even those client meetings turn into tramping around a few acres  I‚Äôm looking for some recommendations on pants and nicer looking shoes/boots that balance performance and looking like he gave a shit that day.   He prefers pants with some elastic in the waist due to some GI issues that lead to weight fluctuation so I was looking at something like the Prana Brion pant but they seem to be having some quality issues lately.

text:People who've been working from home for most of 2020 - do you think your work style will change when you go back to the office (compared to your work wardrobe pre-lockdown)? If so, how?	labels:Like some other folks, I've realized during these times that I definitely don't dress for myself, so I'll probably overcompensate once I return to the public. I also colored my hair for the first time and got a second ear piercing and have generally been feeling the itch to shake things up and have more fun with my style relative to status quo which was a little more basic and low-maintenance for work.   I've also considered how my commute might change with a potentially reduced in-office schedule (and tbh I've debated when I might feel comfortable returning to public transit) and how that would affect my wardrobe choices. I used to feel somewhat limited as footwear and outerwear had to be practical for walking/waiting for buses outdoors (which in the PNW means basically only raincoat + boots 7 months of the year, plus weather 30 degrees colder in the morning than afternoon). I imagine more flexible in-person hours and commuting by car would allow for way more variety in that department!	episode_done:True

That said, I've found lightening up the hairstyling and makeup is quite helpful if you want to look more relaxed.  I also have a personal rule about shoes and skirts: the higher the hemline, the less sexy the shoe. This keeps miniskirts looking relaxed, and prevents longer skirts from skewing frumpy. Obviously rules are meant to be broken, including this one, and it doesn't really apply in the evening.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 15, 2020	labels:So I bought these new pair of khakis from H&M and they were a little bit looser than an exact pair I bought from a year ago, my body shape did not change. I thought I had gotten my fit to a tee, now It‚Äôs back to the guessing game. Fortunately, my dryer shrank the pants down so it‚Äôs all good. Can anyone explain this? The pair of chinos I bought was skinny fit stretch chinos.
text:H&M change their fits and their fabric often, and not all of their clothes are always made in the same factory so things (even the same model in the same year) aren't always going to be identical.   To put it another way, it's impossible to make thousands of copies of a single pattern identical. The fabric might shrink differently, it might get cut slightly differently, a few fractions of a mm difference in the sewing will make a difference etc etc etc.  If you have something you like the fit of, and another item that's a bit bigger you can always get the bigger one tailored to match.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Have you ever gone out on a limb and bought clothing from an unknown brand advertised on Instagram/Facebook/online?

The owner is an awesome, hilarious, relatable person- I've actually had several non-purchase related conversations with her.   I came across it when she'd posted a tank top in her shop- she typically does all the modeling herself. She wasn't wearing a bra and some people wanted to come in and be assholes. She fucking HANDLED them. They should not have come for her, lol.   Her aesthetic is "irreverent woman" and I think she represents it well. If I had more money, I'd have bought a lot more of her stuff.	episode_done:True
text:What did people *actually* wear in 2000's?	labels:From 2001-2005, clothing I wore as a high schooler/college kid: low rise bootcut jeans, fitted graphic tshirts, fitted polo shirts, fitted shirts in general (shirts were so tight- maybe that‚Äôs why we layered??), always layering shirts- and shirts were super long and over your hips, but tight- never tucking them in, cutoff denim skirts, cotton shorts (like soffees) with words on the butt, necklace with my first initial on it, platform flip flops, dresses with Hawaiian prints (like flowers or surfers etc), hoop earrings, fitted hoodies. That‚Äôs what I can remember.
text:> fitted graphic tshirts  does anyone else remember the trend from 2002-2005 or so where all the graphic tee shirts had fake businesses on them, with logos and slogans and illustrations and everything like one would a real ad? i saw it a handful of places but remember it most vividly from abercrombie and comparable stores at the time like hollister & aeropostale.

text:What do YOU do with "chub rub" jeans?	labels:So, I'm a personal stylist that specializes in fitting women's denim. In my experience, the useable lifespan of a pair of jeans is about 2 years. Some will hold up longer than that (usually the higher the cotton amount, the longer they will last), but when you're talking middle-of-the-road quality with blended fabric, the two year mark is where you'll start to see warping, color fade, stress on the hardware, but most tragically, crotch breakdown. And this is across the board for women of all shapes and sizes. It's just that the area is subject to constant friction but a lot of my clients worry that it's due to their shape. It's not.  As I mentioned above, probably the best defense is shopping for denim that has a higher cotton percentage, like 98% or more. I have two pairs of 100% cotton vintage Levi's that are 35 and 25 years old respectively with no crotch wear. The caveat is the more cotton content, the less your jeans will stretch. They will mold to your body... but they will not stretch. And you're limited in styles. There aren't really any 100% cotton skinny jeans, at least none that work well for most people so you're kind of limited to that mom/boyfriend/straight style fit.  The second thing you can do is be gentle in caring for your jeans. There are some diehards who never wash their denim. This is a little silly when you're talking non-raw or non-selvedge denim. Please wash your jeans. But I recommend getting a gentle detergent (woolite), do not use fabric softener (actually you shouldn't use it period), wash on cold, gentle cycle inside out, and hang to dry. This is especially important if you are dealing with blended fabric since the stretch fibers will break down when exposed to heat. I recommend washing every 5 or so wears. If you need to freshen up between washes you can toss them in the dryer on low with a handful of ice cubes and a dryer sheet for 15 minutes or until the ice stops rattling. This shouldn't be too damaging since you're not drying saturated fabric for 45+ minutes but it will reset the shape (especially for stretch jeans that are starting to warp and/or sag) and knock out any smell.  For repair, the sooner you address a hole the better. You may be able to self-patch up a hole that's smaller than two fingers through it. If you're crafty, get out the sewing machine and sew what you can. A quick YouTube search will turn up tutorials that are better than anything I could attempt to describe here. You could also patch from the inside and sew everything closed with a little reinforcement. But if the surrounding fabric is starting to degrade or if the hole is big and/or in a conspicuous spot, you really only have one option other than retiring those jeans.  In terms of repair beyond two fingers, the best way to do it for a pair of jeans that you CANNOT bear to part with is to send them to be rewoven. I only know of [one company that does this well](https://www.denimrepair.com/) but it's not exactly cheap ($45 + shipping) so I would really evaluate any denim that you get re-woven. In 20 years I've only had 2 pairs re-woven. It also only really buys you a few more months with stretch denim, maybe a year or two with a higher cotton count. With blended denim, it may just be best to total them. Give them a viking funeral.  All in all, I think your best bet is to just sort of accept that most of your jeans will only last about 2 years. Oh, and when they stop fitting correctly, don't be so hard on yourselves. A lot of the time, jeans will stop fitting because their fabric is warping from being worn and washed. A good way to find jeans that fit is to look based on your height (which will tell you inseam and rise, first and foremost). Most women don't know what their height translates to in terms of those measurements though even though this is one of the biggest reason jeans "don't fit." [This has helped me sort out jeans that will fit in the length and rise for a client.](https://project-fit-mvp.herokuapp.com/) Then I just need to find something they'll like and select their size. It's not pretty but it does like 90% of my styling job by only showing stuff that's going to fit.
text:Another way to go longer between washes is to use a vodka spray to disinfect and freshen up your jeans. I learned it from working in film, it‚Äôs called Russian mix and is 1 part vodka (cheap stuff!) 4 parts water and at least a few drops of your preferred essential oil. Something fresh like eucalyptus or pine works great. Shake it up in a spray bottle and you‚Äôve got an easy way to kill odour causing bacteria on clothes.	labels:You can do this with vinegar too.	episode_done:True

text:PSA: Revive by Rent the Runway via Thredup	labels:I would highly recommend against it. I love thredup and purchase from there often, I have loved Rent The Runway in the past. But if you've ever bought an item from a RTR sample sale (which are usually much more reasonably priced than they are on ThredUp currently) you'll know that it's a total dice roll on whether or not the item you're getting will be trashed. ThredUp doesn't have a great return policy, and you can't request additional pictures from the seller like you could on a direct sales site like depop or poshmark.

text:How do you know if a piece of clothing is worth its price?	labels:‚ÄúWort it‚Äù is entirely subjective. For some people worth it means it‚Äôs trendy/stylish, for some people it means high quality materials, for some people it means fit, etc.  *Personally* , worth it normally means either:  * higher quality materials, good construction, and a staple item for my wardrobe that I will wear a lot even if it costs a bit more. For example, I‚Äôll spend more on a trench coat I‚Äôll wear for years or really well fitting jeans.  OR   * Trendy or something I won‚Äôt wear often, but not expensive. For example, I won‚Äôt spend more than $20 or $30 on a ‚Äútrendy‚Äù top I won‚Äôt wear often or will likely be out fashion soon like something with cold shoulders or lots of ruffles. Same for something that‚Äôs a really bright color and I likely won‚Äôt wear often.  I‚Äôve also learned no matter what, fit is really important. Things do not need to be expensive to fit well, I‚Äôve had plenty of F21 or H&M items that fit perfectly! Realistically this is the most important fact that makes an item ‚Äúworth it‚Äù because if something fits poorly at the end of the day I‚Äôll never actually wear it.	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - January 02, 2021	labels:I'm proud to say that I was successful completing my new year's resolution from 2020 of not purchasing any new clothing. I had made the exception of new socks and underwear, but I purchased a bunch at the end of 2019 and they managed to last me for the year.   I chose the goal initially to try and cut down on my waste. I'm a very impulsive person who makes very impulsive purchases and a lot of what I was buying was going practically untouched. I had also seen the patriot act episode regarding fast fashion and that was the final nail in the coffin. The beginning was the hardest‚Äîespecially once the spring/summer sales started. I found that after a couple of days I'd forget about the sale and eventually I stopped even looking at clothes online and hunting for sales.  The effects from the resolution carried over to other aspects of my life. I found I was more conscientious of other products I was buying. I spent time researching environmental effects and labour practices of all sorts of different companies. I have been a lot more mindful of where my money is being spent. I cancelled my amazon prime subscription and have opted to shop locally as much as possible, but if not, spending my money at small independent online retailers.   At Christmas I did purchased my dad a new Reigning Champ sweater from NRML, an independent store in Ottawa. I made this exception  because it sets up my 2021 resolution‚Äîthe only new clothes I can buy are slow made, or made in Canada/USA. I think this embodies the spirit of my 2020 resolution but doesn't restrict me from supporting smaller designers.

text:How many clothes do you have? (Really?)	labels:10 ish tshirts, 10 ish tank tops, i use both for work and workouts, so dual purpose.

Work trousers = 3 at the moment, not counting 2 pairs in the mending that are unwearable at the moment.  1 is in terrible shape, i'll probably convert that one to weekend shorts.  Weekend shorts = 5 pairs of varying appropriateness for anything from lying around the house, to chores, to a night of dancing, to movie night at friends'.  Fancy shirts for dancing/first dates: ~5.  1 bin of undershirts/sleeves/tights for fancy nights out.  2 semi-dressy vests, 1 men's suit jacket to pair with vests and bowties. ~7 bowties.  Kilts also for dancing: 3 (1 leather distressed/post apocalyptic, 1 rainbow, 1 industrial all black with rivets & D rings.)  Workout tights: ~10 pairs, most double as pajama bottoms or thermal underlayers in winter.  2 sweaters, 3 hoodies.    Shoes (not including reinforced toe work boots that stay at work) = combat boots, Demonias, cycling shoes with cleats, workout shoes, commuting shoes, hiking sandals, winter boots, and house slippers = 8 total.  (Also not including emergency sandals i keep in the car.)	episode_done:True

text:How do I improve my fashion sense beyond just tshirt and jeans?	labels:Knowing your measurements makes it 10x easier to shop imo! All you need is your hips, waist, bust, and maybe shoulder measurement and online shopping should be way easier. I know this is a little over-the-top for some folks, but I like to bring a tape measure to stores with me when I shop for clothes so I don‚Äôt have to try to guess my size (it helps in thrift stores especially).  I‚Äôm not sure what kind of styles specifically you‚Äôll be drawn to, but I recommend starting something similar to a capsule wardrobe! Find a bunch of basic, neutral(-ish) pieces in the style you like. You‚Äôll be able to match most of them together with each other and it‚Äôll be easier to make an outfit! I found that when I was younger it was hard for me to make an outfit because the pieces I was drawn to were usually bright or patterned and I couldn‚Äôt match anything together with each other. It‚Äôs much easier when you already have a lot of pieces for that purpose. Also, neutral doesn‚Äôt have to mean boring if that‚Äôs not what you‚Äôre drawn to! For most people it tends to mean stuff in white, black, gray, tan, etc., but I have a more colorful wardrobe so I tend to think of most of my clothes that are a solid color as part of the capsule, because for the most part, I can pair them together with each other and make them look nice.  And overall, remember to have fun! Shopping and finding a new style can be a little frustrating at times but the whole point is to feel good about what you wear. I hope it goes well, good luck!	episode_done:True

text:Do you follow the conventional rules around "flattering your figure?"	labels:I've written about this before, but as someone who is 5'2 on a good day, I have stopped giving a shit about looking "longer and leaner."  In fact, I reject the idea that I should want to look taller. Maybe all those 5'7 women should be taking advice on how to make their legs look as stubby as mine. <--Obviously a joke but to make a point. How stupid is it that I should feel like my natural body is something to correct?  I'm an old woman, lol, and over the course of my life I have never found that my stubby legs (that I was once self-conscious about) have kept me from career advancement or from finding people who thought I was beautiful and wanted to have sex with me, so what's the freaking problem?  Fuck conventional figure flattery.  That being said, of course there are things I think look better on me than other things and I tend to wear the things I think look better in ways I think look better most of the time.  Except when the comfort or beauty of a garment is so outstanding it overrules that.  Thanks for coming to my TED talk.  There are cookies on the table in the back.
text:So happy to hear this expressed so well.  I am short.  I've been, at various times, self conscious about it & listened to the seemingly universally accepted notion that it is desirable to look taller.  Now, the idea that taller is objectively better is a crap idea I bought into mindlessly.  I'm embracing my height and rebelling against choosing my clothes with the aim of looking taller.  I will buy what I like and what I think looks good.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:How do you tell when discounted items were never full price?	labels:I think you should be able to search the name of an item on the brands actual website - if it‚Äôs part of their regular line and *not* made to be sold to outlets or discount stores, it should usually show up. Even if it‚Äôs not in stock anymore, it will still generally pop up - it will just say ‚Äúout of stock‚Äù or something similar. However, if the ‚Äòsecondhand‚Äô store has named the item something different, it‚Äôll be hard to find unless you can find the RN on the listing. YMMV.
text:I‚Äôve worked in wholesale my whole career and for companies that sell make-up (not actual makeup, product made specifically for the value channel) to MarMaxx, Nordstrom Rack and Ross. Brands that have an established diffusion line definitely design specifically for this channel and source lower quality materials for this line, however there are companies that design product that‚Äôs been sourced assuming it would be sold in the main line. Many times department stores pass on those designs but they are produced anyway for the value channel. Then sometimes it‚Äôs just surplus inventory that‚Äôs gets sold off at the end of a season.  If you see a large display in a TJMaxx store, merchandised with signage dedicated to that brand, it‚Äôs been merchandised and produced specifically for the value channel. If it‚Äôs on the racks and the same brand has that carved out spot on the floor, it was most likely main line that made its way at the end of the season to the value channel. You can check the brand‚Äôs website as mentioned above, but sometimes stores will negotiate that the product be exclusively for their store (Nordstrom does this) so you will never find it on the brand‚Äôs website. This is probably an exception to the rule but does happen. Look at how the product was merchandised if it looks planned out for the value channel and doesn‚Äôt look like it went from the factory, to the wholesaler‚Äôs DC to the retailer‚Äôs DC to the store, unpacked, out on the floor, touched by customers, pulled from the floor, repacked by employees that don‚Äôt care, to the retailer‚Äôs DC and then to a value store that unpacks it and puts it on the floor. There are some retailer‚Äôs that will sell off slow moving product to these types of stores too even if they don‚Äôt own a value channel themselves (like Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack), for example Lord and Taylor will sell inventory at the end of a season to the value channel.  That‚Äôs a very long way to say look at how the product is merchandised. Merchandising costs a lot and needs to be planned out way in advance with signage and marketing assets. If it‚Äôs merchandised like it was planned to be sold in that channel, it was.  For online retailers, if you see that brand regularly on gilt, they are making product for that channel. If it‚Äôs rare or you only see it at the end of the season, it‚Äôs main line product with extra inventory being sold off.  If you love it, and think it‚Äôs valued for what it‚Äôs being sold for...buy it!	labels:> For online retailers, if you see that brand regularly on gilt, they are making product for that channel. If it‚Äôs rare or you only see it at the end of the season, it‚Äôs main line product with extra inventory being sold off.  This is interesting because I regularly see current stuff at Gilt from high end fashion houses, and often in permanent colors (Gucci Dionysus, Celine Belt, etc). Are these returns, defected out, or something else? I'd love to hear more since I always wondered about those.	episode_done:True

text:What did people *actually* wear in 2000's?	labels:Low rise bell bottom (flared) jeans and cargo pants were a staple in my wardrobe, with cargo pants especially the cut was such that it'd be low rise, fitted around the butt, a bit more relaxed around the thighs and super loose and wide at the bottom. You'd wear them with wide cushy skater shoes to let them catch most of the pant leg but often it would grad on the ground and get ripped which was ok.  Tops were fitted with short sleeves and often a scoop neck and a little short so with the low rise jeans you'd see a bit (or a lot) of skin. If you weren't comfortable with showing skin you could wear 2-3 spaghetti strap cotton tops over each other, it was important that each layer could be seen from underneath and you had to buy tops specifically designed for this look since layering normal tank tops wouldn't have given the same look. If it was cold, you'd wear either a big hoodie over the top, or more popular, a fitted zipped hoodie that you'd wear open like a jacket.

My build is pretty "banana-y" or square. I'm not curvy so they look "wrong" or "ugly."  It took me awhile to just learn to just make myself do it and I have a few things that worked for me that maybe will help you.  - find something I like the look of on me/I feel like a badges in and make an outfit around it. I bought a punk half hoodie that took me eight months to figure out how to wear it because I needed to find an outfit.   - find one thing you like about yourself in the outfit and look yourself in the eye and say what looks good. I feel like an idiot sometimes but ill twist at one angle and be like "damn I look goooooood" and hype myself up when I need it. Doesn't always work, but sometimes it does  - if you're feeling too self conscious to wear it out, either make a short run to a drive through or small errand like at Walmart, or change the outfit a little until it's right. I put on makeup and a boss outfit. Had to take the makeup and one accessory off because it was just too much to conquer  - get a hype squad. I wore an outfit I was NOT comfortable in. A skirt. Ended up going out to walk and be by myself to test how I felt. Decided to invite a friend out for impromptu lunch and she was like "omg you are so fucking cute." And she made us take photos of us being cute. I was so self conscious but I am so glad she made me take the pics. She also talked about how cute I was twice in unrelated conversations when she could fit it in. We gave GOT to hype each other up.	episode_done:True

text:To add on to the others, Harris Tweed sport coats have been in-style since the 50s, and the tweed typically suits a more classic, relaxed cut, meaning that the cuts of modern Harris Tweed offerings are pretty similar to the cuts of vintage Harris Tweed offerings.

Everyone is busy looking at, thinking about, critiquing themselves.  So wear what makes you happy! Try new things!   Edited for concision.
text:>No one is looking at you, thinking about you, critiquing you as much as you think they are.  Absolutely not true for me. My friends and family comment on attire all the time, and it's not always pleasant. If it's something classic, comfortable, "boring" (not like Amish clothes, but average?) I hear nothing. If it's a bright color, or any pattern, or even blue jeans (don't wear them often), I get all kinds of comments ranging from surprise to passive agressive insult to over-exhuberant compliment. Don't even get me started on accessories or hairstyle.  It makes me so self-conscious.   Just once, it would be nice to hear, "I like your outfit," and that be the end of it.  No, they're not overly religious or conservative or anything like that. They all wear a wide range of colors, styles, and accessories, and talk about it comfortably.

text:Rant - I'm fed up with fashion and "expressing myself"	labels:Have you thought about uniform dressing? I'm not talking about a boring black t-shirt and jeans every day. I wear a dress, sweater, and black pair of shoes every day. In the winder I add tights/leggings and an ankle book (summer is black sandals). I never have to think too much about what I wear and I don't really have to make any decisions after I purchase the item. My dresses are really comfortable, all of them have pockets, and I get compliments constantly. Uniform dressing sounds really boring, but you can create a fun and unique type of uniform if you want.  I tried a capsule wardrobe earlier this summer. It had dresses, shirts, pants and shorts, but I went back just dresses because the capsule was too many decisions. I just pick a dress that is clean and move on with my day, but I also still have a distinct and unique style.

text:Best White T-Shirts for Men 2021 - Wirecutter	labels:As far as "basic tee reviews" articles go, this one is among the more thorough, but I'm gonna repost a take I made in GD the last time we did this [just over a month ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/k24w1u/general_discussion_november_27_2020/gds99z0/), because I think it's important to consider.  >Hot take: speaking from experience, fetishistically optimizing the most basic of basics (e.g. "the best plain white t-shirt") for maximum imagined value is not a meaningful nor worthwhile exercise. Your wardrobe is not more interesting because your white tee is better than another white tee, and by the time you've found the 'perfect' piece either the prevailing trend or your own preferences will probably have changed.  >'Perfect tee' threads are usually highly-upvoted, but the answers have drawn from the same pool for the last goddamn decade:  >- *Vintage/workwear (generally heavier, boxier, shorter):* 3sixteen, Buzz Rickson's, Lady White Co. - *Streetwear (generally lighter, slimmer, longer):* Reigning Champ, wings + horns, John Elliott - *"Normal" (somewhere in the middle)*: Naked & Famous, Arket, American Apparel when they still existed - *Edgy goth shit:* Rick Owens mainline for lighter and DRKSHDW for heavier, Kazuyuki Kumagai Attachment, Voidthebrand when they still existed - *Budget*: Muji, Uniqlo, Everlane, Bella+Canvas, etc., but no one really cares  >It's functionally a solved question. You can pick one from the applicable list for your style, and it'll be *fine.*  I tried this back in the day, bought plain tees by the 'winners' of my research at the time (Reigning Champ, wings + horns, Battenwear, Velva Sheen, 3sixteen, Norse Projects), and wore them every single day for over six months in an attempt to stress-test which was the "best" -- and what I realized was that frankly, good enough is good enough, and I wasn't getting any kind of meaningful benefit from the exercise.  If you dress for functional purposes (dates, jobs, etc.) no one really cares, and if you dress to express personal style you're probably not learning much from variations on a basic tee. Treating clothes like optimizing your stats in an RPG or a performance head-to-head between an i9-10900K and 5900x is mostly pointless, in my view.
text:I agree with the sentiment that good enough is often good enough when it comes to something as basic as a white tee. I think there's still some value in having these discussions, though.  - Given the accessible subject matter, more feel comfortable participating. While this might not always generate novel or interesting discussion, it gives those starting out an opportunity to practice talking critically about clothing. The question of "What's the best white t-shirt (for you)?" may be uninteresting for those further along, just like "What's your favorite color?" isn't really an engaging topic for most adults. But to a child it could be an engrossing topic, and an opportunity to practice expressing oneself (I don't have kids so maybe it's a garbage analogy). - Some people just enjoy min-maxing, who am I to tell a roll-player their fun is wrong? (Not saying you're doing that.) It's probably an inefficient use of time if the goal is solely function or style, but if people want to enjoy their hobby by analyzing minutae to death, I won't begrudge them that. - Following from the last point: I could be misremembering Foucault, but I think he made a point about how, in moderns times, talking about sex is as much a pleasure as the act itself. Dissecting the white tee might be the fashion equivalent of asking how to best perform the missionary position, but even so, I think for most people the discussion is an end in itself, rather than the means to an answer. - Last but not least, without a "best white T-shirts" post I would never have gotten to read your comment, so there's that. Nowadays the thing I enjoy most about MFA is watching the discourse go through its sort of dialectical(?) evolution. I don't know when it started (or if it had always been there), but it was Haleopteryx's effort posts that first made me notice. It feels like the number of well-argued contrarian perspectives has grown since then, with lots of thoughtful dissections of prevailing wisdom. Good things can grow out of shit, is what I'm saying. (It sounded more compelling in my head. Also meant mostly in jest, I'm certainly no arbiter of quality.)  edit: typos n tone	labels:quality comment  now make shittier ones if you want to enable good things to grow	episode_done:True
text:Hand wash only clothes	labels:I think that this really depends on what type of washing machine you have access to. If you have a modern, front loading machine, with multiple wash settings, you can relatively easily machine wash many ‚Äúhand wash only‚Äù items. I‚Äôve had varying results with top loaders or old front loading washers-I find them more rough on clothes. Most items do ok on a delicates cycle with cold water for both stages. I often wash sweaters on the wool setting (cold water, low spin) or soak my sweaters with euclean and spin dry-er in the machine before laying flat to dry. Most of the damage to clothes happens in the dryer IMO. Also, brands often put dry clean only or hand wash only because they haven‚Äôt tested the fabric for machine wash and want plausible deniability-thus many things can survive with machine wash cold and air dry. But your results may naturally vary based on the piece of clothing. I personally only buy stuff that I feel is very special that is not machine wash air dry safe. Otherwise I feel like laundry ends up taking too much of my life, and it isn‚Äôt worth it to me.

text:When/why did you get your first really fancy purse/bag?	labels:It hasn't happened yet! I first thought about it about 10 years ago, and honestly every couple years I will fixate on one purse as my big "investment" bag. I had occasions that could have justified it, but just couldn't pull the trigger because of sticker shock. Looking back, I actually don't regret not buying it... I (used to) travel a lot, and having the freedom to use and abuse my favourite bags instead of gingerly babying it is kind of a relief.   Also, I put that purse money into buying fancy coats instead! Where I live we have a solid 4 months of below freezing temps per year, and in those months literally all you ever see me in is the coat... it's too cold to take it off for any kind of cute outfit underneath lol. I feel like I get way more out of that investment. I had also eyed the Burberry trenches for years, but in the end couldn't justify the price tag for the probably 2 weeks of wear I'd get out of it per year.	episode_done:True
text:I've taken 566 outfit photos over 4 years (my style from mid-20s to 30)	labels:Thanks for sharing this, it really resonated with me.

I like that your new approach is both thoughtful and organic, in that you‚Äôre not constantly trying to cultivate ~a look~ that you‚Äôve seen somewhere, but you‚Äôre also thoughtful about what you do bring into your wardrobe.  As a side note I have always loved your outfit posts on this subreddit - your posts introduced me to the idea of layering tops over dresses to make them look like skirts, and now some of my all time favorite outfits are dress + top combos! Such a great tip for getting more use out of my wardrobe.	episode_done:True

text:Does anyone else feel that nothing is unfashionable nowadays?	labels:Hmmm... I dont agree with the no defining silhouette. I would say a lot of decades have more than 1 silhouette as a defining style (early 60s and late 60s are super different; same for early and late 1990s ); 1920s had a mainstream look vs the flapper look; etc). And for this decade I can think of two silhouttes that defined the decade for me.   One is the Kim Kardashian/SheIn style - long skin-tight dresses/skirts down to the calves or so in neutral colors. It was popular from like 2016 to 2018, with some bleadthrough until now, although personally that style is unflattering on me (I'm short and dont like things that cling at the waist).   As for the early 2010s, I can picture that kind of Zooey Deshanel, "New Girl", with the 50s kind of flared A-line skirts, bright colors, with maybe polka dots on them, and paired with like blouses, and a hair bandolete.  I think the current style (straighter lines and earthy tones) will be more remembered as an early 2020s thing.

Then, if I don't end up wearing the secondhand items I can just donate them to Goodwill. I don't have the guilt of buying something and then not wearing it enough.	episode_done:True

I‚Äôve lived in socal before and can handle dry heat but the humid heat sucks my soul out of my face pores. Thank goodness it‚Äôs starting to cool down. It‚Äôs my third summer here and still my most glimmering hope is for public nudity to become legal, widespread, and accepted in the region so I can let the hot humid breeze be my regalia.  The best advice I‚Äôve gotten from a native so far is from a man who said ‚Äúembrace the heat‚Äù and wears a hoodie and toboggan (what they call knit hats down here) in the summer. So I‚Äôve done that, I‚Äôve embraced the heat at least so I can not feel total despair when I have to wear pants in my workspace.  But if there are any other humid heat tips people have out there, I am a willing student. Magic fabrics? Sizing up so everything isn‚Äôt so hard to get out of? Would a swimsuit instead of a bra be advisable?

When those M-65 style jackets and liners started becoming mainstream, it seems that vintage places began popular among people beyond that group.  But I think many have moved on since old military stuff indeed have really strange fits.  I personally collected a few but ended up selling all of them because they're honestly not that comfortable to wear. more modern stuff has better stretch, are lighter, just as warm, and are better fitting.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:I know ‚Äúfashion‚Äù but people of minorities are always forced to try better. Some Insights	labels:I'm Asian, not black, but this reminds me of something I've consciously learned to do in my career, to try to actively contradict stereotypes in order to encourage colleagues to actually engage with me as an individual with my own strengths, weaknesses, and personality. In the U.S., stereotypes aren't nearly as harmful for Asians as they are for black men, but in the workforce I've seen a lot of Asians plateau at the lower level, informal team lead positions, while getting stuck being hidden away when it comes time to build relationships or manage long-term, strategic goals.  I've played up my blue collar background in order to disarm the "nerd" stereotype, and I've played up my military background as necessary to remind people that I have management and leadership experience, and that I'm not just the guy hired to be some technical specialist, or the one-off task. It's also an easy way to connect with other vets.   Early in my white collar career, I retained my military haircut, maintained a stronger (rather than a leaner/cardio-friendly) build, because from what I've seen, a bit of a subconscious bias about blue collar = power lifter while white collar = weekend marathoner.  Now that I've climbed the ladder a bit I've been able to back off some, and adopt a bit more of the style and look of a mid-career white collar professional (but in a fashion-conscious way). I've also gotten older so I haven't hit my strength (or my cardio) goals in a while, and I look more like a white collar professional that way, too.   And maybe I'm overthinking things, but I found that leaning into meathead or combat vet stereotypes allowed me to avoid being pigeonholed like so many other Asians who came before me. So this linked study at least seems roughly analogous to what I had already seemingly experienced, albeit in a very different context with very different considerations.

text:Couple of things:  1) Part of it is styling. Rick's collections have themes and the best way to convey them is to style the outfits according to a given theme rather than an everyday outfit. Buyers for retail stores can choose individual pieces when they see the collection and visit the showroom.  2) Many of these outfits aren't that crazy. I find looks 36-44 pretty wearable with the exceptions of 39 and 42 (although they'd be a hit at some gay clubs). I've worn something similar to [look 3](https://assets.vogue.com/photos/6009b3b8a497859ba8648ae4/master/w_480%2Cc_limit/00003-RICK-OWENS-MENSWEAR-FALL-21.jpg) in the past. It was pre-Covid so there was no mask, and my sweater didn'thave holes and lumps in the midsection. But it was a similar formula. Thick loose oversized sweater, big drapey coat on top, close-fitting pants, and I wore combat boots instead of high-top sneakers.

I also loved what Joi wore, so I am just gonna steal those.  But if its not an office wear or wanna look cool wear, no high heels. I hate high heels on people who fight. With passion. Sexi female outfits with heels are my number one hate thing for action films. I will never be able to take Wonder Woman or Black widow seriously because of this.

Here are some things my lizard overlord likes for now. I'm sure this will change:  * Comfort first - nothing itchy, restrictive, or painful. This is my most important "rule". * Colors/patterns - I love combining different colors and/or patterns, but they need to have something in common in order for me to like them together, e.g. both patterns have a similar color or the colors are a similar shade. I have always hated wearing pastels/neons and tend to prefer jewel tones or earth tones (although I don't usually like mixing them together). * Statement pieces - I tend to prefer minimalist or maximalist combinations although I can't dress quite as maximalist as I would like due to the limitations of my wardrobe. * Silhouette - I tend to like all pieces form fitting or all relaxed. I have a weird hang up when it comes to skinny jeans w/ oversized tops but am perfectly fine w/ the combo of straight leg jeans with an oversized top or a form fitting top w/ skinny jeans. * Feminine/masculine - I like feminine elements to outfits but tend to combine them with something more gender neutral. For example, if I wear a white dress with lace on it, I'll pair it with black combat boots.  EDIT: Thanks for all the love, but I am not u/FriskyGatos \- just a huge fan. I guess my post wasn't clear in that I was citing her ideas rather than posting my own IG.

text:Is fast fashion really fast fashion if you get years of use out of the garments?	labels:It's really hard nowadays to live a completely ethical lifestyle. Like that scene in The Good Place where a person ordered avocado toast and was destined to go to hell because he was unknowingly supporting drug cartels (or something like this)  But just consuming less is a step in the right direction. Only buying things you absolutely love and will use for years.   If you're making a good salary, you have the luxury of buying from more ethical companies that are in line with your values.   I buy very few things nowadays and always Marie Kondo it "does this bring me joy?" and "how often will I wear it?"  - I've slowly filled my closet with more ethical brands because I'm looking for things that'll last me years, but I still have some Zara and h&m pieces
text:I'd say there's no ethical consumption in capitalism when one looks at the nuts and bolts.

text:Are our ideas about what looks ‚Äúdated‚Äù on either ourselves or others affected by or correlated with our age?	labels:Oh this is interesting! I've actually been thinking a lot about this. I'm 44, and interested in fashion as an historian, and also have been rewatching a bunch of movies from the early 2000s-2010 lately and wondering about how dated the clothes look to my eyes vs a younger person's.      Three thoughts (from the perspective of a person interested in, but not IN the fashion world and not super stylish):   1. I think there is a certain tendency, as you get older, to get less concerned about style trends because you start to see things come and go. When you're in your late teens, you wouldn't be caught DEAD in something unstylish. You're so caught up in the zeitgeist that you "get" perfectly what current style means, and things that are out of style are really ugly and uncomfortable for you. (Not everyone; there will always be people who like to be out of sync or quirky or oppositional. I'm talking about ppl interested in Fashion here.) As you get older, you witness the cycle where the Super Hot Thing is suddenly . . . gone, and the Horrible Unfashionable Thing is now HOT (ahem: SCRUNCHIES), and around again, and you can't help but take shit less seriously. "Dated" is not as serious an insult; you have a bit of a broader view. I'm not really defending wearing the same clothes for 30 years, just explaining why older women feel less frantic about wearing unstylish things.      2. Time also speeds up as you get older. I was watching the movies circa 2010 (which, incidentally, do NOT hold up; so much more casual sexism!!), and had a hard time telling much difference in the clothes. But 10 years ago doesn't seem that long ago to me. I've been reading the threads on skinny jeans and realizing that I still think of skinny jeans as a "recent" development. If you're 25, skinny jeans have been in style your whole adult life and 10 years was AGES ago. I saw a photo of myself wearing a certain top from 5 years ago and realized I still thought of it as a "new" top, lol. My point is, we have to work harder to think "current."     3. I also want to point out: our goal as women should not be to look "young" if we're not. Some of the criticisms of older women wearing "dated" clothes are about those women "showing their age." Well, what of it? I'm 44. I earned every year of my life. I don't need to look like a 25 year old. 25-year-olds look beautiful, fresh, amazing in this year's styles. I don't need to buy a whole new wardrobe to look brand new every year; I don't need to look like "mutton dressed as lamb," as the Victorians said. I'll keep an open mind to new shapes and silhouettes, as another commenter said, and update pieces, but I don't really care if people find my clothes "dated" overall.
text:I feel this discussion so much, and love your points. I'm 35. I've been aware for a few years that my clothes are becoming "dated". Yesterday I saw a Tom and Lorenzo post about Kate Middleton in which she wore skinny jeans and they noted that was "dated" and may be her version of the Queen's perma-80s-helmet-hair: a thing that she glommed onto and keeps way past the point it is "stale" to everyone else.   I was working clothing retail when skinny jeans were coming into fashion 15 years ago, and I remember how at first it just seemed like a totally WILD trend!! The most fashionable of my coworkers would wear the skinny jeans and the ultra-high round-toe heels (by Jessica Simpson, probably), and over the roughly year and a half I worked there (early 2006 to mid 2007), skinny jeans went from this thing that was, perhaps, a bit too edgy for midwestern teenagers to The Thing To Have. I have lived in skinny jeans for over a decade.   Now I need new jeans, and find myself somewhat lost. I LOVED big flares in my middle schoo/high school days of the late 90s and early aughts, but now that style seems... juvenile to me?   On the other hand, I know my preferred silhouette of "leggings or skinny jeans (dark wash) and regular top or tunic-length shirt" is increasingly stale. A couple years ago it was "no longer on trend but acceptable", and now I know I look "dated" to younger folks. But they, with their pleated high-waist light-wash jeans and crop tops look SO WEIRD to me. I can't see myself in those clothes.  So this has caused me to step back and think about what I care about and how I want to be perceived. On some level I do want to be seen as "cool", but I'm also not really willing to invest the money and energy in keeping my clothes trendy. So how do I balance that? How do I dress in a way that doesn't look like "ooof she hasn't updated her style since 2012" (accurate!!) but also feels genuine to myself, and comfortable?   On ffacj recently there was a post about "RIP Hipster Fashion 2010" and it had women in moto jackets and leggings and chunky boots. And that's still what's "cool" to me. The early 90s-inspired stuff evokes "hah! Youths!!"   But I also need new jeans, and I should probably buy jeans other than dark-wash jeggings, I guess.	labels:I'm still fairly new to fashion and I've recently realized that my most flattering outfits are all flowy/drapey/oversized tops that hide the weird silhouette of my franken-torso and then more fitted bottoms that show off my long legs. Now of course trends have moved away from this entirely and I feel like I'm doomed to either be unfashionable or looking like I'm in ill-fitted clothing. Any suggestions on how to make this not so out dated?	episode_done:True
text:Do you think fashion or style has age restrictions?	labels:Honestly... yes. I‚Äôm all for people wearing what they want to wear and expressing themselves however they want, but it can‚Äôt be denied that, in general, a woman who physically doesn‚Äôt match the youthfulness of her clothes is going to get some judgment. It‚Äôs similar to how people like to retort that they can say anything they want ‚Äúbecause it‚Äôs a free country‚Äù. Sure, but that doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre free from the consequences of and the reactions from others towards your speech.   At the same time, I also think there‚Äôs some leeway in how youthful your clothes can be, depending on how you already look. Obviously a 30 year old who looks 20 wearing the outfit you described isn‚Äôt going to get the same judgment a 30 year old who looks 40+ would.   Editing to add: I don‚Äôt think 30 is a good threshold for this discussion though, 30 is still really young (I say this as someone younger than 30) so you can still pass in those clothes. I think a better threshold to start this discussion at would be 45+
text:Agree! I feel like people should feel free to wear anything they want unless it is inappropriate or offensive to do so (for example, wearing ripped denim to a formal royal wedding, or festival wear to a company presentation).  I think the amount of times people will stop you in the street and comment for dressing a certain way, negatively, is infrequent. If they are rude, pay them no mind.	labels:Yes, definitely unless its inappropriate or offensive. I probably should have clarified - I don't necessarily think people will stop you and comment on on too youthful outfit to your face, but I definitely think they'll do it in their heads or to whoever they're with. For sure the best practice is to pay it no mind, but it doesn't preclude the judgment in the first place.	episode_done:True

text:I like this, thank you. I recently moved to a much smaller town in a much different climate (DC>FL) and I've been down in the dumps about 1) the lack of shopping other than online, 2) everyone here is super casual (beach town), 3) it's too warm to wear any of my designer/fancy clothes, which were more intended for a place that has actual seasons.

text:Do you follow the conventional rules around "flattering your figure?"	labels:I've written about this before, but as someone who is 5'2 on a good day, I have stopped giving a shit about looking "longer and leaner."  In fact, I reject the idea that I should want to look taller. Maybe all those 5'7 women should be taking advice on how to make their legs look as stubby as mine. <--Obviously a joke but to make a point. How stupid is it that I should feel like my natural body is something to correct?  I'm an old woman, lol, and over the course of my life I have never found that my stubby legs (that I was once self-conscious about) have kept me from career advancement or from finding people who thought I was beautiful and wanted to have sex with me, so what's the freaking problem?  Fuck conventional figure flattery.  That being said, of course there are things I think look better on me than other things and I tend to wear the things I think look better in ways I think look better most of the time.  Except when the comfort or beauty of a garment is so outstanding it overrules that.  Thanks for coming to my TED talk.  There are cookies on the table in the back.
text:Best comment here.  But really, I can just head my mom telling me that my outfit is ‚Äúfigure flattering‚Äù as the greatest compliment...  I used to abide by that idea 100 percent when I had no confidence and felt I needed to try to look as skinny as possible - because that‚Äôs what figure flattering means. F that.

Good example of this style that I‚Äôm looking at is from pro skater Nyjah Huston (@nyjah) on his Instagram.  I was wondering if anyone can determine what the size/type of his clothes are and how his fit looks like it is. I‚Äôm around the same build as him being 5‚Äô9 and would like to buy clothes that are the same size as his.   Would his shirts be considered a certain fit or type? Or do you think he is just going up in shirt sizes? What size would it be? Should I be aware of different sleeve lengths when shopping?   As for shorts, what inseam size do you believe they are? What type of shorts has the cut on the side?
text:He looks like a medium build; he‚Äôs probably wearing xl t shirts. Most of the videos of him riding look like nike 3 inch running shorts.

text:Summer outfit inspiration: An inspo album and 6 lessons on how to make complete outfits even when you are dying of heat stroke	labels:Used to live in US Southwest, temps 100+F in summer.    Clothing depends on what your activity is. If you're just going to the office, layers are key. Pants, short sleeve shirt, blazer/cardigan. Air conditioning can be brutal.   Day to day errands, dresses can be super nice (with safety shorts). DO pick ones that cover your shoulders/back/neck if you can, those areas sunburn very easily!   After the sun goes down, dark colors are fine and will make lighter clothing look more formal.   As someone else mentioned, moisture wicking athleisure can be nice (think tennis/golf polo).  Sneakers work surprisingly well. Sandals are nice, but make sure you don't get sunburn on the tops of your feet. Also don't ever go barefoot, pavement gets hot enough to give you 2nd degree burns in seconds.      Notice how many times I say "after dark" here, there's a reason many cultures with hot summers have a culture of socializing/doing errands in the evening!	episode_done:True

My office was pretty casual and I tended to be on the fancier side of things (the ongoing joke with my coworkers was that I didn't know what a casual outfit was, even when wearing jeans) and I found a lot of joy in getting to wear that stuff. When we return to office in the future I might cut down on the amount of heels I own, but even when I am putting on real clothes while working from home I miss having shoes be an integral part of feeling put together.   On the other hand, I am wearing my summer clothes a little more than I normally do because I'm not bound by the freezing A/C of the office and it's nice getting to wear things like "that top that can be a bit risque when bending down for something in the office" because calls are just video.

It's just a matter of using techniques and good quality materials.

They're not fancy, but they fit my hard-to-fit feet and they're super comfortable.  I really haven't worn anything else on my feet since I bought these.  The insoles they came with were pretty terrible, so I bought some warm fuzzy ones and my feet are happy now.  Best non-clothing purchase was my new phone.  I went from a cheapo model to a still budget but actually useful model and holy cow that's a huge difference.  Worst:  Lane Bryant bra that straight up does not fit.  I let the sales lady talk me into going with a size that was not the one the ABTF calculator gave me, and even though it mostly fit in the dressing room it is NOT a good bra on me.  Worst non-clothing purchase is hands down the refurb galaxy s9+.

text:If you had $5,000 to What-Not-To-Wear style re-do your whole wardrobe, how would you do it? What would be your process? What would you prioritize?	labels:I would buy several high quality basics, a few splurge items, and get everything tailored to fit perfectly. Such as $100 jeans instead of $10 jeggings off the rack at discount stores like cRoss or sMarshalls (first thing that comes to mind).   Right now I'm in a constant state of needing new clothes. Quantity is key, so I have to sacrifice quality because of my budget. If I had an established, good quality base wardrobe then I could afford to shop less often and thereby purchase higher quality pieces.	episode_done:True
text:The Queen‚Äôs Gambit Inspo Album	labels:I HAVE BEEN WAITING PATIENTLY FOR THIS POST.  My favorite outfits of the show, by far, were pretty much everything she wore in the last episode. I LOVED THAT PUSSYBOW GREEN VELVET BLOUSE during her game with Luschenko SO MUCH. Also, the fitted grey dress in the last game and the chess-inspired mod black and white dress during the first, and the evergreen turtleneck she wore casually at the hotel. The ALL-WHITE OUTFIT AT THE END WITH MATCHING HAT. I die.  I have red hair and her wardrobe in that episode was basically my dream wardrobe.
text:Yes that green velvet and then the thick wool grey dress in the borgov game are amazing! Also the mohair cardigan when she‚Äôs dancing around her house. I‚Äôm dreaming about them!	labels:	episode_done:True

text:>Burberry wool trench   Do you get a lot of use out of it or is it just mainly for certain occasions ?	labels:I got tons of use out of it. Sweater and jeans? Put it on and your out fit elevated. Perfect for day out or date. With shirt and tie, I instantly feel like power dressing. I have it for 3 years now and planning to keep it forever.	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - December 30, 2020	labels:/u/theteenagegentleman   Ethan, quite the barrage of shots fired in the newest podcast/blog post. It was funny listening to it and having the same IG account/influencer come to mind over and over again... and then hearing your take on the *x* thousand follower thank you post completely confirming that he's one of the guys on your shit list, haha.
text:Hahahaha. TECHNICALLY it could apply to...a few people since I‚Äôve seen all in that ‚Äúpod‚Äù (unconfirmed) do similar content and captions.  I also debated posting the pod/essay here but it‚Äôs so tangential to actual men‚Äôs fashion that I decided against it lol	labels:Looking at the other guys that are probably in that pod (I actually don't follow any of the others) for a few minutes made me ponder something... do you think Spier & Mackay is making a concerted advertising push for Marling & Evans through their pod? I had never heard of that mill before Jesse posted what feels like a dozen sport coats made up in their wools the last four months.	episode_done:True
text:Women with ADHD & Sensory Processing Disorder: I need Clothing recs!	labels:I feel this. Comfort is so extremely important to me in clothing. My sensory issues have gotten way better as an adult, but when I was a kid I couldn't stand the feeling of anything that wasn't 100% cotton.   I often jokingly describe my personal aesthetic as "business casual pajamas". I wear lots of blazers and dress pants, but also jumpsuits and dresses. I really like pieces that have some structure and can easily be dressed up or down, but are soft and comfortable enough for lounging around the house.   I have a very strong preference for ponte and jersey knit clothing. Cotton or silk is great, but other fibers work as well - I find that these fabrics feel soft and comfortable in a variety of different fibers. I particularly like ponte because it is so comfortable but is thick enough to have some structure and drapes really beautifully. It's amazing for things like blazers and dress pants.  The other things I look for in clothes are influenced by a combination of aesthetics and comfort. I like wide leg pants, high-waisted bottoms, sleeveless tops (but no spaghetti straps), maxi dresses, things that wrap around me, dolman and kimono sleeves, plunging necklines, elastic waistbands that don't look like elastic waistbands, clothes without polyester or acetate linings, tops that don't ride up and exposed skin at my waist. Probably lots more stuff.   I also switched to wearing boxer briefs, which I find infinitely more comfortable than any other style of underwear. No panty lines, no riding up.   Oh, and I don't own a single pair of jeans and I don't plan to change that in the foreseeable future. I don't find denim comfortable at all.
text:For dress pants I suggest Nic + Zoe Wonderstretch pants. I get them at Nordstrom and can usually find them on sale. They are a stretchy fabric that still looks professional (good enough for me as a college professor). They move with you and many of them have waists that fit like high rise leggings.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What was your first 'expensive' fashion purchase?	labels:I'm 40 and still don't have an "expensive" purchase.  I'm frugal by nature and won't buy something unless I know I can get to the $1 wear (ie I must wear a $20 item 20 times).  I've seen some expensive items in store and from feeling them up and checking for quality, the quality did not justify the price point.  The most expensive clothing item I owned was a pair of shoes.  They were for a wedding so I had no choice in the shoes or price point.   I changed after the ceremony because those things hurt my feet like crazy.  I wish I had sold them instead of donating them.	episode_done:True

text:Do you have a recommendation for what sort of white face paint to use? And how to best apply it? Very impressed with your work!	labels:I use Ben Nye stage makeup products when I can. This is their "clown white," mixed with flesh tone or other colors as needed. Straight up white doesn't always look right.  I carve out what I need from the pot (a very small amount, it goes a long way), and use the back of my hand as a palette to warm it up and a flat brush to mix. I am usually too lazy to use a sponge so I'll use my fingers to apply it, but a sponge works best if you need to something more nuanced. Translucent powder to set!	episode_done:True

text:What was your "how in the name of all that is holy did this end up in a thrift store" find?	labels:A few weeks ago I found a really nice suit jacket. I‚Äôve been wanting to wear more blazers so I was looking in the men‚Äôs section at goodwill and I found one that was super soft and just very lovely. I thought I‚Äôd take it home and remove the shoulder pads and wear it. So I bought it, and when I got home and looked at it, it turned out to be a Brooks Brother‚Äôs jacket! I looked it up and the closet to it I could find was a $600 blazer on their website. I paid $4 for it! It‚Äôs in perfect condition and I found it the reason it‚Äôs so soft is because it‚Äôs made of CASHMERE and GENUINE WOOL.   Now I don‚Äôt know what to do with it lol. It‚Äôs too small for my husband and obviously I‚Äôm not going to doctor it. It‚Äôs just hanging in my closet for the foreseeable future I guessüòÖ

text:Spend $250 on a good replica bag or Tory Burch?	labels:I buy pre-owned past season bags exclusively. The discount is 80%-90% off the retail usually. So, I‚Äôd pick that option? I don‚Äôt believe replicas have the same quality, IME. Also, I don‚Äôt feel the same joy when I carry them so it‚Äôs not worth it for me.	episode_done:True
text:What style rules or clothing attributes are you ruthless about?	labels:I have well water in an area with high iron. I refuse to buy any light colored clothing, it will turn orange and it‚Äôs very hard to get out. So all whites and nudes are a big nope. It‚Äôs a good thing I enjoy dressing in mostly black lol.	episode_done:True
text:Overdressing - Discussion	labels:Oh god. I'm instantly reminded of the embarrassment I felt whenever I showed up to a pregame for a frat formal and then realized it was SEMIFORMAL. I was there in a long red gown and everyone was in minidresses... I already felt out of place because I wasn't in a sorority, just was dating a guy in the frat. Thankfully I begged my bf at the time to bring me home before the formal and I changed to a better dress.  Anyway, I tend to be an overdresser. In college I felt more comfortable dressed how I wanted to rather than in big tshirts and athletic shorts or leggings. At the office, I work with a bunch of old dudes that are wearing polos at their dressiest lol. I'm perfectly fine being the odd one out there.  I think it's mostly rude to overdress whenever there's a stated dresscode. Like in my first example, I wouldn't call it "rude" but it definitely looked off.
text:Yes! This reminds me of the embarrassment I felt at a work function. It was our annual conference and there was an evening social which was to be a white party (you wear white and then they are blacklights and things look cool). The description just said to wear white. There was going to be a DJ and a dance floor. So I went with a one-shouldered, short white dress. Not crazy tight but a dress for a night out on the town.   I show up and most people are wearing jeans and maybe a white tee-shirt. I tried to act confident all night and own it, but I felt like people were staring at me.	labels:It sounds like you looked great. A lot of people just don't own anything dressy in white (I know I don't; I've have been stuck in a white shirt or white jeans.)	episode_done:True
text:The best of basics: Black Leggings	labels:I love old navy elevate leggings. They‚Äôre in between a cotton legging and an athletic legging  so they‚Äôre thicker but don‚Äôt look overtly sporty. The high waist is a plus and they‚Äôre usually on sale for $20. I wore aerie leggings for years and still have a bunch of them but I don‚Äôt usually wear them out of the house anymore because they‚Äôre too thin (and see through) and they slide down constantly.
text:I have them in grey. Be warned they run tiiiiiny	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Skirts and dresses in winter - how to look good and be warm with a combo of boots, socks, tights?	labels:So, imo, knees high boots with a dress and sweater looks adorable, is very feminine, and is also fairly warm. Here are some examples: [one](https://pin.it/3lLTHdY), [two](https://pin.it/1YrSUiU), [three](https://pin.it/2N3NzIe), [four](https://pin.it/1mGqZBe), [five](https://pin.it/4a5li4h).  I probably wouldn't wear ankle boots with a dress/skirt without tights, but I guess it would depend on how long the dress/skirt is. If I had to choose an ankle boot, I'd go for something like [this](https://pin.it/5XBXphK), so I could at least wear thick socks. I also think it really depends on your body type. I can't wear a Chelsea boot because they make my legs look huge, but cowboy style ankle boots are fine.
text:These kind of examples confuse me -- am I the only one that finds it weird to go out without outerwear in the cold weather? If it's warm enough to wear those sweaters without a jacket outside, won't it be too hot when they get indoors?	labels:I think it depends largely on where you live and how long you're going to be spending outside. I live in the southern part of the mid-Atlantic region and can wear outfits like these well into winter most of the time, especially if I'm just going from my car to office or car to happy hour. I don't feel like places crank the heat once indoors unless it's really chilly out, so if it's like 50 degrees outside, it's maybe 65 inside and I, personally, would still be comfortable.	episode_done:True

I love that they‚Äôre 100% cotton and the quality has been great so far. I also don‚Äôt feel as guilty shopping there because they actually pay workers fairly well and they‚Äôre a pretty transparent company. I‚Äôm trying to make the switch to natural fibers and although this brand isn‚Äôt exactly cheap, it‚Äôs better than $70 60% polyester sweatpants!  Worst- oh gosh, most of my orders from Poshmark. I don‚Äôt blame sellers but I think my idea of ‚Äúgood condition‚Äù isn‚Äôt universal. I had a really cute jumpsuit arrive but I had to shave it for about an hour and it also had a ton of repairs made to it that the seller didn‚Äôt mention. Still gave five stars because I don‚Äôt want to be an asshole.  Edit: spaced it out :)  Edit: I completely forgot! Poshmark actually came through with these gorgeous [Jeffrey Campbell boots](https://www.hautelookcdn.com/products/BXS/large/12413869.jpg).

text:Summer outfit inspiration: An inspo album and 6 lessons on how to make complete outfits even when you are dying of heat stroke	labels:Checking in from Brazil here with my summer staples:  - I always have a good pair of jean cut off shorts as well as a few other solid color shorts I can dress up if needed (the solid color pieces I go for more structured fabrics, interesting cuts and finishes)  - I don‚Äôt accessorize much since I live in Rio and we avoid using too much jewelry here for safety reasons, but I love adding a straw hat or classic ray ban aviators to my look. Both are functional and can work with most summer looks  - i love using sarongs (here they are called ‚Äúcangas‚Äù) as skirts with a regular top to have an easy/breezy look. They are usually made of very light material and you can find beautiful prints!  [heres an example from a local brand I love](https://www.emibeachwear.com.br/canga-viscose-tamara/p)  - when it comes to shoes I basically have three categories in summer: (1) interesting flat sandals (colorful, with some sort of details, jeweled, etc. which can really be a fun addition to a jean short + tshirt look), (2) white sneakers with at least a little tiny sock (love it even with a calf-length dress) and (3) a very comfortable heal [like these espadrilles](https://instagram.com/lojafelipa?igshid=1r4q0bbchgp2w) if I‚Äôm going somewhere that needs it (which is rare here n Rio).   Besides these, my biggest summer dress-well/feel-well tip is constant showers. Theres no such thing as too many in a day when you‚Äôre sweating every time you run an errand or do something. It really helps in looking and feeling fresh as you go through different moments of the day and when you put on a new outfit! (Sorry if this is basic and also has nothing to do with the sub haha)	episode_done:True
text:How to find the confidence to wear clothes you like?	labels:Look at my profile. It's not easy to wear what you want, but you can do it. Most of the people in the world are only thinking about themselves. You'll be so much happier if you just be yourself. Do what you want.

text:Difficulty distinguishing between so 'idealized' style and personal style?	labels:All the time. I have a smaller waist and big hips and a butt and thighs and am never going to look great in tailored pants or straight skirts. I will never be able to do French Girl Chic and I have to be really careful with those floaty looks you like because I can easily go Earth Mother when I don't really want that.  For what it's worth your "model off duty" in reality is probably wearing jeans and a tee and flats or flat boots.    You might want to make a pinterest board and then consider how a garment that you like could be incorporated with the rest of your clothing. A pair of skinny jeans and a floaty romantic top short or long can be very cute.
text:SAME. I'm short with a tiny torso and wide hips/butt. I loved mori kei and edwardian gothic and dressed that way for years, but finally came to terms with the fact that the wispy long skirts and scarves just looked like Professor Sprout cosplay on me. I love her character, but it wasn't the look I was going for.  But, I did end up using some of my old mori kei clothes to be Professor Sprout for Halloween a couple of years ago.	labels:That made me so hard!  DAMMIT "laugh so hard".  Now I feel like an idiot.  I think you can do some things as long as you enhance the waist and don't let the rest get too full or too long.  But yes a lot of that can overwhelm a shorter frame.	episode_done:True

text:Has anyone else ever tried on a designer item just to see what the hype is about?	labels:I work in the shoe trade and I can say that designer doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean better quality. I‚Äôve seen some horrors in my time. Doesn‚Äôt matter whether you‚Äôre Walmart or Balenciaga, anyone can suffer quality control issues.  Agree with comments - look beyond the label, look at the finishing, the materials. It‚Äôs incredible the amount of luxury shoes I see with creased linings (which are gonna make your feet sore) or badly set heel seats. (you know - when a high heel won‚Äôt stand up on a flat surface and wobbles). But I think designer casual wear is the biggest rip off - theres not much you can add to a printed t shirt, to add value, it is what it is.

text:What will be obsolete by summer 2021?	labels:Fanny packs/bum bags. They've already had one foot out the door after having a moment for the past 2 or so years, and I think they'll well and truly be gone by next summer. Women have moved onto baguette bags to replace the fanny pack craze, and I personally like it a lot more!
text:Fanny packs are way too functional to ever go away imo.	labels:Agree, and while until a couple of years ago you could only get a ‚Äòcute‚Äô one at Lululemon, now virtually all designer brands from YSL to Ferragamo have classic styles as part of their main lines. I have never seen this much variety, from Farfetch to H&M, and while fast fashion will obviously fully embrace the next trend and phase them out I think (and hope) those classic styles won‚Äôt disappear.	episode_done:True
text:People who've been working from home for most of 2020 - do you think your work style will change when you go back to the office (compared to your work wardrobe pre-lockdown)? If so, how?	labels:I have been working from home in sweatpants and leggings since March and will WFH until at least summer 2021.   I miss going to the office and feeling cute, and being seen by others. A woman I work with told me ‚Äòyou always have the cutest dresses‚Äô about a year ago and I absolutely loved hearing that. I‚Äôve learned in quarantine that I don‚Äôt dress for myself, I dress for other people.   I‚Äôll probably dress up a bit more when I can go back and wear more lipstick, since I‚Äôve been in comfy slouch mode for so long.
text:I‚Äôm exactly the same. I had a Rent the Runway unlimited membership that I used mainly for playing around with my work style. There were stretches of weeks if not months where I don‚Äôt think I wore any of my own clothes. I would legit be a little disappointed if I didn‚Äôt get some sort of comment about my outfit every day.   I‚Äôm not going back until at least next September and RTR Unlimited is going away so I have no idea what my style will be when I go back.

text:Does anyone else have ‚Äúirony pieces‚Äù?	labels:A long time ago, a friend at work told me no one would take me seriously as long as I wore cheapo pantyhose.  I looked down at my crappy nylons and actually felt cheap. I went to Nordtroms that night and bought presentable nylons and wore them to work the next day. She nodded in approvement and then told me no one would take me seriously as long as I wore cheap sweaters. I then bought a wildly pretty ivory cable knit sweater and wore it to work and feeling quite exactly like 1000000 bucks AND i had fancy nylons too. She told me no one would take me seriously with my unkempt shoes and that's when I learned the power of a shoe shining kit.  The next day I wore crappy slacks...and, well you know how the story goes.  To this very day I wear natty clothes and shoes so shiney they can blind fleet of Greek warriors.  The only real irony is no one gave a tootie about nylons and yet I still wear them despite all evidence to the contrary....and she threw al hers away after our company got bought out by another and they were no longer required. (I point at my perfectly appointed knees).

People around the office were gossiping that I was trying to find a man. "No, a man is looking for HER!", she told them.   Then suddenly she disappeared. Quit over the phone and changed her number. I like to think she was an angel in a very impressionable time for me, but I think she might have just had issues with her work visa.	labels:There is a Ukrainian woman who works at my hospital.

text:What's an "outdated" item you still love and wear although the style has fallen out of fashion?	labels:Not exactly fallen out of fashion, but it's more often used in lingerie.  Corsets.

They‚Äôre usually high quality materials with lovely little finishing details (one of my dresses from them has lace along the inside of the hem, so even if your skirt moves so people see the inside, it‚Äôs still pretty!). The prints are cheerful without being to outr√©, which works for my life, and they tend not to use many muted colors, which suits my complexion.	episode_done:True
text:Canada Goose Workers Allege Unsafe Working Conditions in Winnipeg Factories. ‚ÄúBefore I came to Canada I was in Qatar and then Dubai and it‚Äôs the same here in Canada Goose: No humanity.‚Äù	labels:In a culture that has generally turned on wearing fur for fashion, I dunno how this company gets a pass. A lot of people I spoke when I was involved in an anti-Canada Goose pressure campaign didn‚Äôt know it was real fur skinned off coyotes.   Canada Goose is unethical trash and you smell like a wet dog when it rains. I‚Äôm not surprised a company that‚Äôs super lax about its supply chain doesn‚Äôt value its workers. Most folks involved in animal exploitation sectors are exploited immigrants.
text:I don‚Äôt get why everyone is up in arms about coyote fur, when it‚Äôs a jacket full of you know, essentially bird fur.	labels:You know what. I know nothing about fashion (reason I joined this sub) but in all these years it didn't occur to me that Canada Goose actually used geese, let alone fur.

Weight gain is nothing to be ashamed of, but I commend you for trying to be healthier - that shit isn't easy!!  As for the "wanting to look professional but wanting to look / feel like myself", I think a LOT of people struggle with this. I feel like for the emo look, wearing all black can still be seen as very professional, I think the issue more would be the cuts of the clothes. It also depends on your profession / workplace - obviously some places are much more lenient and you can get away with a lot more skin. Maybe wearing jewelry that is more alternative can also be a good way to look professional but feel like yourself.	episode_done:True
text:For the parents of girls	labels:when I was a little girl my mom would buy the clothes she thought were cute and dress me in them. we would go to thrift stores and she would pick things out for me. we would butt heads a bit because I was always a headstrong child and wanted to do things like wear skirts in the winter or pajamas to the grocery store.   then when I got a little older I wanted to wear all the trendy brands my friends were wearing, so she bought me that stuff even if she didn‚Äôt personally like it. now that I‚Äôm an adult I dress similar to how my mom did when I was a child. I guess my tastes developed from familiarity, since as a preteen I saw my mom‚Äôs unique style (sundance catalogue vibes with chunky jewelry, lots of knitwear, big cowboy hats and boots) as embarrassing, but now I gravitate towards it and think it‚Äôs really pretty and glamorous.	episode_done:True

I love how the jeans look but I'm worried they're too small for my waist. I've previously bought jeans from Levi's with this waist size (31) and they've been comfortable (100% cotton), but these feel a little snug for my liking.      Do they need to be broken in? Do slim jeans run small?     [Here's some pictures](https://imgur.com/a/QozXAPB)
text:They look like they fit very well on you. If the waist is a bit snug and they're new, they'll stretch out a bit over time.   Levi's also has somewhat inconsistent sizing due to the scale that they manufacture at, so sometimes sizes arent exact.	labels:Thanks Swordknight.

text:How do you actually incorporate colour in your wardrobe?	labels:Haha when you said you used to get inspo from fashion blogs aimed for people much older I felt 12 year old you... I'm twelve rn and find so much inspo on FFA even tho I'm years younger than most ppl! I get lots of inspo from different clothing sites (eg aritzia)... I got the Alessia cardigan from there in the Luminous Violet color (very purple lol) and I have a few outfits with it. I usually look to pair with basic colors. If I'm wearing purple I gravitate towards blacks and darker hues whereas with a lighter color e.g. blue I might look at whites/creams/beiges. With the bright purple cardi I have a fit incorporating greens and amatching-ish purple hue (like what the model in the pic is wearing) which really pulls the look together.  In summary when I'm wearing bold colors I'll either   a. wear basics (such as the blacks/whites/greys you said you have so much of) with the bright color to make it pop  b. wear another funky color with your outfit but make it match. when you incorporate the color in multiple times it makes it look super put together, and though you may think it looks like something a messed up preschooler may wear it actually gives the opposite affect...   c. if you're still timid about wearing bright colors, try starting with basic colors for clothes but really dope accessories or shoes. Bella Hadid has been sporting layered chunky rings... not good for any professional setting but is an example of how you can incorporate color even if it isn't in clothing pieces.	episode_done:True

Some highlights:   My first pair of Uggs (found for $45!)  New work clothes from LOFT A pair of Sorel boots i had been eyeing for years (retail $150+, found for $45)   As others have said a lot of what I bought is comfy clothes for being stuck at home, but I also graduated from college this year so I've also bought a lot of clothes for "when I get a grown up job."

text:I bet the fact that you have 5 to rotate through had something to do with not developing a smell.	labels:Well any shoe if you wear it every day will develop something.  In that case wearing a bit of body powder should help, but the point stands that it's not disgusting at all.	episode_done:True
text:When/why did you get your first really fancy purse/bag?	labels:I was 25 and had been working hard. I had a baby at 22, the year I was accepted into university. At 25 I had graduated and been working my first ‚Äúreal job‚Äù for about 6 months, and working a job on the side as well to help us buy our first house. My husband bought me a $300 coach bag for Christmas and told me how proud he was. It was a beautiful bag and I carried it for 10 years. I just replaced it this year with a lovely Michael Kors bag I caught on clearance for $150. I would never buy a purse I didn‚Äôt love for the sake of the name, but having a beautiful purse you love can be so empowering.	episode_done:True
text:People who used to play super safe with fashion, how did you overcome your fear of bold choices?	labels:For french tucks specifically - some tops just don't work for it. I have one sweater that I french tuck a lot. It's a loose sweater and I have no idea how to describe this properly but it's like...flexible? It's super easy to tuck the front in no worries.   Then I have another sweater that I tried to french tuck the other day. It's also a loose sweater, but it's stiffer and was less easy to tuck. I then went downstairs and my boyfriend said it looked like I went to the toilet and didn't realise my top was stuck in my pants.   So I think part of it could be that some tops just don't french tuck well?  But otherwise, my best advice is to just watch a tonne of Queer Eye. The women Tan dresses aren't skinny and perfect looking and he doesn't dress them in a way that aims for that. He dresses them to show what they've got but the outfits themselves look great.	episode_done:True
text:Article: Why Is Fashion So Beige This Season?	labels:I'm loving the colors this year! Browns, greens, and blues are my favorite colors (and also are my colors!) and it's been so much fun being able to find clothing in my color scheme instead of hot pinks, yellows, and bold colors and pastels that wash me out.  &#x200B;  I am not a huge fan of the doe-beige color though. It looks too grandma-esque to me.

Not the shiny gold and silver ones but the more "cool" looking or black ones (idk any terms sorry). I have a few questions because idk where to look.  What are your thoughts on rings? What type of rings would you recommend? Where should I look? Any tips or advice?
text:To start, unless there is a specific ring that you really really love, a very basic silver ring is IMO the best way for yourself and your entourage to get used to you wearing them. And contrary to your post and contrary to instinct, in my view simple silver rings are more innocuous/inconspicuous than an "edgy" or black one.  My reasoning being :    1. You're a man wearing a ring (nothing wrong with that, but fewer men do compared to women) that's not a wedding ring. First reason you'll "stand out".   2. A silver ring conforms more to the "general" idea that we have of a ring compared to a black one f.e so wearing the latter will give a second reason to stand out.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:FAQ: How do I pick the right size buying online?	labels:One: know your measurements. Measuring tape is super cheap and comes in handy more than you‚Äôd think.   Two: try to shop places with per-garment measurements. Everlane and uniqlo offer mostly-accurate measurements of every individual piece, which is great because exact measurements vary between garments.   Three: if you are shopping at somewhere with a general size chart, trying googling. Jcrew lists their sizes as smaller than banana republic, but in reality they‚Äôre actually larger. You might need to just buy two sizes and see which works. Actually, if you really like a shop‚Äôs clothing, there are worse ideas than buying a basic Jean, t shirt, and button up from the brand in two sizes each and establishing a baseline. Be harsh! You might forgive the sleeves being too long when you‚Äôre trying it on, but if the arms swallow you it will rot in the back of closet because you‚Äôll end up avoiding it.

text:Cold weather friendly skirts and dresses	labels:I also hate wearing pants. Don‚Äôt know how cold we‚Äôre talking but up to around  40 F, I would pretty much wear any autumn-y skirt/dress and rely on my wool tights, knee high leather boots, and a long wool coat to provide warmth for my lower body. Personally, most of the skirts I chose to wear were 100% cotton denim, leather, or suede!
text:I like a mid-calf wool skirt that has plenty of folds, a wide hem, and a satin lining. The shape allows freedom of movement and room for other layers, and the smooth lining defeats friction so the hem doesn‚Äôt bunch up.   In the depth of winter, I‚Äôll wear silk long johns and Cuddle-Duds pants underneath; the Duds are easy to pull off without putting on a show when I get to my desk. (I dislike changing in a bathroom.)  Lately I‚Äôve had the thought that the ideal under layer might be those Indian-style pants with the crotch that comes down to the knee.	labels:Where do you purchase such a skirt??	episode_done:True
text:What was your "how in the name of all that is holy did this end up in a thrift store" find?	labels:Saw a really cute wicker chair outside a huge Salvation Army thrift store in a town somewhat near my home a week prior... so when I was in the area again, I decided to run inside and see if the chair was still there. It wasn‚Äôt....  BUT, sign stating ‚Äúeverything on this rack $4-‚Äú caught my eye, and I picked up two lamb skin leather jackets by Cole Haan and two cashmere sweaters. (Was middle of summer in south FL... NOBODY is thinking about coats and sweaters!!) Was also able to get high quality velvet skirt in a large woman‚Äôs size that I made into a skirt for Christmas tree off same rack.  Thinking I had landed the deal of the century, I quickly glanced at shoes which were primarily too worn too ugly or not my size.  As I turned the corner to check out the next aisle of shoes, there was a pair of Joseph seibel mules-in my size - that appeared brand new sitting right in the middle of the aisle on the floor.  I slipped my feet in...and they were perfect. When I got to the counter to pay, I realized there wasn‚Äôt a price on the shoes.  The clerk stated ‚Äú how about $3?‚Äù And before I could reply, she added ‚Äúand it‚Äôs Thursday, so they‚Äôll be $1.50 today‚Äù.  üò≥. I was informed that every Thursday everything in the store is 50% off!!  So my big haul... in fact, biggest one I‚Äôve ever had was 2 leather jackets, 2 cashmere sweaters, Aprox 3 yards (retail $27yd) velvet large skirt, and a pair of Joseph seibel shoes for...$11.50!!!!ü•≥ Down side of the story? As I was checking out, the woman behind me questioned why I was buying a skirt that obviously wouldn‚Äôt fit me.. and ‚Äúyou smaller women need to stick to your own sizes and leave the limited selection of larger clothing for someone that can actually use it‚Äù. üò≥üòâ. Don‚Äôt understand HER logic... and was none of her business what I was buying or how I would use it, but didn‚Äôt feel right to explain that I shop large women‚Äôs sizes all the time in thrift stores because there is more material yardage.  Still, her comment bothered me. I didn‚Äôt know it was impolite to buy clothing that might fit someone else??  Whatever.... Later that day as I was admiring my new shoes, it dawned on me that it was possible those shoes may have belonged to someone shopping in the store... someone trying on shoes?..(there were a few trying shoes on..) After all, these shoes stuck out not only because they were sitting on the floor in the middle of the aisle.... but also because they were in perfect condition. Guilt overtook me for a few minutes, but resolved when I thought maybe the nasty woman behind me had tried on a pair of shoes... got distracted (maybe by seeing small ladies browsing the larger woman‚Äôs section?) and forgot to put her own shoes back on!! Perfect end to perfect thrift shop haul.
text:Wow! That's so many beautiful things! Especially if the leather jackets were still in nice condition, normally by the time I see them in thrift stores they're dry/cracked/worn.   I'd feel weird approaching and criticizing a total stranger ahead of me in line,  but I do hear a lot of larger/fat/plus-sized women say they find thrifting really difficult (practically speaking and emotionally) because there are fewer plus-sized clothes available. And they (mostly) can't buy a smaller size and make it bigger the way a smaller person could take something in. I can see how it would be frustrating. I do a lot of sewing and refashioning, and I know that's true in my area so I try not to buy things more than a size or two up/down unless it's something that looks downright unwearable as a garment (ie, one panel of a skirt is really stained but the other is still nice).	labels:I can sympathize with large women that find thrifting difficult, but I‚Äôm sorry, that is not going to stop me from looking for quality fabric in larger size section. It‚Äôs not like it was a one day sale and I camped overnight to be the first one there and bought the entire rack. If it‚Äôs hanging on a rack-it‚Äôs for sale-period. I have often bought garments -in any size- for embellishments that were on it. Sequin patches, beaded trim, etc.  It‚Äôs ridiculous to assume smaller women should refrain from looking at larger sizes until all the plus size women have shopped and made their selections. It‚Äôs a thrift shop. Someone had already owned the garment and had no use for it anymore. I bought it b/c I did....and was a steal compared to the $27-/yard it would have cost me retail. I, also, ‚Äúremodel‚Äù clothes...and have combined two dif garments to make one.  I admit it‚Äôs a rarity...but it‚Äôs happened.  Plus sized women have less of a selection in retail stores as well. It‚Äôs economics.	episode_done:True

text:What did your mom teach you about fashion/style - and what did she not teach you?	labels:SImilar to a lot of other people replying, my mother simply did not have the time to care about fashion. As an immigrant, she worked three jobs in healthcare in addition to caring for us, the kids, and just dressed in scrubs or what was functional and comfortable - I almost never saw her buy any clothes for herself, and she never wore makeup.   To be honest, I never ever wished that she had taught me anything - I don't feel like it was her responsibility to teach me to look aesthetically good. I feel like it's a great privilege for me to have the time/money/interest to dedicate to even begin thinking about style/fashion/beauty. If I have children I will certainly teach them confidence and how to take HEALTHY care of their skin, but I wouldn't impose my ideas of beauty or aesthetics on them if they were not interested. I don‚Äôt even feel it is ‚Äúimportant‚Äù - it‚Äôs my own interest but some people just don‚Äôt prioritize it, which is totally totally fine and doesn‚Äôt make them worse people.
text:I love your reply.  I feel badly for OP‚Äôs mom. Not all women care/have knowledge about fashion, makeup, hair removal, etc. It‚Äôs strange to expect that she would and is just holding out on her daughter to be malicious. How dare she give her daughter the impression that appearances aren‚Äôt the most important thing in the world?  It‚Äôs like a guy growing up and getting into cars and then being pissed his dad didn‚Äôt teach him about cars, even though his dad didn‚Äôt care about cars or didn‚Äôt drive or preferred bicycles.  My mother didn‚Äôt care very much about any of that stuff and worked a lot, so she didn‚Äôt teach me. I learned about it all by reading magazines, and later through the internet.

text:FAQ: What is the environmental impact of different fabrics?	labels:I think a proper answer to this question would require a research team, a lot of money, and a lot of time. Here's some top-level things I know about various fabrics/materials:  * Cotton requires a lot of water to become a fabric. Especially anything that's "washed" like non-raw denim. (See Levi's Water-less line) * Any synthetic fabrics are made from fancy plastic and release micro plastics into the water every time you wash them. Even the tees and fleeces that are made from recycled plastics. There are [bags](https://www.patagonia.com/product/guppyfriend-washing-bag/GP001.html) and filters you can buy which supposedly cut down on the amount of micro plastics that actually make it into the water supply. I can't speak at all to how effective they actually are.  * Leathers of any kind require a lot of water and various "chemicals" to tan. Vegetable tanning is generally regarded as ~~better~~ less bad than chrome tanned leathers. * The excuse that "leather is a by-product of the meat industry" is basically a dumb trick of economics and the definition of "by-product". Meat is a larger industry and is more popular than leather so cows that are raise are more or less called "angus/beef" cows instead of "leather" cows because most of the money in them comes from the meat and not the hides. Farmers still make money off of selling the hides and such. If everyone stopped eating beef overnight then leather would no longer a by-product it'd be the main product. Don't get sucked into this excuse. * Fabric treatments, in general, are "bad". Waterproofing, non-iron, etc. * Washing clothes is "bad". Similar to how the majority of the environmental footprint of combustion engine cars comes from after they're sold, a large part of the environmental footprint of clothing comes from once it reaches your house. More specifically when you wash your clothes. Lots of washers aren't high-efficiency and use a lot of water, more energy if you don't wash on cold, dryers use a ton of energy, etc.   Hopefully someone else can talk about wool. I personally know nothing about it.  This is all really surface-level takes and there's more than enough nuance to go around that I've avoided in this comment. As always, if your primary goal is to have a small environmental footprint, there's a reason the order is reduce, reuse, recycle. Buy less.
text:Regarding ‚ÄúThe excuse that "leather is a by-product of the meat industry" is basically a dumb trick of economics and the definition of "by-product".‚Äú  Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong here cause I genuinely don‚Äôt know, but isn‚Äôt this only true of industrial grade leather in the first place, like wouldn‚Äôt nicer footwear brands(a la alden) and especially niche avant garde places like Guidi, CCP and Pollacki being using hides from farms growing animals with the specific intent of having higher quality leather, thereby making it much less of a by product?	labels:To my knowledge there aren‚Äôt really any animals raised specifically for hides.

text:Have you ever gotten tons of compliments on something but are still on the fence?	labels:Well about the hair, I often think that a color that is your natural color or close to it looks better than others and this is something that other people are more likely to notice because the person whose hair it is has so many feelings and idealizations that contribute to inaccurate perception. But whatever you feel most comfortable in is right. I get rid of stuff all the time that other people think looks nice that I just don‚Äôt feel right about.	episode_done:True

text:Post-Baby Problems I Wish Someone Had Warned Me About	labels:Hmmmmmmmm, while I can imagine some of these happening a few of them sound to me like badly/incompletely recovered pelvic floor and core streght damage.  Typical are that shapewear support your back - it means your core muscles aren‚Äòt doing their job so your back muscles are doing extra work. Would also explain a much too blocky midsection. And pelvic issues go hand in hand with uncomfortable tampons.  For anyone who feels this is relevant - other typical postpartum pelvic floor issues are: weak lackluster orgasms, uncomfortably lax OR overly tight sex, inability to control farts or pee/poo.  Most importantly these issues can be worked on and largely fixed!
text:You can also end up with extra tension in parts of your pelvic floor that cause issues that seem unrelated or the opposite of what you‚Äôve been told to watch for.

text:Brooks Brothers's Future Looks a Lot Like Menswear‚Äôs Past	labels:* Less SKUs. The amount of stuff BB sells is overwhelming.  * Do away with there weirdly named fit system. Change it to Extra Slim, Slim, Regular, Thicc Daddies * Revamp the BB website. It's been terrible for a long time. * Have the athleisure stuff, but also focus on high quality basics, again with less SKUs. Have something like an "essentials" line. The Navy Suit. The Charcoal Suit. The OCDB. The Chino. The Wool Trouser. Without fifty million variations thereof. You go now and it's like here are three navy suits with different kinds of stretch, here are four more with some kind of temperature controlling fabric. Just give me a half to full canvas lined 100% wool navy suit in various fits and sizes. In other words, simplify your menswear line to cut down on SKUs, and that will give you more room to play with sheep on skis and stuff (i think that does sound kind of cute, very Ralph Lauren). * Do away with Golden Fleece, Red Fleece. Mainline only. Again confusing to the consumer. * Where BB could play more is in areas like sport shirts. By all means offer your classics like blackwatch etc., but other menswear shops like Sid Mashburn or Todd Snyder offer all kinds of fun prints and colors while still feeling like classic #menswear.  i dunno, just riffing my own personal desires for BB. i don't know anything about running a large clothing manufacturer and retailer.

text:When/why did you get your first really fancy purse/bag?	labels:I‚Äôm planning on purchasing my first designer bag after I graduate from medical school. Figure if I‚Äôve made it through to that point, I can treat myself. Not sure what yet, looking at classic shapes and more modest brands like Mulberry. I‚Äôll probably purchase a designer wallet after my first large exam later this year! Will probably continue to purchase as major milestone gifts for myself, though will most likely purchase second hand for numerous reasons.
text:I'm also planning my first designer bag for after graduation, but it'll be law school for me! I'm eyeing the Louis Vuitton Speedy 25. I got my first SLG as a you-survived-your-COVID-job reward, and it was the LV mini pochette accessoires. I think making a small purchase, like a wallet, is a good way to get a sense if it's worth it. I was worried that I would regret getting spending so much on an accessory, but I figured it would be better to regret a $365 purchase than a $1000+ one. But so far, I am happy to report no regrets, and it makes me all the more motivated to get the bag. Good luck in med school, and I hope you enjoy your wallet and bag!	labels:	episode_done:True

text:When/why did you get your first really fancy purse/bag?	labels:When I was in college, my mother gifted me a gorgeous green Gucci shoulder bag with a black bow. That kicked off my obsession with bags - first with borrowing hers, then saving up for my own. We bond over fashion in general and often swap photos/texts over bag trends. It took me a while and a few rungs in the career ladder before I could afford to buy my own though.

text:Trying to get into jewelry	labels:It depends on the person, so ymmv. But when I'm trying to branch out and try different styles of jewelry, I get super cheap stuff on AliExpress. If I like the look/style of some pieces, I'll invest in higher quality pieces from there. That way if something is not for me, I don't feel bad about throwing it away.
text:Good suggestion! Thanks	labels:I'd try to avoid AliExpress (and Shein etc) for jewellery (or in general) because they shamelessly rip off designers and artisans' own original designs and then sell them at a pittance. I also avoid buying from sellers on etsy/depop/eBay who are using AliExpress charms for similar reasons. It's not always easy to know whether something has been stolen (Etsy is flooded with AliExpress-type stuff)  but ruling out places where this is the actual business model is a start. Especially if you don't want loads of pieces you may as well spend the few extra ¬£¬£ supporting designers, or at least not harming them.	episode_done:True

And then if there are other colors on my first item I will pick whatever I have left (if I picked the shirt now I look for the pants) but if there are no other colors on the main item I go with the color scheme of the other item I picked and try matching it with that.   Then it‚Äôs easier to pick earrings, necklaces and having all that done I pick my shoes and bag.	episode_done:True
text:Rant - I'm fed up with fashion and "expressing myself"	labels:I am a privileged middle aged African American woman who is deemed beautiful by strangers, another rant altogether. I love dressing. I hail from a family of women who loved clothing, and who always looked well groomed and dressed to the hilt. Here is your panacea. Thrift shops and used clothes outlets. I have gotten so spoiled over the last couple of years of buying pristine good quality, unique clothing and art at used stores, that I now find big box traditional clothes stores. Irish and gauche. As a high school teacher, my students and colleagues compliment me on how I dress, and even venture to say, they can‚Äôt wIt to see what I am going to put together next. I even purchased a real gold bracelet at a thrift store. I would suggest, a mid range large used clothing store. Better deals and pricing. Truly, when I go to Kohl‚Äôs or Macy‚Äôs I am bored to death, with the bland and costly choices. I have every color of corduroy pants imaginable, beautiful tops and sweaters that are the current styles and so chic. The only downfall, I recently moved from VA where my ultimate thrift store was located to MD, so I can‚Äôt go as often S I would like. But, I have more clothes and shoes that I could ever where in a season. I still have stuff with tags on them. I shop for what is drop dead gorgeous. Like last year I picked up a beige laced boho shoulder bag. Later, at the same shop, I bought a pair of beige Lacey wedge summer wedges that match the bag perfectly. I went into a regular store at the mall and picked up a long beige lace dress shirt which matches the three purchases beautifully  My birthday is coming up, and I plan to wear the sheer beige shirt dress over a cream off white A line dress with the shoes and purse. My point, when you thrift shop, you can‚Äôt be in the mind set of. I need red pants that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here, it‚Äôs more like, let me find that unique item that is a show stopper that I can add to my wardrobe or build around. Money is not a hindrance to me. I earn 6 figures. And I would still refuse to pay regular prices at say a Talbots or Neiman Marcus. A couple of years ago I bought a sweater and a matching pair of velvet pants at $250 at Talbots. I have purchased the same combo at $20 at my fav thrift store.  Endless to say, I felt like an idiot.  Because I knew I could spend way less money for the same value at a thrift store. Good luck in your fashion journey. I hope my experience helps you:)	episode_done:True

I heard chain stores are usually lower quality but considering it's a plain band, does it matter?  For her band, if it's also a basic design, do I also need to go to a specialty jeweler?

Finding those brands that match your ethics, your price point and your style is great.  However, I do feel your frustration. There have been so many times when I know exactly what I want but I can't find it anywhere.  For example, I want a knitted beanie for winter, preferably in a deep green. Nothing fancy, just a beanie. Can't for the life of me find one that fits my head. The part that frustrates me more is having to find more bespoke sizes (I'm petite, pear-shaped and apparently have a tiny head too!).  But it's definitely worth it when you do! E.g. I found the perfect pair of Levi's that I've had for over a year, got them on sale, they look like they are going to last me for years and years and I'm so glad I've found them.

text:That levi's looks like a more modernized version of a type 3. A more traditional type 3 has stitching in lines underneath the pocket.  Both look like they fit you very well! Lee also makes good denim jacket and they have just as storied of a history as Levi's.  I think the Levi's jacket here is a bit more minimal, slim and streamlined, whereas the Lee is more rugged (leather collar and additional stitching) and loose fitting. Whichever one of those vibes sounds more appealing to you, you should get. I will say that if you intend to wear a hoodie or other thick midlayer underneath, the Lee looks like it will be more comfortable.	labels:cool cool thank you!	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 18, 2021	labels:For context, I'm 19 and I recently bought around $500 worth of clothes for black friday and this is the first time I've ever gone shopping for clothes for myself on a large scale.  Instead of looking for fashion trends I just looked for clothes that I thought would look good on me.  As my clothes got delivered, I tried them all on and was really happy with the way I looked.   But, recently something happened that made me very self-conscious about what I wear in public.  I was at a kickback with a couple of my friends, and a girl I didn't know walked up to me after I was done playing chess with my friend.  The first thing she said to me was "is that your boyfriend?"  This was a very weird situation for me because the first interaction I have with this person is already bad.  I say "No, I'm straight," and she replies "Oh, I thought you were gay."  I asked her why she thought I was gay and she told me it was because of my outfit.  Then she asks to play a game of chess against me and I didn't want to be unpleasant so I accepted.  The entire 15 minutes of that chess game I wanted it to be over because of how fucked the situation was. I was wearing jeans, a striped shirt, and a tan blazer.  I also frequently wear silver stud earrings, nothing too blingy.  This experience really hurt me because I'm a very self-conscious person.  I really enjoy being comfortable in what I'm wearing, and this has made me reconsider what to wear in public.   Are there any fashion styles I should enjoy if I want to avoid being titled as gay?  Or should I just keep wearing what I want to wear? I'd say that my personality and the way that I speak is a clear indication that I am straight, I'm just worried about people judging me before they meet me (because clearly that happens).
text:First of all... Fuck what peple think, you do you.  Buuuut if you're really worried about being mis-labeled, I'd lose the earrings. I think you're safe with striped shirt + tan blazer, but you can share some photos here if you need reassurance. Hopefully your jeans aren't too skinny.  Buuuut really... The straightest thing you can do is get out there and date some women. Ask 'em out, that's not an ambiguous sign.	labels:Ok thanks for the advice.

text:What did people *actually* wear in 2000's?	labels:Is anyone going to talk about scene kid fashion or do I have to do it?? My uniform in like 2004/5 was low rise hollister skinny jeans, PUFFY ETNIES skater sneakers (+1 if they were the black sneakers with hot pink laces with stars) or crazy colored converse and a white studded belt, some terrible local bands t shirt and side bangs. Not just regular side bangs but side bangs that hid one eye completely   Then later we all discovered hairspray so we all got super choppy long mullets and teased the shit out of them. And still had side bangs but even swoopier and more comb-overy   Makeup was full bottom(!) waterline black eyeliner and the NUDE Mac lipstick that looked like foundation  * edit: I do remember my first pair of high waisted black skinny jeans in maybe 2007/8 and boy howdy did those BDGs change my life. Also this memory makes me feel very old because I can distinctly pinpoint the periods in my life when I aged into and then aged out of urban outfitters.

So if I feel like Wrangler one day and Gucci the next it is what it is.

text:How many clothes do you have? (Really?)	labels:I have a really hard time getting rid of clothes because I haven‚Äôt grown out of that high school mindset that if it fits then I must keep. Back then, I was terrible at finding clothes that actually fit my body so when I did, I clung to them even if I didn‚Äôt particularly like the item. Nowadays I shop much smarter, but I still find myself holding onto clothes that I don‚Äôt like. I had to force myself to do a legitimate closet clean out and this is what I‚Äôm left with (excluding my workout/sleep clothes):   Age/Nationality: 20/United States  T-shirts, longsleeves, & tanks: 42  Sweaters & Cardigans: 13  Hoodies: 7  Pants: 7  Leggings & sweats: 5  Skirts: 8  Dresses & overalls: 11  Outerwear: 15  Shoes: 12  Bags: 9   I own way too many damn jackets for someone who lives in California, but they all have an important place in my closet. So none of them are going anywhere  I also have too many ‚Äúmemory‚Äù clothes. I don‚Äôt like wearing hoodies, (I only wear 2 of them on a regular basis) yet I have so goddamn many because they all came from someone or some place special. If it weren‚Äôt such a space killer then I wouldn‚Äôt have a problem keeping them all.

text:Has consulting a stylist really been a revelation to you?	labels:A little over a year ago, my mom brought me along to a party her friend was hosting with a color analyst. We drank wine, gossipped about the goings-on around town, and each had our turn to get matched with a season and color palette.   To my utter surprise, I was identified as a cool summer -- which means blush pink, peach, slate grey, and all blues are in my range. As someone who previously limited myself to blacks, olives, and navy, it was a revelation. I look **AMAZING** in pastel pink. It makes me look like my skin is glowing!   Since then I've invested carefully in my new signature color with t-shirts, sweaters, hair bands, scarves, and special occasion dresses. I don't think I ever would have picked up a pastel if not for that party.  Edit: [Here's a photo of the first blush pink dress I bought.](https://imgur.com/a/AkLyhGN)
text:That color palette sounds lovely! And if you want olive, I wear olives with gray or blue undertones (vs yellow), which should work for you, too. You might like charcoal gray near your face in place of black. :)	labels:Yes, this is really good advice. My mom always told me when I was a kid that black was "too severe" on me but I never understood what she meant until recently. Charcoal grey and navy are softer and align more with my overall coloring.   Brown and khaki, on the other hand, make me look ill.

text:How do you care for your expensive/fragile pieces?	labels:Lots of people have posted laundry advice so I will post care advice   -Store knee high boots with chopped up pool noodles in them so they don't sag/fold and lose shape, or worse, permanently crease or crack the fabric   -try to never wear the same pair of shoes two days in a row because they need time to air out    -Certain tops can't be stored on normal hangers because a hanger crease will form. For sweaters, folding is recommended. For coats and jackets, you can buy a special wooden hanger which has more of a shoulder-like shape     -Make sure none of your crossbody bags with leather or faux leather straps are stored with the strap folded/crumpled up inside them because it will crease and deform    -Consider the texture of your bag when wearing one that rubs against the body. I've noticed that my clothing always pills in the area that my crossbody bags usually sit. Keep this in mind if you're wearing especially important/fragile clothing or if you're carrying a bag with a particularly rough texture    -Same with necklaces... It's very unlikely but the right style of pointy necklace with the wrong style of lace top could mean trouble. Oh, and also be careful of belt buckles next to delicate shirt or sweater fabrics    -If you don't prefer bags, you may notice that you quickly develop holes in your jacket pockets. Keys do a very surprising amount of damage , and I advise you keep them in a key holder or cute coin purse if they've been causing you problems. Bonus: they won't scratch the hell out of your phone when you accidentally put both in the same pocket (sorry, old ipod from a decade ago, I still feel bad about it)     -Don't even think about wearing leather in rain or snow unless you've applied a protective coating of some kind     -Once you're indoors after your leather has been rained or snowed on, immediately pat it dry with a towel (gently). If it absorbs the water it will swell     -If you live in a city where they salt the roads, don't wear anything you love below the knees during those seasons    -Don't leave clothing in direct sunlight, as the UV rays will fade dyes over time. If you have an "open closet" (garment rack) I recommend either moving it to a side of the room where it doesn't face a window, or adding a UV protective curtain    -If you're a hyperhydrosis-afflicted sweat monster like me, put sweat absorbing armpit pads in all your jackets (there are disposable sticker style ones and also washable ones that you add with safety pins)    -if you have expensive socks, store them laying flat on top of each other or gently rolled/folded, don't store them stretched over each other and squeezed into a ball like my mom taught me to    -Possibly a dumb one but i learned it the hard way... Certain fabrics are damaged by bug spray! I pretty much dissolved a pair of nylons once. I'm not sure what the specifics are but I'd be cautious for sure    -Another dumb one? Don't pull your pants up by your belt loops, unless you like re-sewing them...   -Getting zippers replaced is fairly expensive but it can be done (last time it cost me $50 CAD). Getting shoe soles replaced is very cheap and can be done on many shoes (last time it cost me $15 CAD but quality soles such as vibrams probably cost more). Jacket linings AND boot linings are also things that can be replaced. Always look into the price of repair methods before disposing of a garment.
text:>\-Store knee high boots with chopped up pool noodles in them so they don't sag/fold and lose shape, or worse, permanently crease or crack the fabric  Also loosely rolled up magazines work great. Particularly the thicker fashion magazine type. Or just get a few (3-4) small ones. Also effective and a good way to recycle them after you have read them. :P	labels:This is a great idea! Honestly I don't even use pool noodles myself, I just have a pile of old bubble wrap and crumpled paper that I am "recycling" (re-using I guess) from packages that I've received.

text:When is a garment worth it to you?	labels:Background: I'm transforming my wardrobe from generally smart casual type of thing to simply classic / conservative. Essentially that's a long term evolution, but one which I recently explicitly decided to go for.   This simplifies the process enormously as it enables me to list, categorize, evaluate, and prioritize my clothing needs. It took about one afternoon (i.e. several hours) to do, but I now have a list of the items I need.   I listed the current option and its status (good, passable, to be replaced, or missing), as well as its priority in terms of the importance-urgency matrix (both, only important, only urgent, or neither). For instance, I'm missing a certain type of a shoe, so it's "missing", but since I have something that I can use instead of that, I decided that it was important, but not urgent.  So first step: a garment is only worth it if I need it. If I don't need it, I won't buy it. I did a pivot table based on those two "scores" so I always have a handy list of things I need (did it on Google Sheets so it's easily available on the phone). This is a big improvement to earlier when I bought stuff much more randomly.   In terms of the price, I have an idea what a decent item in that category costs. For instance, I think that a pair of shoes costs 150 euros. For that type of money you can get a decent pair, if not a great one.  That doesn't mean, though, that it's what I'll spend. I may spend twice that much, or just half of it. But that figure is based on something; basically a list price of an item that's good enough.  That sets an expectation on both the quality and the price. So if I see something that I like (and is on the list, which I always check now before buying) and costs twice as much, I'll ask myself if it's twice as good as the list item. Or if it's only half of that, I'll ask if that's good enough or should I just buy the default one instead (if anything at all).  This fairly rational approach to final buying decisions has vastly improved my satisfaction regarding my purchases. Since starting this, I have not bought a single item that has not been used actively ever since.  Also, this has resulted in a less cluttered wardrobe. If for example I have an item set to "to be replaced", and I buy a new item, I will actually replace it, i.e. throw it away or give for a local charity to sell if it's still in good condition. Earlier, I would have likely kept the item, and probably used it too, if only very occasionally or just when I'm at home, but it's not like having that would make my life any better. So I've strictly limited the number of pieces I have because everything goes so well with other pieces.   I also now know exactly what I have. I think that alone is far more than what most people can say about their wardrobes. And each item now serves a proud purpose, so that has led me to take better care of them. What I mean is, I no longer have a number of garments, I have a wardrobe in which every piece is needed. It's more like a team than a crowd. That's oddly satisfying, too.  I think the key takeaway here is, to answer the original question, that this way there is a clear purpose to all pieces of clothing, and a clear expectation of the price, quality and style of a default item in that category. So, a garment is "worth it" if its price, quality and style are reasonable compared to the default item of that category. I suppose you could do that more easily, too, but not better, methinks.

I wonder if I went for the regular Uniqlo merino sweaters (100% wool), if I would have less issues.  or if I should move up to a different brand, like Polo Ralph Lauren, it would be sturdier. or if I should just switch to cotton

text:Everyone‚Äôs opinions on Youtube fashion channels?	labels:One of few Youtubers I follow is Safiya Nygaard, mainly because her fashion videos tend be very well thought out. She actually does the research on the history of styles and trends, provides insight on why certain things were worn and what they inspired, stuff like that. She has her own very distinct style, but clearly enjoys learning about new and different things. She tries out alot of fashion-related things but is really informative about them, and not doing it just because she can. Videos of other Youtubers that I've tried to watch, seem to focus alot more on the "haul" and materialism aspect which isn't necessarily bad, but bores me. Some of them actually have interesting items or outfits, but they don't go beyond "hey, doesn't this look cool" or "hey I got this thing everyone else wants".   Safiya is also hilarious, and her interactions with her now husband (who shoots the videos) are so wholesome!

I've tried following youtube videos, but there is so much ground to cover and it's hard to find someone teaching fundamentals. Like I don't really know how to curl my hair, or style it anyway beyond brushing it and putting it up in a pony tail.

As a dude with an odd shape, big ass and thighs while having short legs, they fit really well without being too loose.      My only problem is I feel ethically wrong about wearing these pants, as they're made of 65% polyester, and washing them releases microplastics into the water. I'm trying to move my wardrobe, eventually, to being mostly if not exclusively organic materials like cotton and wool.     Does anyone know of any pants/work pants that have a similar fit to them, but might not use as much polyester/are 100% cotton?
text:> move my wardrobe, eventually, to being mostly if not exclusively organic materials like cotton and wool.   I've done the same. I really like the "Andrew" fit of vintage Polo Ralph Lauren pants, you could maybe start there. I also picked up a whole bunch of Patagonia flatfront chinos (don't know the exact name) that remind me of Dickies work pants, and fit similar. They're my go-tos now. Both options are 100% cotton.  You could also look into [military surplus pants](https://www.asmc.com/moleskin-pants-olive-green), in my experience they tend to have the kind of fit that works best for you and me, some of them are cheap poly-cotton blends but the ones I linked are pure cotton. Just gotta always check. Good luck to you!  edit: and for washing polyester clothing, I put mine into a [Guppyfriend](https://en.guppyfriend.com/) bag, they are easy to use. But over time I am actively trying to phase out of owning any plastic clothing, just like you.	labels:Thanks so much, this is a great answer.

And I understand why, but it‚Äôs not something in my budget so I have to resort to ‚Äúfast fashion.‚Äù
text:it sucks because so many of us are in this boat, and we're essentially saying "someone (actually, a whole system of someones) has to be a slave and live in poverty so that I can have enough new leggings" which is ... really horrible, to say the least. even worse, many brands are prohibitively expensive for the consumer and STILL don't pay their workers fairly or source sustainably.   I know the consumer isn't the end-all-be-all of brand's decision-making, but too often people just shrug and buy slave-made clothing because they "have" to. the whole system (and our expectations of it) could use radical change, but ofc that takes more than just changing where you shop.	labels:Totally agree.

text:why are men's clothing generally not as expensive and better quality?	labels:I don't know why people think they can't find 100% cotton and other natural fibers in fast fashion stores. Zara, H&M, sometimes Mango and others all carry these items.   I avoid polyester in a lot of item categories and have never had issues shopping at these stores. I don't find that there are differences in price or quality. In fact, the men's clothes are sometimes more expensive, because there's more fabric that goes into it.  I have plenty of cotton sweaters, they weren't more than $30. Sturdy 100% cotton jeans are super easy to find anywhere. Tons of 'basics' like t-shirts are cotton. In the summer, a lot of the stuff is cotton and linen - dresses, shorts, shirts, etc. All my winter coats are 50%-75% wool - all from fast fashion stores.   All this stuff also lasts for years, you just have to take care of it just like more expensive clothes and not treat it like shit just because it was cheap.

text:There is no unmarked woman	labels:I think a lot of those "20 classic items" lists are in part attempts to create unmarked women.
text:They‚Äôre definitely not unmarked. They almost to a tee are or try to signal: middle to high class, eurocentric style, a judeo-christian inspired modesty in color range, tightness, cuts and visible skin but also a western opposite trend for ‚Äútastefully‚Äù using sexyness as a body feature as a signal for ‚Äútaking care of oneself‚Äù. What ai mean by that is an attempt to hint at a relatively thin, hourglass, tall body. Not flaunted, that would be seen as low class or ‚Äúethnic‚Äù but also not hidden, that would be seen as sectarian christian or muslim modest. Overly generous sexual markers like big boobs and big butts need to be de-emphasized. But straight waists need to be made to look cinched in and fat rolls hidden. High heels to elongate but flat if particularly tall.	labels:Well I didn't say it was a successful attempt... nonetheless I think it is often an attempt by the women who put those lists together.	episode_done:True

text:What‚Äôs the occasion?    Those are all pretty casual shirts and I don‚Äôt really like the idea of wearing a tie with any of them.   *Maybe* you can wear a tie with #1 or #3 but I would make it a  very casual tie like a knit tie with a square bottom.  I would start with a navy tie because it‚Äôs probably the most versatile.  [jcrew factory ](https://factory.jcrew.com/p/mens-clothing/ties_pocket_squares/ties/knit-tie/33077)  If you want to wear a tie casually then I suggest buying some OCBDs with substantial collars.  This will retain the casual look you‚Äôre currently going for but they will pair much better with ties than your current shirts.   If you want to wear a tie more formally then buy some proper dress shirts. That would be accompanied by some proper dress trousers, or possibly a suit.	labels:	episode_done:True

I've also dabbled in etsy jewelry a little bit (under $30 range). I know everyone has a different idea of "quality," but I've been extremely impressed with the quality I've received from both amazon and etsy. It is definitely a step up from the jewelry you could get at Target or even Madewell.  I look for gold-plated or gold vermeill (also gold plated but it is plated over silver instead of other metals) since my budget is pretty tight. I started by buying a few different sized gold hoops, plain gold layering chains , and a few rings. I occasionally wear silver but I already had quite a bit accumulated over the years and find myself reaching for gold more often these days. I hope to be able to invest in fine jewelry someday, but what I can find on amazon or etsy in my current price range checks all the boxes for me.

Which websites should I look into? I would prefer not to spend a fortune on clothes but at the same time I don't want to wear garbage quality stuff :) The general style I'm going for I guess is pretty colourful, 90s inspired but with a modern touch?

text:1) overhaul your wardrobe slowly.  Learn what works for you. Trying to do it all at once will likely result in a lot of wasted money.  2) those sites are all pretty low quality. I recommend avoiding all of them. If you want to buy high quality clothes at low prices then the best thing you can do is learn how to shop secondhand at places like eBay, Grailed, Poshmark, and local thrift and consignment stores.

I recently scored a secondhand Little Liffner bag in sky-blue embossed leather; I'm excited to wear it in the spring with tonal browns and creams or with clashing shades of bright blue and purple. I also have a few fun vintage handbags, and I've always coveted smaller bags by Wandler, By Far and Mansur Gavriel‚Äî$$$ though!  If there's a lot of stuff to carry (like a big notebook and a change of shoes or something), I'll carry a separate bigger bag, like a canvas tote or an attache case.

text:For those who actually MISS clothes/makeup/getting dressed up.	labels:I honestly miss it so much. I miss getting ready to go to school, work, or hang out with friends. I sometimes where makeup when I go out but I'm wearing a mask so it's like no one will see my lipstixk or lipgloss and foundation transfers a bit onto it.

text:How do you dress for the (extreme) weather where you're from?	labels:Israel here. 100-120 degrees in the summer, with 80-90% humidity. Sleeveless everything if you don't want to drip sweat constantly, or choose fabrics that are 100% natural and are very airy.   Open toed shoes are acceptable even for work (not flip flops, though, more like dressy sandal heels). Dresses are generally slightly shorter than other places (hit above the knee rather than at the knee or below). Clothes in general are less structured, looser, more gauzy. Men never wear ties, and rarely anything buttoned up in the summer.   With makeup, there are a only few brands of foundation that can hold their ground with so much humidity in the air. Most harsh summer days, I go makeup free, with just tons of SPF on my face and some tinted chap stick or lip balm. If I must wear foundation for an event or something, then it's usually Estee Lauder Double Wear . Other bands I've tried just melt off my face in the heat.  My go-to outfits this summer were knee-length sleevless shift dresses, dress bermudas and dress shorts (yes! even to the office!), fitted light-weight jersey shirts and sleevless shells. Granted, this has been a particularly casual summer what with partly working from home, and the extreme heat due to climate change.	episode_done:True

text:FAQ: Why/ when/ how do you cuff jeans?	labels:**Why:** to make the hemline higher, to provide a visual break between your pants and your shoes (useful if they're a similar colour), or because they are raw denim that will bleed on your shoes excessively if you don't. I suppose some people also cuff in order to flex the selvedge ID, but why condemn yourself to a life of fruitlessly hoping that somebody will notice your selvedge ID?  **How:** idk, you just kind of roll them up. Usually a width of about an inch looks good, but experiment with wider or narrower cuffs as well as with the height of the hem and see what looks good.

text:Let's talk the impact of fragrance on perception of style! How much does a person's fragrance affect your impression of them? Do you choose perfume with this in mind? What are some of your favourites?	labels:It's winter so I'm bundled up and looking like a lumberjack most days, but I like to balance it with fruity body sprays or younger leaning sweet or floral perfumes. My boyfriend bought me Love Spell for Christmas for nostalgia, I mentioned how much I miss drenching myself in it in high school. I alternate between that and Viva La Juicy. In the past I loved Vera Wang Princess because it's just screaming girly girl, meanwhile I'm dressed in plaid, tye dye, ripped jeans, and huge heavy boots. In the summer I dress more feminine and go for unisex or spicier scents, the men's Armani Code was my favorite for years but I didn't reup when I ran out this last time so when the weather changes I'll be looking for something new.   I love a good perfume/cologne whiff while I'm out and about, and I think it takes someone's style to the next level. I do hate when people use so much the smell sticks around for an hour after they leave the area, though. If you're using the good stuff, one spray or drop is all you need!!

I've never asked to rate it from a "traditional" standpoint.  Why would anybody think I'm interested in a "traditional" (whatever that means) scalce if I haven't explicitly state so? Normal people then they go shopping they don't try an outfit on an go "does it look good from an x standpoint?", they go "does it look good (in general) ?".

text:ModCloth Returns to ‚ÄúIndependent‚Äù Ownership	labels:I've wondered about Modcloth for a while. Was a huge fan back in the day but ultimately I don't see them "making it." They might limp along for awhile, in the way that, say, Aeropostale does, but their days of cultural relevance and meaningful profitability are probably over imo.  They pulled a Ron-Johnson-at-JCPenney tier switchup: they dumped the majority of their customers without new customers rushing in to fill the gap. They lost a lot of their core customer base when they were bought by Wal-Mart because the reason a lot of people shopped there was their partnerships with small indie brands; once they stopped being the face of small business and stopped carrying small indie designer merchandise, those people went elsewhere.   Also, while they had gone hard with their twee, indie, retro-repro image and it had been very successful when those things were in style, it had typecast them as that kind of store. So when trend chasers started drifting away from that style and therefore Modcloth, they simultaneously didn't keep up with trends to continue to be a trendy staple for those customers, and also didn't retain enough of their core aggressive twee/retro-repro aesthetic to retain customers for whom that was their primary style.   That said, I do feel like there's a big gap in the market for alternative clothes and accessories at approachable prices that Modcloth could step into to some degree, using the retro-repro look as their point of entry. With Hot Topic having gone full fandom and Dollskill seeing a mass exodus due to the owner's consistent offensive comments, I feel like tons of people in the sweeping alternative fashion community (and not just goth/punk, but rockabilly, Western iterations of japanese street fashion, "e-girl" fashion, "witchy," vintage repro, etc.) are looking for a new aggregate store. Modcloth already has or has had partnerships with a lot of brands like Stop Staring, Pinup Girl Clothing, Folter Clothing, Hell Bunny, Steady Clothing, etc. which are on the "edgier" side of vintage reproduction and while I don't think Modcloth could really venture into the festivalwear/clubwear spaces that HT/DK occupied without a total rebrand, there's still a lot of growth potential for whoever wants to fill that "approachable alternative" niche. They pseudo-referenced something similar in the article so hopefully they've got their eye on that market.   ETA something that ModCloth had incorporated that made them a go-to spot was their review system! Thought it was interesting that wasn't really addressed when they talked about returns--that was really groundbreaking back in the day when it was implemented, too. Also, something that has also been consistently appreciated has been clear stock imagery, shown both on a mannequin and on a human body, often diverse body types too. Hopefully that isn't impacted.   edit: spelling

text:Overhauling my wardrobe with lasting pieces	labels:Brands can have multiple styles that they sell that can go many different ways, so just recommending brands may not be the best idea. Lots of brands sell some pretty hideous things too.   If you want to start finding good value items, which it seems like is your goal, go used or vintage. Look at places like thrift stores and sites like Etsy and eBay. You‚Äôll be spending a lot less and can find pretty good deals from time to time. You‚Äôre going to make mistakes and not wear everything you buy, so start small and go from there.   The point on ‚Äúoutlasting‚Äù, it matters far more how you take care of it. Think of it like a car, if you drive it 100 miles everyday and rarely take it in for service or just let it rest, it‚Äôll wear down pretty fast. But if you take that same car and drive it twice a week for 20 miles, keep it in a garage, do your preventative maintenance, it‚Äôs going to likely look great and drive better in 10 years even if it‚Äôs a piece of junk.   My suggestion is to rotate if you want things to last. Don‚Äôt wear the same pair of shoes everyday, let them take 24 hours to breathe and air out. Give them the care they need. Same goes for jackets and other clothes. Two pairs of cheap boots that are taken care of will likely last longer than a pair of expensive boots that are worn till they crumble apart.  Quick edit: luxury does not mean it will last. Many luxury items are made of fine fabrics that are not as durable as cheaper versions or similar.

text:Fall/winter shoe trends: what's your dream wishlist?	labels:Ever since I watched mad men, I‚Äôve been dying for a pair of white go-go boots but I can‚Äôt figure out how to make them work without looking too costume-y!!!

text:What inspired your passion/love for fashion?	labels:In all honesty, I was very resistant to the idea of dressing fashionably for myself because of how my older sister and I were compared against each other. AKA she was the popular social butterfly with the model looks and I was the tomboy bookworm. That dichotomy plus the competitive misogyny I grew up internalizing probably should have led to us being embittered rivals, but thankfully that never happened. Circumstances led us to learning to appreciate each other pretty early on, but the habit of dressing up in hand-me-downs from male family friends 5 years older that I kept ruining stuck. It wasn't until high school that I started visiting Taiwan and shopping more (namely at Zara)!  All the way until high school though, I still *loved* fashion. I was obsessed with video games like Kingdom Hearts, DDR, and Final Fantasy and anime series like *Cardcaptor Sakura*, *Rurouni Kenshin*, *Cowboy Bebop* early on. The character designs, a love for drawing, and lots of DeviantArt/Tumblr just led to me coming up with my own designs that I'd love to wear and try to mimic (with very little success lol).  High school was when I first started really paying attention to fashion designers like Alexander McQueen. Seeing these dresses ([1](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/05/03/fashion/03iht-fmet03-inline1/03iht-fmet03-inline1-jumbo.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale), [2](https://blog.metmuseum.org/alexandermcqueen/images/5.McQueenRed,VOSS2001.EL.jpg), [3](https://blog.metmuseum.org/alexandermcqueen/images/12.McQueenSp2007SarabandeFlowers.EL.jpg)) made me fall in love with the drama of these bold and beautiful designs. Of course, I couldn't afford any of that and instead defaulted to what I call a pre-dark academia/prep style complete with faux suede blazers and  silk scarves. The idea was there, execution not so much.  When college rolled around, I was very much into the idea of beautiful party dresses and sleek professional wear because... I was an adult! I wanted to feel grown-up! Now, I have abandoned the sleek professional wear but have kept true to my penchant for beautiful dresses.  My wardrobe basics are all there, so I've finally begun branching out into those wonderful, interesting designs that I loved so much since I can finally afford them. I've always viewed fashion as an artistic form of expression, but wasn't convinced that my body was the appropriate canvas. Now, my style is a lot more free, eclectic, and daring than it has been in the past as I truly gain confidence in how to dress myself.  Funnily enough, my friends will roll their eyes at how "bougie" I am... which then, I can only point to my sister and mom. Compared to me, their tastes are stratospheric üòÇ	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 08, 2020	labels:Hello. So I am a 24 year old male, I am 6 foot about 3/4 inch and weigh about 168 pounds.. So on the skinnier side. And have chicken legs for calfs and not much better for thighs..   I wear joggers everyday.. Though it is really hard to find ones like. I want to just get one pair that I can wear everyday and be done with searching..   I want them to be really nicely tappered.. Quite skinny(dont have to hug the legs like girls leggings though, but deff skinny from waist to ankle)..   I want them to be really good quality(price isnt a concern) so they can last for everyday use and sleeping as well. Also good quality and durable because I dont want them to get fagged out/ lose there shape.   This happens to ones I have when I sleep in them and I wake up and they are all baggy by my knees/thighs.. Also even just wearing throughout the day can do this.. Then i have to put in washer then drier to "snap" them back into shape..   Also I want durable one so the pockets stay fit and dont get sloppy, especially because I'd like to put my phone and e cig in the pockets, and wouldnt want them sagging(e cig can be heavy)..   I would really like them to be ones where it does not show my penis print at all, literally so hard find ones thay dont.. and it's not because im self conscious. Just seems so weird talking to my mom and dad with a buldge hanging out.  I would like ones with cuffs on the bottom instead of bungees.. They can be like 1.5-2.5 inches..  Honestly, for material.. I'm open to any kind.. As long as they meet all the other criteria(for the most part).. I am open to them being anywhere from plain, all one color to any type of design.. let me know any suggestions for this criteria! Thank you!

text:FAQ: Why/ when/ how do you cuff jeans?	labels:Usually depends on the footwear in my experience.  For example, if I'm wearing high combat boots, I'd rather show off the boot instead of them being covered up by the jeans/pants... so in that case, I'd cuff. In this case the cuff reinforces the whole military vibe as well, so it definitely works.  I can also see the same argument being made for [derbies worn casually](https://i.imgur.com/qPZDDIp.png) with cropped trousers, no/funky socks - I think the cuff makes the overall fit feel much casual than the individual parts.   Sleek boots on the other hand, I feel a cuff would detract from their sleekness. So in this case, I prefer stacks (see: SLP look), or [no break/cropped look](https://i.imgur.com/kCWLvXb.png) (again, depends on the boot - especially the heel height and toe shape).	episode_done:True

text:Sage de Cret Fall/Winter 2020	labels:About Sage de Cret from [NoManWalksAlone's description](https://nomanwalksalone.com/makers/sage_de_cret)  > Sage de Cret is a brand that has existed in Japan since 2001, but only made their international debut in 2013. It is the work of director Kimitoshi Chida, and resulted from his desire to create something tasteful using meticulously selected and treated fabrics in Japan. The brands name is a combination of the two French words ‚Äúsage‚Äù and ‚Äúdecret‚Äù, meaning sensible and decree, and it quickly becomes apparent that these two concepts permeate the collections.  > A large focus throughout each season is that both the roles and the details of all garments are well thought out, and this comes through when you look deeper than the initial inspirations that seem to come from the military and traditional dress clothes. We love the attention to detail given to things like an unstructured blazer that is finished by washing the wool to give it a rumpled texture, or a classically cumbersome coat like a duffel being made up in stretch fabric with mesh sleeve lining for ease of movement. It‚Äôs this thoughtfulness that reminds you that K. Chida isn‚Äôt just rehashing the same staples, but improving them in his own particular vision.	episode_done:True

text:For those who define their style as "classic-traditional" (tailored, fitted, matching, sleek), what are your typical outfits for work, on the weekends, date-night, running errands or lounging around?	labels:I've been loving rompers/jumpsuits for their balance of comfy and slightly dressy. Although I could understand if other people wouldn't consider the romper silhouette to be classic.  I wear rompers running errands, lunch dates, etc. with pointy suede flats or occasionally booties. But they can also easily be dressed up for date night with a pair of heels and jewelry. The key is choosing a style that shows a cinched waist, [like this Jackson Rowe romper.](https://images.app.goo.gl/PH66nhKdRuuBsVyb8). It looks like this style has been discontinued, but it's been one of my summer go-to's.   However, I admit that my day-to-day style has gone more "athleisure" than I've cared for during quarantine (think: leggings or joggers, viscose v-neck tee or a fitted tank, long-line open cardigan or leather jacket), *clean* sneakers.	episode_done:True

It looks like [this](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/415Do1rY%2BPL._AC_.jpg). I couldn't bring myself to pay full price  75-80% off was a no brainer.  The picture doesn't do it justice. It runs really small but once you figure out the right size, the tailoring is very flattering, very warm, and just takes everything up a notch (I style it with a big broach on the lapel usually).

I'm doing it for *me*, you know, because feeling sexy while I'm all by myself is much more important than being comfortable. Sure, it's easier to get coffee and cheeto stains out of my bathrobe than a 100% wool dress, but cheetos aren't sexy either.

text:Advanced Fit Pic Techniques	labels:#Apereture  Usually I shoot wide open like f/4 or lower.  Pretty much anytime I'm shooting a person, I do it wide open.  I understand the idea of shooting at like f/8, cause everything's at the same basic distance, but i've found lower aperture isolates the subject better.  #Focal Length  I shoot everything at 55mm prime (on a cropped, so like 30mm on full), cause I pretty much only use that lens these days.   #Background  I shoot [against](https://imgur.com/eSUeXEI) a [flat](https://imgur.com/btXOTOr) [wall](https://imgur.com/R3hNNek), cause its a good spot in my room and easy and blank and makes white balancing easier and I'm way lazier than i used to be.  Easy way to spice it up is to [shoot](https://imgur.com/0sXViu7) the [wall](https://imgur.com/hY8rYtO) at an [angle](https://imgur.com/7KKJzbj).  Makes some easy leading lines to the draw the eye to the subject.  [colored](https://imgur.com/eimaaQ5) [backgrounds](https://imgur.com/YUHInBZ) are [fun](https://imgur.com/eimaaQ5) and can really [highlight colors in your outfit](https://imgur.com/E64RjV2)  i liked [using](https://imgur.com/jS8cjYz) a [room](https://imgur.com/sbFl3Kb) as a background.  The counter serves as a leading line to draw you into the [subject](https://imgur.com/1n1E5BX).  Same concept with [a corner](https://imgur.com/QjvCGHs), you can use it for [leading lines](https://imgur.com/I6XXpAh).  You can use a [arch](https://imgur.com/o73wdNJ) to frame your subject. [hallways](https://imgur.com/E2dV9G5) or [alleyways](https://imgur.com/I6XXpAh) are good for leading lines and blurred backgrounds.   #Angle  Pretty much do between chest and waist. I leave my tripod at the same height and just shoot.  #Lighting  I hate direct lighting. Too harsh. Plus I really hate golden hour red side lighting.  I prefer overcast if i'm shooting outside for distributed lighting.  But I have been interested [in harsher, angled lighting recently](https://imgur.com/tNuJ4I0). Kinda been something new that i'm experimenting with because thats what the lighting in my room is like.  #Editing   editings hard dude.  I'm not good at it and i do it everyday.  I have filters i like.  [This](https://imgur.com/F8V8X1e) is the [ideal editing](https://imgur.com/btXOTOr) for me recently.  [soft, low contrast](https://imgur.com/qVcPoSs) with a sharper subject (thanks dehaze).   I also like when I shoot with [window light](https://imgur.com/SrqSwZg) to [raise the shadows](https://imgur.com/KUeyHPT) or blacks to make the background darker and highlight the lighting differences.  I highly recommend using selective edits and vignette, I will help locate and highlight the subject very subtly.  As far as color I let the lighting match it so [this](https://imgur.com/R3hNNek) is from an overcast morning so its much bluer, while this is a [bright, fall afternoon](https://imgur.com/qVcPoSs).  You kinda gotta do it a ton of times to learn what you like: i like, low contrast and bright or dark and large differences between light and dark areas. The good news is if you take a fit pic every day you get a lot of practice with different locations and poses and lighting and editing, so take a ton!

text:How would you describe the quality of self-knit/self-made clothes vs. store bought?	labels:To this day, the absolute strongest stitches are hand stitches.  The absolute cleanest finishes are hand finishes.  The most durable and versatile details are hand-applied details. Hell, if you want to go the full way down the line, expertly hand-spun yarns and hand-woven textiles are still astonishingly better quality than modern machine-made textiles.   If you're looking at a $100,000 bespoke suit, absolute top of the line made by the best tailors on the planet, guess what tools that tailor used?  Needles.  Scissors.  An iron.  Maybe a bit of gum arabic or beeswax.   \*Everything\* that makes those garments exquisite comes down the quality of the textiles themselves and the labor of the person making the garment.   The real leg up that the clothing industry is the ability to produce in bulk.  They can buy their fabrics wholesale for a fraction of what us little guys pay at a retail outlet.  They can invest in specialized machinery that does things like seam finishes and embroideries in *seconds* compared to the hours or even *days* it takes to do by hand.  Sure, the quality of these machine-made finishes isn't the *best possible* but in most cases, they're *good enough* for typical wear.  And when you hire people to sew literally the exact same garment hundreds or thousands of times over, that removes the need for hundreds or thousands of drafts, mockups, mess-ups and hours spent head-scratching as you do when you're making a unique garment.     So, when you look at *feasibility* it's pretty clear that mass-production is necessary to make decent quality (but not *best* quality) clothing accessible--*especially* if we value a world where women are free to work outside the home, *especially* if we value a world where the people who make clothing can be paid well for our labor, *especially* if we value a world where *everybody* can afford to be well-dressed, sustainable-dressed, and ethically-dressed, we *need* to utilize the efficiency that mass-production and automation gives us.

text:For the parents of girls	labels:Not a parent.  Growing up, I had a stepgrandmother with a shopping addiction.

The only garmet I specifically remember was a coat from Neiman Marcus from the 80s that my mom said was $50 (then).  (Side note-- I have no idea what we were doing in Needless Markup).  My great grandmother gave my mom money for that coat about 6 months before she died (that is about all I remember about my great grandmother as I was in K when she died).    High school was a battle.  My stepgrandmother had given up on shopping for clothes for us once we hit puberty (her health was also declining) and I was pretty much on my own.  I was the only person in my family to not have a desire to dress like a J. Crew model so I had many battles with my mom (I wasn't preppy enough for her tastes).  Looking at colleges was the worst because they made me dress like something that I am not.  I was secretly alternative in high school and had to hide it (ie changing in the school bathroom).

It gets below 32F here (US South East) often, even down into the 20s & teens.  My clothing currently consists of blue jeans, chinos, and some high top black & white converses. Would love something I could wear with both. I've looked into bomber jackets and pea coats. Not sure what all else I should look into. I know I like fitted clothing rather than bulky. My family keeps suggesting the big canvas carhartt jackets, but they are a bit big and bulky to be wearing with chinos on my way to work.  As far as price goes, I'm not sure what decent jackets/coats (or any clothing for that matter) go for. I'd like to stay under $100 though, but would go a little more for the perfect jacket that would last me a long time.  Any advice would be very appreciated!

They always feel awful to wear for some reason and never fit well. I think they make me look like a slob while I have a decently fit body  Here are some pictures I took wearing the ones I own: [https://imgur.com/a/qn2GGyE](https://imgur.com/a/qn2GGyE)  I've tried wearing it unbuttoned but then it just flaps around like a cape. Rolling up the sleeves is better but they either cut off my forearms or just roll down all the time.  What am I doing wrong MFA? I would like to start wearing these kinds of shirts because I think they look great on a lot of people but just not on me.
text:From the information you‚Äôve provided, these are the recommendations I can give...  1. Your undershirt shouldn‚Äôt be visible at your neckline. Get some deeper v-neck undershirts in grey or a color that more closely matches your skin tone.  2.  I recommend getting shirts with button-down collars. Your collars look a bit sloppy on the one blue shirt I can see. I‚Äôm guessing you blurred out the collar on the second blue shirt because it was borderline obscene.  3. The sleeves are too long. They shouldn‚Äôt be creeping on to your palms.  4.  If your sleeves fall down when rolling then you‚Äôre probably doing it wrong. [options ](https://www.realmenrealstyle.com/how-to-roll-up-sleeves/)  5.  The two blue shirts look like they have some extra material in the back. You can have a tailor bring that in a bit.   Alternatively, you can try tucking them in and wearing a light jacket, blazer, or overshirt. I‚Äôm rarely, if ever, wearing a shirt like this as the outermost layer.  It looks incomplete.  Perhaps that‚Äôs part of what you‚Äôre experiencing.	labels:Thanks for the advice! The blurring was done automatically by some website so I didnt do that intentionally haha.  But I guess there is no way around getting these kind of shirts tailored? I've never done that and never even heard of someone doing that where I live (Netherlands) but I can look into it.  It seems with my body shape (somewhat broad shoulders and narrow waist) off the shelf shirts will never look good on me.

text:Best and Worst Purchase of 2020	labels:Let me preface this by saying this year has been the year of many ridiculous purchases basically my usual travel budget went to clothing.  Best:  -Align Lululemon yoga pants. I have around 8 pairs in a variety of colors and the fact that they don‚Äôt fall down while running or doing yoga and require minimal adjustment is a freaking godsend  -Jeans from Rag and Bone and madewell. After wearing leggings for like 5 months straight I decided I needed jeans that I didn‚Äôt hate and these two brands fit the bill, I love how rag and bone skinny jeans give me an hourglass and pull my butt up and madewell stovepipe jeans pull me in and feel like leggings at the same time  -timberland boots in nubuck. Recent purchase but they fit well and are super warm, also I‚Äôm surprised by how versatile they are. I can wear them with damn near everything  Worst (basically all trendy buys)  -matching Nike terry cloth set in neon orange. Where do I begin with this one...I saw it off Instagram and thought it would be the best WFH loungewear ever...This color is not great for me, the shorts are too loose and the terry cloth snags on everything.  -most of my dress purchases including a high necked pale pink maxi dress that is not only not flattering in cut but also in color (I look like a 18th century matron)  -all of the oversized tee shirts that urban outfitters sells. So these are super comfy so it‚Äôs not that they were all the worst purchase but like I didn‚Äôt need 10 of them. They are literally just very large tshirts and now I own way more than I actually want to wear.
text:I wanted to love stove pipe jeans but when I tried them on, I noticed they bunched around the knees when I walked or moved and I‚Äôd have to constantly pull them down my shins. I returned them, but still wish they would have worked because they were so flattering! Did you have the same knee bunching issue?	labels:I‚Äôve never had that issue!

text:If you could only have one overcoat, what would it be?	labels:For function and warmth: [This](https://process.fs.grailed.com/AJdAgnqCST4iPtnUxiGtTz/auto_image/cache=expiry:max/rotate=deg:exif/resize=height:1400,fit:scale/output=quality:90/compress/https://cdn.fs.grailed.com/api/file/9C7NKzkzTAeuZ5fxOE8O) vintage overcoat I bought secondhand. It's from Haus & Hasselbaum which I'm not sure exists anymore, made from llama wool, raglan sleeves, reaches below the knee, a beautiful caramel color. The weave could be a little bit tighter but it's very warming and shakes off water pretty well.  For aesthetics: my [Trove](https://imgur.com/a/SAqv08u) coat from Japan (also purchased secondhand). I love how sleek the lines on it look especially around the neck. It's a 50/50 linen/wool combo with a cupro lining so I never overheat in it, makes a great Spring/Fall coat for style.
text:I‚Äôm on the hunt for a more spring/fall weight coat that acts as a ‚Äúovercoat‚Äù. That trove coat is sweet, any ideas or recommendations of other ones you‚Äôve seen online?	labels:I got lucky with it! I found it on Grailed, it's rare to find Trove pieces in Western markets  but you could try proxying a new one from Japan, [here's a guide](https://old.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/an3tof/a_guide_to_proxying_from_japan/) on how to do that. (Note that Trove pieces tend to run small)  Try looking for coats that are made of linen-and-wool, linen-and-cotton, or pure cotton as opposed to pure wool, that's the key to a good breathable spring/fall coat. You'll want to stay away from polyester and nylon, because while they may be waterproof they aren't really breathable.	episode_done:True
text:What are your coziest winter finds/essentials?	labels:[Earbags!](https://www.amazon.com/Sprigs-Earbags-Bandless-Earmuffs-Thinsulate/dp/B004RZDC2M)   They are so cute... they basically are a clip on ear warmer. I got them cause my ears hurt so much when it's windy that it gives me a sharp pain and headache after a while. I can use them during running and biking when there is that head wind if a hat is too hot or you can layer them with a hat :)    The banded earmuffs usually applies a lot of pressure to my head over time either from the headband or pressing against the ear or the band against the top of my skull, which gives me a lot of pain and I try to avoid it when I can so this helped with that issue. It's also less bulky. Ya'll prob think I look like a buffoon in em but they're comfy lol  Heavy fleece lined leggings. I recently got some from Aliexpress with this little cat patch on em. They are so warm and were like 9$. I have been wearing them a lot cause I walk by the bay everyday for fitbit steps lol and it gets windy.   I also got the [doc martens](https://www.shoes.com/dr-martens-leonore-faux-fur-lined-chelsea-boot/789236/1691301) with the furryness inside. Im a 37.5 and the 38 (UK 5) was perfect and the leather is quite soft, I wore them today for 4 miles walk without any issues first time and I can see myself using them during my winter walks.  For inside the house, I got the [ugg fluff yeah!](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07V618T5Q) slippers in the kids size 5.

text:What are your most loved ride-or-die winter clothing items?	labels:A parka I got from Target last year. It wasn't even $50, and it's the *warmest* jacket I've ever had in my life. I live in the northeast, where the snow and wind can be brutal, and I was used to spending upwards of $150 on coats that didn't even do anything.  I'm in the process of losing weight, so I figured spending $50 on a winter coat I would wear for maybe two seasons wasn't bad at all. Cue my surprise when I spent a weekend in the Adirondacks last November, where everybody else around me was freezing, and I'm snug as a bug in my cheap Target winter jacket!  I'm hoping come next winter, it'll still fit well enough to be warm, because it's honestly my favorite winter clothing purchase I've ever made.

text:Honestly, I think the peacoat might just be overall a size too big for you. The shoulders are sort of droopy, and coupling that with the sleeve length and boxiness, you might want to look into returning it. Not sure a tailor can fix all that, sorry. Though, the length on it looks really good, so you should definitely make sure that a smaller size wouldn't be shorter in the body. Also, great room design, your place looks dope!	labels:Thanks for the feedback and compliments! I think you are right. Too bad the smaller size is OOS. I like the coat a lot so I‚Äôm trying to make it work. Sucks that I might have to return it.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone have tips on how to find good stuff from Poshmark and other online thrift shopping platforms?	labels:Some really great tips here! Here's my two cents:  1) If the seller doesn't respond to your questions, RESIST the urge to buy anyway. This seems really obvious, but I've made the mistake many times of panic-buying b/c I was afraid I'd miss out on the item, against my better judgment. Someone else may snap it up, but you've saved yourself the headache of wasting money on something that doesn't fit/is damaged/itchy/smells like cigarette smoke/etc.   2) Poshmark and eBay work better when you are familiar with the exact brand and model of clothing. They're not great for browsing due to just too much crap and too much inconsistency in the listings. If you don't really know what you want, I'd suggest browsing TheRealReal. They skew higher-end, but have a quite a lot of choice and have filtered out the trash and no-name brands already. Often you can find really rock-bottom prices for what you're getting (like Rag & Bone jeans for $30). You can search for something like "women's wool trousers" and then filter by size and color and sometimes style (cropped, wide-leg, etc). You'll be exposed to a lot of brands and styles you may not otherwise have thought of. Another pro (or con, depending on how you look at it), is that the clothing sizes are broken down into XS/S/M/L/XL categories, rather than numerical. So if you filter by "S" it will include 26-27 jeans, 34-36 Euro sizing, 40-42 IT size, etc., which is good when you're dealing with international brands. Even better is when the item includes measurements, which they often do, which are always more helpful than a number on a tag. Finally, on full-priced items (except for the really high end stuff), you can automatically get 20% by using their REAL code.	episode_done:True

Suddenly I started cutting the necklines out of my t-shirts and turning them into scoopnecks. I started wearing hand-me-down 80s sweatshirts from my boyfriend's grandma.

text:How would you describe the quality of self-knit/self-made clothes vs. store bought?	labels:In my experience as a knitter for over 10 years, my handmade knits last longer than store bought clothes. With the exception of socks, which I refuse to ever knit again. Those get holes in them so fast that I literally cried because I spent hundreds of hours making them and used fancy ass yarn. Store bought socks for me only.  ETA:  I took some quick pics of my sock situation: Top pic is a handknit sock that started to get a hole, you can see my finger through the stitches. The matching sock had a huge hole at the heel and has already been unravelled to use on something else. Second pic is a comparison between Smartwool on top and my handknit sock using Wollmeise on the bottom. My stitches look huge in comparison to the store bought ones üò¢ [https://imgur.com/a/WEHMRav](https://imgur.com/a/WEHMRav)
text:I totally agree. My hand knit sweaters, kids dresses, etc. have held up super well - even to rough kids wear. But socks - never again - wasted so much time and money and always wear through the heels no matter which heel method I use :(	labels:I don't even understand why store bought socks are so much stronger. I'm guessing the "needle size" they use must be minuscule. I don't treat normal socks well, they go in the dryer and I walk around the house in them. They still last forever and ever!

text:Throwback Thursday: Revisiting our 'Finding A Style and Building A Wardrobe' guide	labels:Thanks mods - I hope this brings some new attention to content that's fairly evergreen.  I wrote this in ten minutes and it's v. rambly, I'll probably come back to it this evening because I think there are some threads to be explored here - a lot of what I imagine/advocate for is what I hope r/ffacj_discussion will someday be, but it's not there yet, and I'll be the first to admit I don't take all of my own advice!  > Do you think any of the advice in this guide needs to be updated?  I think it fails to address what is a pretty large divide (and source of recurring controversy) on FFA: people who want build a wardrobe or improve their existing one to ~\*fit in\*~ v. people who want to develop a deeper appreciation of fashion AND change/improve their style. For the former, it's very succinct and to the point, has decent practical advice, etc.  For the latter, I think it fails to impress upon people who missed out on an arts education the necessity of "learning to see", building a visual vocabulary, a functional grounding in art history etc. Nowadays, moreso than ever, the best designers and collections are highly reflexive and referential, every trend, from the high street to haute couture, is riffing on something or someone that's come before, and having a sense of that makes the experience of going through a collection or breaking down a look to understand how it works and how it came together so much richer and more engaging.   And yes, what I'm suggesting is excessive and elitist and not *strictly* necessary, but the rise of MOOCs and museum publishing arms has made it more accessible than ever before.   > Do you use this advice in your approach to fashion? Would you refer someone > else to it?  No, see above. Right now my favourite recommendations are MoMA's [Fashion as Design](https://www.coursera.org/learn/fashion-design) and the collected works of Valerie Steele, Harriet Walker, and Cathy Horyn.  > Do you think this advice leaves anyone out? For example, is it relevant to a > wide range of body sizes? Does it work for where you live? Does it fail to > take into account the experiences of people of different races, or gender > experiences?   Yes and no? It's generic enough to apply to anyone, but it's a functional, practical approach v. one grounded in theory, and for people who want to really interrogate intersectional aspects of style and fashion, the functional understanding is necessary but not sufficient.
text:It might be impossible, but I always thought it would be kind of neat to create something like a functional use/space survey for wardrobe building. Here's [the kind of survey I mean](https://www.officerenew.com/tips-and-trends/process/three-employee-surveys-improve-workplace-redesign/), it's used a lot when people are redesigning office space. I guess I've seen a lot of wardrobe self-assessment kind of things, but I'm thinking of something that could be more specific that could help with the fashion-as-necessity type questions (and limit the endless answers of "well that would never work in MY office" or "but I live in the midwest so I can't show my ankles without freezing"!  But yeah, I also agree with your point about learning about art/fashion/design. I don't expect everyone to want to learn about art history before they get dressed in the morning, but practicing \~ ways of seeing \~ and how to talk about what you're looking at is really helpful in anything design-adjacent. Like, when people ask questions about how to develop a style, I kind of just want to tell them look at clothes and practice describing it and describing what you like and what you don't like and why, and then try on clothes and do the same thing.	labels:Actually, I feel like "practice describing clothes" would be kind of a fun post!

text:Does anyone invest in real jewelry?	labels:Reddit/America constantly pulls out their "diamonds are worthless" card - which tells me that the majority of Americans actually don't invest in fine jewelry (assuming most people reading are going to be from the US). Investment grade diamonds hold their value.  Jewelry as an investment was typically leveraged by unemployed women who had to find ways to hide money from their husbands. Now that women are relatively more liberated, there are better ways to invest/store your emergency fund.  Solid gold jewelry is really impractical if you want to actually wear it; it's hard to justify 24k gold jewelry when there are better ways to invest in gold as a store of value (or invest in commodities at large as a store of value). Same with fine jewelry in general. It's similar to the "pick three" trade off - do you want investment-grade, aesthetic, and reasonably priced? IME it's extremely hard to find all three and I'm too lazy to go custom.  My every day jewelry is demifine. Gold is 14k and price is like $300+ per piece. I'm not willing to go full fine jewelry prices - 2k for a gold bracelet with natural diamonds that aren't quite investment grade isn't worth. It's like... buying a print vs the original painting, and also answers your question of, "Can the younger generation afford jewelry?" Generally no, but of the ones who can, tastes are changing. 1) The push towards experiences over goods and 2) (but maybe more geared towards the west coast) people would rather buy the latest tech over luxury goods. (How many people do you know who own a $1k+ smartphone or laptop vs people who own a $1k piece of jewelry?)
text:I'm not sure where you got your information from, but 24k is not the only solid gold, and is almost never used for jewelry because it's too soft for daily wear.  18k, 14k, and 10k are all considered solid gold and are all fine jewelry materials that are perfectly fine for daily wear. Solid doesn't mean the karat, it means it's solid alloyed gold rather than gold filled/gold plated/etc.  A $300+ piece would absolutely be considered fine, as it most likely uses solid gold (or platinum) and precious or semiprecious gems. I have a solid 14k gold ring with rubies and diamonds that was about $350. It's of course not a super extravagant ring, but it's fine jewelry nonetheless.  Semi/demifine jewelry would be vermeil, gold filled, etc. and lower value stones like opal or morganite.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Let's talk the impact of fragrance on perception of style! How much does a person's fragrance affect your impression of them? Do you choose perfume with this in mind? What are some of your favourites?	labels:There's only one person who wears a perfume I don't mind, and that's a woman in my office who makes her own perfume. The first version was giving one of the people in our office headaches, so she changed up the components and that solved that problem. For me, most perfumes trigger headaches at best, and migraines at worst, so I avoid people who wear perfume. It seems like perfume has become less prevalent in recent years, and as far as I'm concerned I'm thrilled about that since it's difficult to avoid scents as a health trigger.	episode_done:True
text:What's on your 2021 fashion wishlist?	labels:I'm usually not too fussed about finding & defining a cohesive aesthetic, but this past year I've hit my groove with a sort of maximalist-edgy-preppy-troubled-son-of-a-New-England-scholar vibe. (Think Rowing Blazers meets The Ragged Priest.)   I've become really obsessed with rugby shirts, but I can never find any for women! I wouldn't mind wearing men's rugbies (and I've found some pretty cool ones), except that I'm reasonably busty and men's cuts never fit properly on me.

text:What did people *actually* wear in 2000's?	labels:From 2001-2005, clothing I wore as a high schooler/college kid: low rise bootcut jeans, fitted graphic tshirts, fitted polo shirts, fitted shirts in general (shirts were so tight- maybe that‚Äôs why we layered??), always layering shirts- and shirts were super long and over your hips, but tight- never tucking them in, cutoff denim skirts, cotton shorts (like soffees) with words on the butt, necklace with my first initial on it, platform flip flops, dresses with Hawaiian prints (like flowers or surfers etc), hoop earrings, fitted hoodies. That‚Äôs what I can remember.
text:> fitted graphic tshirts  does anyone else remember the trend from 2002-2005 or so where all the graphic tee shirts had fake businesses on them, with logos and slogans and illustrations and everything like one would a real ad? i saw it a handful of places but remember it most vividly from abercrombie and comparable stores at the time like hollister & aeropostale.

text:Changing Your Habits: Deciding to Not Shop Brands for Ethical or Other Reasons & Following Through	labels:Thank you for posting! I wish this was what the other thread had been about!  I've basically stopped shopping fast fashion......... except when I do. It's really, really hard to escape. But I would say that my fast-fashion purchases have decreased by about 70% in the past few years. I don't think I have a specific example of a company so much as just a general reckoning with the waste and morality of fashion as a whole.   I fortunately came to fashion too late in life to really feel any kind of affinity for any particular brand - I kind of just shop by silhouette and what I think looks good. I do try to shop "ethically" (which I'll be the first to admit is the funnest term to jerk on, but hey, the limits of the human language), and like OP, my formula for doing so is kind of subtraction by addition. Rather than thinking about NOT buying certain brands, I instead focus on things I do want to support - artists I like who would really benefit from my support and are working outside major retailers. A lot of times that means significant grey area - for example, I've been buying a lot of band shirts recently to help support musicians who've lost all their touring income, but the tee shirts themselves are certainly not made ethically. I also buy almost all my stuff secondhand now.... but as we've discussed on FFA before, the culture of fast fashion is what has enabled a satisfying secondhand experience. So that's a little ethically murky, too.  And then there are times when I completely fuck up because I'm only human. This week I went to a bookstore, and there was a Lululemon (which has a storied history of ethical issues) next door. I went to "poke my head inside" and walked out with $350 worth of stuff. I'll always feel guilty about purchases like that, but also, everything I bought has been exactly what I need for working from home, is incredibly functional in my wardrobe, and I didn't have to spend weeks scrolling through ThredUp to find things that are "good enough." But don't worry - I still feel guilty about it!  The one brand that I really had to break up with is Kat Von D's makeup, which worked great for me and, ironically, is ethical in that it's vegan and not tested on animals (I dumped them because Kat herself is a monster). It wasn't that hard to let go of because there are plenty of other counters at Sephora, but there are some products I still haven't really found a great dupe for.  I will say, all this became much easier when I got a great job last year that 10x'd my salary. Before that, I had fewer options (although living in a big city made thrifting more viable than it would be elsewhere).

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- October 19	labels:So, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10‚Äù (enough with the condolences already.. I‚Äôm married).   I have a new pair of Blundstones, and I want to be able to wear them properly, but 28 length pants don‚Äôt really high water on me to make the pull straps visible enough.   I feel like it looks weird with the pant cuffs tucked into the boot from a front facing angle. The cuffs come untucked when I walk, which is irritating AF. I try to roll the cuffs, but I have to roll them up pretty far... and that feels weird too.   Is this happening because of my height issue? I don‚Äôt really want to alter any of my pants or jeans. I don‚Äôt really have the money or time for that.  Would rolling up the pant cuffs really look as weird as it feels? Guess I‚Äôll need to link in some pics later..

text:The only difference between that used Clarks and the new one with the sole you don't like is the metal eyelets on the new one. Both have the exact same sole, the used pair just has a dirty sole. The new pair will look like that within a few weeks of regular wear.  Both soles are made of crepe... which is crap for durability and might as well be ice skates in rainy and snowy conditions.  Honestly, I'd go with the Frye shoe out of all those options, especially with the rubber sole over the leather and crepe soles for Canadian winters, but your selection suggests you'd prefer a boot.  That said, I don't know what you mean by semi-formal. None of these are really appropriate for wearing with a suit. The Frye is passable for that. But the boots are all like jeans/chinos and a flannel shirt type of formality.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:"Can people just hate fashion again" - Synecdoche When Talking about the "Industry" Discussion	labels:Go to the end for **TL;DR**. I'm not gonna lie, this is very tacky because it is kinda classist, condescending, and glutted by nostalgia.  >**There are immensely talented people around but I feel huge vortexes of them are sucked into this mediocre world where nobody criticizes and it‚Äôs all terribly politically correct. Even journalists are the same. You now hardly get a bad a review. In their mind the journalists are supporting the industry, so they don‚Äôt want to dish it. For me it‚Äôs that banality of what is youth.**  LOL. Girl if you want to see criticism, get out of the ivory tower and go on the internet where the people actually are giving lots of legitimate critique and investigation of fashion. You have to be patient and willing to sift through tons of crap, but I still maintain that you are being insanely nostalgic and therefore condescending to today's artists and fashion community. There are new ways to communicate with people and you need to put in the time and the effort to find them. As for the banality of what is youth? The fetishization of youth, as well as the critique of its perceived banality, is present through all of human history. Are you fucking kidding.  I do not think accessibility to fashion has diluted its creativity. It's just that the masses didn't have buying power so they were ignored; now people are shocked the masses are buying things that are supposedly exclusive and innovative and sought-after by the upper classes, who we are taught to desire to emulate by every facet of society. same type of dumb as when alexander wang had parties where he gave away clothes and was shocked people were grabbing as many as they could take. Totally disconnected and kind of embarrassing for him imo.  >Is preserving a house's brand more important than designer creativity?  It depends on the house. Alexander McQueen? probably, yes. And even then, I don't think it really matters since we've all realized at this point what he did can't be replicated. I wish his house as more of a playground for different designers to try new things. Chanel? Chanel's whole brand is making women her definition of palatable and largely inoffensive for the male gaze and society. So, no, as long as the exquisite craftsmanship that she prided herself on is still there. I also think this is a trick question because what you are really asking is "Should what a company makes be decided by the artist or the consumer?" And we both know for art to really sell, the designer has to communicate their art to the consumer very well. The decision to be subservient to the original founder's vision is up to the staff of the establishment. I also get the vibe that it is often the older artists or board members who impede the creativity of younger hires, rather than younger people failing to be creative. One of the ways youth express and react to newer ideas is by responding to trends in their own clothing, regardless of how much or how little they think about it. So I think Wilson's distaste of younger designers and students responding to trends is short-sighted, misguided, and kind of shooting herself in the foot. She's sort of just admitting she's unwilling to investigate newer methods of communication or thinks she fully understands them. She's just being impatient with the people she's gonna rely on one day.  &#x200B;  >While this post is long enough as it is, I do want to bring up one more thought around how we perceive things in reference to when we experience them. A "today's music sucks!" argument. What I remember of past collections are only of the ones that stand out, obviously I forgot the ones that didn't, and so I can have a certain feeling towards the 2009 spring/summer RTW collections because I only remember the best. But when presented with all of the collections of 2009 today, not just the hits, would I have the same feeling?  This paragraph and phrasing are an absolute mess. You're basically asking, "Are me and this woman riddled with nostalgia for the fashion industry?" And yes. Yes you are. This lady is very much that and she is devoid of interest in terms of constructively carrying over the things she finds meaningful. Is she unwilling to confront the things that meant a lot to her might not mean as much to the next generation, as she did to the generation before her? Also yes.  Feel free to reference my comment I made about the history of the incorporation of pants into womenswear elsewhere in this thread in reference to this question.  &#x200B;  >Should spaces & industries for fashion lovers, clothes lovers, and people that have to wear clothes be completely separate?  You gotta be more specific. like, do you have to have cut at least 3 original patterns to get into the first group? Do you have to be a patron of the arts? And if so, do you not realize most patrons are incredibly tacky and lots of them are just glorified clothes lovers or consumers, but yet the spaces for the artists would be impossible without them? Are we just having a bohemian meeting in the back of a tailor shop? The last one sounds pretty appealing imo. But it just sounds like you're asking if we're a rectangle or a square.  &#x200B;  >Do you think that everyone can be placed in those three groups? Would you add more, less? How would you define each? How would you identify yourself?  I think these groups are pointless and fail to effectively address what you want to address, which is basically the difference between people who are "highbrow" in their sense of "art". How could I be a fashion lover without being a clothes wearer? What kind of pretentious litmus test will I be subject to before I am allowed to rub elbows with someone who designs for gucci, a house who's current work I hate? But are they held in higher regard than someone with no sewing or design experience who's outfit choices are highly original? How is that person judged, and who by? What if someone doesn't know shit about the history of fashion, loves clothes, and wears them in an original way? How you categorize them?  >If I said "Lets talk about fashion!", what would that mean to you? (Would you start talking about style, runways, designers, other?)  It means whatever you make it mean when you start the conversation. It can be houses, trends, trend analysis, fashion history, garment construction, color study, or a legitimate study of sociology through the lense of trends and the growth of different houses throughout history. NGL the last one is my personal favorite.  **TL;DR:** I think the real conversation is basically about the integrity of art and consumerism, which isn't really stimulated in the way it needs to be by these relatively vague questions that don't address consumerism beyond feebly attempting to separate it from "true art". Fr some of this post comes off as "should poor people be allowed to buy designer clothes? Because then the burden to cater to anyone but the extreme upper classes who can fund lots of creativity will be taken off these poor oppressed highly profitable fashion houses uwu". Like do you not want people who don't present a 100 page thesis on the meaning of fashion and history of garment construction to not have access to anything other than h&m? Artists make art, people consume it, and take from it whatever they want to or can.  "sHe ReAlLy DuNkEd oN eVeRyOnE aT CeNtrAl St MaRtiN's" let's be real people who are that snobby about art are always like that because they feel threatened by popular taste and the ever-present fact that they can be overshadowed by something or someone more popular than their own work. It's hilarious that you are impressed by her like that. She sounds very insecure. Love that from someone who says the youth are too thin-skinned.

text:What were the fashion finds that made you cry of happiness?	labels:It‚Äôs funny, I came in to this thread to share the time I found a pair of suede Stuart Weitzman boots in my size in perfect condition for like $25 at a thrift store. I wear them all the time and they‚Äôre still in great shape after like 5 years. Enjoy your 5050s!  Less fancy but still memorable: we had just moved cross country for my husband‚Äôs job and I got an immediate call back from a job I applied for. Like, they called me the same day I applied and asked if I could interview the next day. All our stuff was in transit, and I had been planning to take some time off before my next job, so I had nothing to interview in and a suit is pretty much expected in my field.  I went to J. Crew, Banana Republic, Ann Taylor, LOFT, etc that afternoon and somehow NONE of them had suits in my size. The best I could find was one from Ann Taylor in a color I hated with an inseam that was 5 inches too long.   HOWEVER, I randomly passed a Salvation Army on my way home and decided to check it out. Friends, I found 4 beautiful J. Crew suits in my exact size, already hemmed to my ideal length within like 2 minutes of walking in the door. I‚Äôm pretty sure I actually did cry.   I didn‚Äôt end up taking that job (you will not be surprised to hear that it had very chaotic energy!) but I still have‚Äîand love‚Äîthose suits.

text:What are the pros and cons of dressing the way that you do?	labels:Pro: it makes me look my age, so people take me more seriously. I get lots of compliments from strangers, which I adore.     Con: people assume I‚Äôm wealthy and bougie based on the materials / brands, no sir you don‚Äôt understand, everything I‚Äôm wearing is secondhand. I also tend to wear a lot of vintage, which some people take as an invitation to lament to me about the ‚Äògood old days‚Äô. Excuse me but I‚Äôm much happier living as a woman now than I would be 100-200 years ago, thanks. I also get lots of ‚Äòwow you so fancy‚Äô comments, since I live in a beach town where I regularly see people in sports jerseys at nice sit-down restaurants.
text:Oh, I feel you on all of this. I love a good bargain and most of my clothes are either thrifted or bought secondhand. I like to dress a bit more mature and people think I splash the cash around - charity muggers and street sellers will zoom in on me from fifty yards and run across a street to come and hassle me.   When I was in my early twenties and very into vintage I also used to get a lot of creepy older guys coming over and telling me how much they missed ‚Äòreal women‚Äô and wasn‚Äôt I a good little old-fashioned girl?

I also like the combination of the chunky sole/heel, and the smooth leather that's not grainy and not too matted either.  **So even if it's not top tier quality, does \~$300 represent good value for these shoes?**  Generally speaking, I understand that you should probably buy footwear from a company whose primary focus is footwear. At the same time, I'm personally ok if the quality is good (though not great), and it won't fall apart based on my intended use.  * Note: I'm using these as casual shoes....they won't be used for trekking rigorous muddy expeditions or anything like that  **3\\ Are there any other leather hiking style boots that people want to recommend? Here are a couple others that I've found and aesthetically like, but they're slightly out of my price range**  * [https://www.ssense.com/en-us/men/product/common-projects/black-leather-hiking-boots/5709031](https://www.ssense.com/en-us/men/product/common-projects/black-leather-hiking-boots/5709031) * [https://www.ssense.com/en-us/men/product/versace/black-alpine-boots/5401441](https://www.ssense.com/en-us/men/product/versace/black-alpine-boots/5401441)  I still have plenty of time to return the boots, so wanted to get some feedback before I make a final decision. Appreciate any insight y'all have -- thanks!
text:At the 300 mark you can usually get more out of your money when it comes to shoes. Try Fracap for hiking boots	labels:Yeah over at r/goodyearwelt \-- they recommended Fracap, Diemme, and Danner at that price point.  Fracap has some lovely stuff I might come back for, but not really what I'm looking for at the moment. Danner comes closet to matching the aesthetic I'm going for with the Mountain Pass.  I'm generally not an aesthetic first, quality second person. With other boot types (Combats, Chelsea, Jodhpur, etc.), the selection is so wide there's no need to compromise. I'm just having a hard time finding boots with the same combination as the AllSaints.  EDIT: Oh man these are so close. Almost everything I want, but the chunky soles  [https://www.endclothing.com/us/fracap-m120-alto-brill-commando-sole-boot-m120-vcs-bk.html](https://www.endclothing.com/us/fracap-m120-alto-brill-commando-sole-boot-m120-vcs-bk.html)	episode_done:True

One tip I tell myself all the time - you‚Äôre allowed to get rid of stuff you like. A piece can be pretty, in good condition, and fit, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it belongs in your closet! I like a lot of paintings, it doesn‚Äôt mean I need to have them all in my apartment. You can appreciate a piece and let it go if you‚Äôre just *not wearing it*. Especially if you sell or donate you can feel good about someone else getting use out of something  great.   One other tip - I realized I have too much clothing in general, so I have a two-out, one-in policy. Getting excited about buying a new, well thought out piece def makes it easier to find two things in my closet and be like, sayonara, make way sister.	episode_done:True

text:Is anyone into MBTI? Do you feel like your fashion preferences align with your personality type?	labels:At one point on the INTP subreddit everyone was talking about how they wish they could wear a cape without it being seen as weird. I would interpret the INTP relationship to fashion as a little bit more nuanced than "drab and careless". I think the common theme is that INTPs don't generally care what others think - and so that can manifest on a spectrum from "wears whatever because does not care about their appearance at all" to "wears completely outlandish things because they care about their appearance but do not care at all what others think of it".      As an INTP myself I fall somewhere between the two. Like... I *want* fashion to be a higher priority for me, but when it comes down to it my attitude is more often just "whatever" because social pressure to look good  doesn't register to me nearly as much as it could.
text:Wow. Another INTP here, when I read the title of this post I thought ‚Äúnah, not everything relates to personality‚Äù. But this actually describes my relationship with fashion perfectly. Also I would totally wear a cape if it wasn‚Äôt seen as weird.	labels:	episode_done:True

The only way I‚Äôve found to get hair out of the rug is to get down and scrape it with my hands.

text:What did your mom teach you about fashion/style - and what did she not teach you?	labels:My mom was/is naturally gorgeous and didn‚Äôt wear much makeup, just a little blush and lipstick. She wore sunscreen every day starting at 40 and never ever wore foundation, which she credits for looking 20 years younger than she is at 70. She also had a completely different skin tone and hair texture than me, opposite to the point people assumed I was adopted. So nothing she really knew how to do was applicable. She wouldn‚Äôt let me shave until middle school nor was I allowed to pluck my brows ever (thank god because I made it through the Gwen Stefani brow era unscathed) but other than sky was the limit as long as my fashion choices didn‚Äôt get me kicked out of class...which had happened a handful of times thanks to fishnets and boots.  My grandma and I were the only two in the entire family interested in fashion and makeup and so she took me to the Clinique counter at 12 for my first basic items (almost lipstick, eyeshadow, mascara and blush) and taught me how to apply it. She also taught me how to sew, and taught me how good quality fabric and a little tailoring can make anything look high-end. She was an elegant woman with exquisite taste and I miss her every day.   I never was taught much makeup-wise past the basics...also in the late 90s everyone where I lived just used lip gloss and ice blue Revlon eye shadow anyway, and it was all pre-social media and YouTube so nobody‚Äôs makeup looked that good lol. I learned how to do more complicated makeup looks from a book in my 20s. All serious skincare was learned after 30. I still struggle with hair!   Tl;dr: The most important beauty lessons they both taught me was to be comfortable and confident in your own skin, to wear sunscreen, skip foundation, tailoring is key, to appreciate a thick but ever so slightly groomed brow (way before boy brow was a thing), and how to cook.	episode_done:True

text:How would you describe the quality of self-knit/self-made clothes vs. store bought?	labels:i have sewn for 8 years, knitted for 10. i can't buy clothes or accessories that have the attention to detail that i can achieve with making them myself. i have control over all of the seam finishes, linings, trims, length, etc. i am extremely picky about materials, and its very hard to find quality ones today for a price i can afford. when i wear something that i've made so often that it needs to be repaired, because i made it i care more about it and will spend the time to fix it.   it did take me years and years to become good enough to be really happy with what i made, but at this point it is really hard for me to buy clothes.

Cheap enough to have a few to cycle through, but they for sure wear thin, but the elastic is literally the same after a year of heavy wear and putting them through the dryer every other week or so.  eta: by "for sure" I mean that they are showing signs of getting see through at around the year mark and will probably last me another 6 months. I'm a size medium but I have the large and medium, I'll be repurchasing/replacing with the large when it's time.	episode_done:True

text:What I Like is Not What I choose to wear	labels:\>  I have found that I love more classic and tailored looks but with a loose element (think collared blouses, leather structured skirts, plain white loose tees styled with jeans, tailored pants). I love the way these look on more androgynous looking women.   &#x200B;  Same. But I am not androgynous. Got my tig ol bitties and ass.    But I have found a way to make masculine/feminine work for me. I think a big part of it was becoming comfortable with my own body, and gaining the confidence that comes with age.   &#x200B;  ...being able to afford more expensive/high-quality clothes and shoes helps too.	episode_done:True
text:What rules do you break for your body type?	labels:I have broad shoulders and I've always hated them until trends like puffy sleeve, square/sweetheart neckline and power shoulders trend came in. Puff sleeves make my shoulders look more feminine and cute, and can mask my broad shoulders because there's actually more fabric for my arms. Square/sweetheart neckline always makes me feel more polished and the sleeves don't fall off my frame. Power shoulder (blazers, coats, etc) actually hang off my frame in a really good way????
text:Agreed, the older I get the less I care about looking masculine.	labels:I love rocking an androgynous look. I have broad shoulders and I love wearing blazers. The Christine and the Queens music video ‚Äú5 Dollars‚Äù is my style inspiration.	episode_done:True

I notice most women at the gym usually fit well into their fitness clothing since it is mostly spandex, but most guys don't seem to fit their clothes as well. To me, super tight/compression clothing on guys doesn't look good, and it's hard to find the perfect slim fitting clothes for the gym. Where do you shop for gym clothes and does anyone else have issues with fit?
text:I don't personally bother with looking good beyond looking presentable when working out but for what it's worth, have you tried Adidas techfit? Or basically Adidas in general.

text:General Discussion - January 15, 2021	labels:Am I the only one that doesn't see how the Teddy jacket would give off peaked in high school lettermen jacket vibes like all the lurkers that were clearly bullied by jocks are claiming?  Obviously it's inspired by letterman jackets, but removing the contrasting leather sleeves and not having a TGI Friday's wall's worth of shit stitched onto it completely changes the vibe. I don't know, maybe I just associate it more with rockstar because it's an SLP piece and Alex Turner was the first celebrity I saw a photo of wearing it.
text:The SLP Teddy is minimalist enough to not give off that vibe IMO. I do get that costume-y feel from some of the others I've seen though.  Context probably helps as well. In high school letterman jackets are usually just thrown on top of whatever else someone is wearing, whereas the rest of the SLP aesthetic doesn't align with what most high school jocks would wear.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:How do you handle budget increases when it comes to clothes? (ex. going from student to working professional)	labels:I worked during school and was supporting myself so I always had a budget. After I graduated from school I used Dave Ramsey's baby step program to get my finances in order and pay off student loans. I really recommend this and using the program You Need A Budget to set your first budget if you are worried about overspending.  Today I have an annual budget for clothes of $3k but depending on the year I may spend less. Last year I didn't buy new clothes at all. I also started investing in higher quality pieces and they seem to be lasting longer. I still use online thrift stores a lot to cut down on the costs. I think it helps that I'm no longer chasing trends. There are specific cuts that look good on my body and I tend to buy those only now.	episode_done:True

text:WDYWT ? (Why Did You Wear That?)	labels:Disclaimer: I know the pants aren't sitting right, I swear I got them tailored... maybe I gained weight and the waist just naturally fell below my gut, maybe the tailor did a shit job and I just didn't notice, idk.  [Fit 1a](https://i.imgur.com/8RGqYTc.jpg) \-- to show off the rubinacci tie. My initial mindset was, "this thing is loud, I should just make everything else neutral, right?" And then step two in my logical progression was "oh hey, I have a green / pink / orange pocket square I've been dying to wear, and it's far enough away from the tie that it won't so much *clash* as *amplify the trippy colors all around*." I like the result.  [Fit 1b](https://i.imgur.com/bZ7egm9.jpg). I was doing some test filming for a video for work, and I t hought, "gee, wouldn't it be funny if I did that cliche 'hello there' thing in, like, a domestic tailoring setup? Like, you know, the guys who wear a shirt and tie under their silk dressing gowns?" That's an abstract image I've always been into, but I didn't have a silk dressing gown... So I did this instead. The snifter feels like part of the vibe -- a terrible glass for drinking whiskey, but an excellent glass for fit pics, I think. The video didn't really involve my shoes, so i didn't feel the need to change them. Unfortunately, I don't have a shawl collar cardigan, that would have been better.  [Fit 2](https://imgur.com/a/ulFEDD8). We had some warm weather this fall, and I got this shirt, which I love, very late in the summer. I went for a walk with a buddy and took this opportunity to whip it out. I generally don't love these chinos, but I'm always trying to make them work. Burgundy is a secondary color in the shirt, and I got the brown boat shoes, so I figured this was appropriate against the fall foliage but in warm weather. Nothing to write home about in the end, but it made sense on paper and came out fine.

Wings + Horns or Reigning Champ tiger fleece hoodie. Indestructible material, texture looks great. Nothing fancy, but looks great on it's own with just jeans.   Uniqlo jeans. Amazing quality for its price. I've now own two of the same black jeans and I wear them almost everyday   Uniqlo basic tees. After W+H these are what I wear. Super simple but lasts long for its price and fits great. Soft material.   Engineered Garments wool cinch vest. Very flexible. Can be worn over a long sleeve tee, sweater or even a hoodie. Great for layering   Wings + Horns flannel. Bought a zip flannel from them back in 2010? I'm only getting rid of it now because the sleeves have finally ripped.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 15, 2021	labels:Starting a MFA journey with the new year - I've read through the side-bar posts and am excited about building a wardrobe I enjoy on a daily basis.   Context: I'm a physician and typically in the hospital in Figs Scrubs/UltraBoosts. Outside of the hospital I'm typically in athleisure/gym gear typically Nike 5" inseam running shorts with either short or long-sleeve tops, crew socks, and workout shoes.   I really struggle in the life events between these two most-common scenarios and that's where I'm trying to fill in my wardrobe. I've got some Rhone commuter pants that I really enjoy after having them hemmed and trim-fit Mizzen and Main tops.   I want to start out finding a pair of Jeans that I love and can add to an informal rotation like dates, family events (once pandemic recedes.)   Price range is negotiable, really looking for quality and ease of purchasing/trying on from home right now.   Where should I start looking for jeans that will fit an athletic frame 5'10", 30" waist.
text:If you want ease of purchase/return, you can't go wrong with LEVIS. A ton of different options, probably including an athletic cut. Some people complain about quality but I've owned many pairs of Levi's and they've all served me well.  NUDIE jeans are a personal favourite. They have great, comprehensive sizing info online which can help you pick a model. I don't know about their international shipping & returns though.  A.P.C., NORSE PROJECTS, ACNE STUDIOS, 3SIXTEEN are often recommended at a higher price point but I'm unfamiliar with most of their models. The quality is probably very good.

text:What clothing items have you reverted back to since WFH/quarantine?	labels:I started working from home in February. (Covid outbreak in Germany started at that time.) At first I thought: great! No more business casual for the office required. I can just wear a half-way decent top and no one will see if I wear Sesame Street-PJs under the desk. However, after dressing really, really casual for two weeks, I noticed that this was impacting my work. Somehow working from home felt "less serious" than going to the office and directly interacting with people.  Of course I am also not sitting completely dressed up at my home office desk, but I found a good middle ground for me. I am usually wearing a nice, knee-length dress, black opaque  tights and just minimal make-up like some foundation. This works great for me. Dresses and tights are super comfortable, but I still feel like I am properly dressed. It has been better for my personal work mentality, than working in PJs. (Of course not saying, that this is the case for everyone. Just for me personally.)

text:Inspo Album - Random Assortment of Fall 2020 Trends	labels:I love that Victorian is in. I can‚Äôt get enough of it as an updated look, frilly high necks, pearl buttons, blush and cream silks - I always thought of Victorian as stuffy but the modern takes are so romantic and feminine. Maybe I‚Äôm too used to/over boxy cuts and plain linen?  I also love the longline ‚Äúgrandpa‚Äù check blazers but I‚Äôm afraid to buy one as they don‚Äôt seem like a trend that would necessarily last. I will say I did go out and buy a black turtleneck to wear under my existing blazers (none oversized or long line) and I feel like a proper Beatnik.   I‚Äôm surprised to see puff sleeves get another season, when they first started getting popular, I hated them. But actually the puff at the wrist (*not* at the shoulders) is quite cute and cozy on a thick knit cardy or sweater. Makes me want that snuggly cottage forest look.  Midi pleated skirts are in and I want one... to work on me instead of making my legs look stubby.

I recently have been having a good friend say in a half joking but sad way that she always feels so underdressed around me and has sometimes even started too ask me what I‚Äôm wearing before we hangout. I don‚Äôt mind answering her at all even if I just have a vague idea of what I‚Äôm going to wear if I see it in time. It seems to kind of upset her that she always feels underdressed even though I think she always looks great!  I really like dressing up for things even if it‚Äôs barely anything but I‚Äôd hate to make her feel that way. At the same time however I don‚Äôt want to put more effort in to look more casual then I‚Äôd really want. I question if it‚Äôs more my problem or if it‚Äôs more of an personal issue for her.

text:Skirts and dresses in winter - how to look good and be warm with a combo of boots, socks, tights?	labels:Instead of tights, I usually wear leggings.

I find leggings way more comfortable and warmer than tights, plus more durable.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 15, 2020	labels:I'm sure this varies from place to place, but what are some telltale signs of a good thrift store? Just need some broad or general pointers, please.
text:It depends on your goals.  I thrift a lot and coming up with a generic telltale sign of a good thrift store is hard. Why is it hard? Because everything is a trade-off.   What‚Äôs a good thrift store to me might not be good for you.   Thrift stores in affluent areas will have nicer stuff on average but tend to be smaller, have more pickers, and might have a more knowledgeable staff (so the really high-end stuff is priced accordingly).     Well-organized thrift stores are easier to shop and therefore easier to find the good stuff which means there might be fewer good items left for you to find.    Honestly, the best thrift stores are the ones where you find stuff you‚Äôre looking for. It just takes time and repeat visits to figure out which stores will be good for your goals.

text:Purses: Real vs. Faux Leather?	labels:I personally find leather a creepy (eg, it's something else's skin) but necessary material. I have a few pairs of leather shoes and insoles, and two inherited leather purses that I was gifted. Leather is extremely durable if it's well maintained, and has material properties plastic leather does not mimic. I have my grandmother's coach purse that is well over 50s years old and it looks brand new.   Regarding sustainability, I'm not sure which is better, because it all comes down to what you value, animal kindness vs pollution vs biodegradability. My personal opinion is that buying a few leather purses and maintaining them for your lifetime is probably the most "sustainable" option right now, especially if you can get them from a maker who does low-impact tanning and dyeing.  Personally, most of my bags are furla's candy bon bons, which used to be rubber and are now pvc. But they are actual clear pvc, and not "fake" leather. I bought them before I started focusing on environmentally friendly purchases.However, some are over eight years old and still look brand new. They have lasted a lot longer than my faux leather purses.  You might give fabric purses a try, especially the durable natural fibers, if you don't want a "lifetime" bag. They can be biodegradeable, sustainable, and less expensive. I have a few cute purses I sewed from hemp and cotton, and they are really sturdy and tough if you get a heavy fabric. Not the look everyone wants, but I have gotten more compliments on a simple indigo sashiko purse than anything else I own.   Finally, I see promising things about mushroom and pineapple leather, so I am hoping this question will have better answers in the coming years.	episode_done:True

text:Decolonize Sustainable and Ethical Fashion	labels:While I like what the article is saying, but they are misusing the word 'decolonizing'. Decolonization is not a metaphor.
text:They‚Äôre not using it as a metaphor here though? Decolonization here is referring to the actual colonial structures that underly ‚Äúsustainable/ethical fashion,‚Äù as in the way that (usually Western) companies exploit workers of color in developing, usually historically colonized nations, using systems developed by and for colonizers.  Edit: Assuming you‚Äôre referring to the Tuck/Yang article, I‚Äôd argue that promoting a model of sustainability that is both environmentally conscious and treats workers as people is a form of decolonization that falls within their framework. It‚Äôs definitely not the metaphorical ‚Äúdecolonize your mind‚Äù stuff.	labels:for sure, the reason we are able to consume fast fashion in ‚Äúthird world‚Äù counties is the colonization and subsequent abuse and misuse and stealing of resources, manpower included.

text:How has the quality changed over the years at some of your fav brands?	labels:Definitely Banana Republic and Gap. Their fabrics are thinner and more prone to pilling after only 2-3 wears. Dresses and pants that would have included a lining even a few years ago are no longer lined.  Additionally, the fit of the clothing is awkward and inconsistent. Customers try on two of a specific item in the same size and can easily see a difference between what should be the same item.
text:So with GAP, I feel like they were at their worst 2-3 years ago and are a bit better again now, not how they were 20 years ago but also cheaper than back then so long as you catch a sale. More natural fabrics. Just my two cents. You have to watch what you buy but they've had great sales during COVID. I'll be sad when they split from Old Navy as I often shop together at them + BR online.   BR is definitely worse quality than in the past. But I still find some decent-ish things there. Certainly far from worth full price overall.	labels:Funny thing about Gap is that they use more natural fibers than BR, which has really leaned into its poly blends in the past few years. For example, Gap‚Äôs flannel button-downs for women are 100% cotton  while BR uses a cotton/poly blend that actually even feels less durable.   Plus Gap always has at least a couple of items that are very similar to BR in both quality and appearance, but for a lower price.	episode_done:True

text:What are your feelings on thrifting from ‚Äúproblematic‚Äù brands?	labels:Personally I would be fine with it for me as long as there's not a prominent logo of the brand on the piece.  (I hate "logo" or "branded" clothes, anyways, bc I think they look junky, but that's just my personal opinion - I've been known to cut little logo tags off even brands I like and support, like Patagonia, just because I don't like wearing branded stuff - but I'm weird that way!).  You could even cut their brand name out of the tag on the inside if you really don't like the brand or what it stands for, but they don't make money off you buying it secondhand.  And if someone asks, just say it's something you got secondhand and you don't know the brand so that you're not directing customers their way.  Maybe something like Poshmark indirectly supports the brand (upping it's resale value?  I'm not sure about this...), but if you bought it somewhere like Goodwill or a thrift store, I don't think there's any way it would affect the brand or even its resale value.	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- November 03	labels:Hi there! So, for my entire life I've had super wide and flat feet. I've been wearing New Balance for as long as I can remember because of this, and very rarely can I find another brand of shoe that fits.  A couple of years ago I lost 80 lbs and my foot size changed. I actually dropped down in width, which you think would help, but in reality its made things even more difficult for purchasing. For some reason my left foot feels much bigger than my right now, and my feet fit even more unusually than they used to.  Last year I lucked out and found that Saucony runners actually fit pretty well, but they're not the most durable and are better suited as a summer shoe. A couple months ago I went to New Balance and got the same two pairs I always do, the classic 990s and fresh foam 880s. I went from a 4E to a 2E for both.   After wearing them for the last month or so, I've found that the 880s hurt the sides of my feet which is new, and I can barely get the 990s somewhat comfortable on my left foot.  I'm at the point now where I really don't know where to turn for comfortable footwear. I would love to have winter boots that I don't need to put 3 soles into for them to fit properly, and I can't find any hiking or outdoor style boots or shoes that fit.  Currently I have the Saucony TR12s, the NB pairs, Timberland steel toe shoes, and Echo Sandals. The Saucony hands down fit the best, and while the rest fit, I feel like footwear should fit a lot better and be a lot more comfortable.  Any tips or reccomendations on what to do or try? Shpuls I try other Timberland models? I spend a lot of time outdoors so I'd really like some sort of quality boot, or to find a brand like New Balance that works for me.  Really I just want footwear that fits the way its supposed to. I've tried Merrell, Columbia wide models, $500 hiking boots, and others. I've been thinking of giving Merrell a shot again.  Thank you in advance!
text:I have really flat feet too and I got orthotics since I was 13.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 28, 2020	labels:I'm looking for a sleek, clean aesthetic. A well fitting dark turtlenecks, black jeans, Chelseas and a casual peacoat (not double breasted) would be my ideal outfit.  The problem is, I can't seem to expand much beyond this specific outfit. Anything else I think of just feels like too much color. I'm not a fan of patterns either. Does anyone have any suggestions to expand my wardrobe?

text:If it's single breasted, it isn't a peacoat.  Blazers and cardigans over a turtleneck are cool. Bombers as a more casual layer.  Wool pants play onto the vibe.

text:Review: Church's McPherson Brogue Derbies with Commando Soles	labels:Great review!  Totally agree re: church's, I've got a pair of their cornwood (Chunky Chelsea boots) which I got around 40% off last year and they're brilliant, they're a tumbled leather so have a softer grain to the embossed calf but have held up to my abuse brilliantly. I've noticed that Church's are excellent at the clicking process and only the highest quality hides make it in (in my experience, they're the only brand I've never seen any inconsistencies in leather quality from).   My only complaint is the last (103 as opposed the the 133 on yours), it looks amazing but leaves me swimming at the heel with a relatively stubby toebox.  I agree too about C&J, their scotch grain is softer (and I'd argue maybe a little *finer*) than church's. But Church's firmer leather is not a bad thing for country shoes and is more in line with the Zug grain you see from Trickers.

text:How would you describe the quality of self-knit/self-made clothes vs. store bought?	labels:It would depend on the skill and machinery of the sewist - I have definitely made clothes that I like and will likely keep wearing, but they‚Äôre not the most structurally beautiful garments and are not the same quality craftsmanship you‚Äôd get from a higher end brand. Part of it is equipment - I don‚Äôt have a serger which is used a lot in clothing making - and part of it is I‚Äôm not that concerned about the seams on the inside of a garment that only I will ever wear. That being said, if I had taken the time to do proper seams, there is no reason those garments wouldn‚Äôt last just as long as higher end garments.
text:For sewn pieces the investment in equipment needed to approach commercial operations is feasible for an individual, but in knitwear or complicated embroidery there's just no competition. 3D and digital looms are $$$$ and what a consumer pays for good yarn is a multiple of a large operation.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - January 15, 2021	labels:I got a little book haul in! [Ametora](https://i.imgur.com/CRo5ZKE.jpg), Fashion Drawing: Illustration techniques for fashion designers (Second Edition), The War of Art, and Deluxe: How Luxury Lost It's Luster (yes I bought it based on the Margiela manic quote don't judge)          Michele Wesen Bryant's Fashion Drawing: Illustration techniques for fashion designers (Second Edition) is a real, unironic page turner. This shit has primers on colour theory, pleats, fashion history and in-depth explanations of literally everything related to fashion illustration from posing to garment details to drawing studs and patent leather, there's even some design advice sprinkled in. Don't know why I'm surprised that a real textbook is this informative and well-done.       [They even got a few Peter Do sketches in there!](https://i.imgur.com/8FcG1Fm.jpg)      Raw denim folks made it in too:      "Untreated or "dry" denim" has something of a cult following and is preferred by those who are passionate about breaking in garments to fit their exact form."         Pretty much the whole reason I bough this is I wanted to learn to draw plaid. I now know that I have completely wrong equipment, but at least I understand it in theory. While I do suck at painting and drawing I woulda never thought real fashion illustration is apparently done in *marker*. Guess it's time to get some nice markers.      [ "Rendering yarn-dyed plaids can seem complex at first, but if you take time to analyze stripe-colour, order, and width, you will find it not as difficult as you might think." ](https://i.imgur.com/Fg2tE6N.jpg)        It's pretty easy if you take it step-by-step, might result in something good too if I had proper markers. I was *really* close to figuring it out on my own though.          Might fuck around and work through the whole book, if I can find the necessary art supplies.
text:Those are some nice illustrations! I feel you on the marker thing too, one of my roommates here at uni was a fashion major, it was cool watching him sketch everything out with them. The trick is getting some nice ones like undertheechotree said, Copics or similar brands have much better flow and color than regular markers. You can even do watercolor-esque stuff if you get a blending marker.	labels:Copic is the most famous brand for alcohol-based markers. It's been a few years since I researched it but from what I remember there were very few decent alternatives, all still relatively expensive. A set of 36 copic sketch markers is ‚Ç¨212eur on Amazon DE. Be aware that copic ciao is not the same as copic sketch.  Hopefully things have changed and there are more reasonably-priced options today!	episode_done:True
text:What did people *actually* wear in 2000's?	labels:From 2001-2005, clothing I wore as a high schooler/college kid: low rise bootcut jeans, fitted graphic tshirts, fitted polo shirts, fitted shirts in general (shirts were so tight- maybe that‚Äôs why we layered??), always layering shirts- and shirts were super long and over your hips, but tight- never tucking them in, cutoff denim skirts, cotton shorts (like soffees) with words on the butt, necklace with my first initial on it, platform flip flops, dresses with Hawaiian prints (like flowers or surfers etc), hoop earrings, fitted hoodies.

text:What's your fashion miracle?	labels:I used to wear small diamond earrings every day, and would put them in my wallet when I went to the gym after work. I got to work the next day and realized I forgot to put them back in after the gym, so I opened up my wallet and they were gone. I had made my usual morning stop for breakfast on the way to work, so I rushed to the food cart and looked all over the sidewalk but I couldn‚Äôt find them.  At least 1-2 weeks later I went to the same food cart for breakfast, looked down, and saw one diamond earring in the crack in the sidewalk. I looked more closely and there was the other one! The metal was chewed up (they were bezel set) so I had to get them repaired, but it was a lot cheaper than a new pair!   Definitely my #1 fashion (jewelry?) miracle.
text:That's incredible! I'm a notorious earring-loser, so I never wear nice ones. This gave me so much satisfaction ‚ù§	labels:It was insane that I found them! I still went to the same food cart pretty much every day after losing them, and I would half-heartedly look down, but I never thought I‚Äôd actually find them!

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 14, 2021	labels:Hello again gents,  Back here for another fit check- this time instead of a peacoat, it's this Coach Leather Racer Jacket (lambleather). Bought it at Coach Outlet, it appears to fit well but it feels snug around the shoulders and back, kind of restricts a bit of motion but I hear that the jacket stretches out so maybe I'll soldier it on.  My concerns: - The snugness restricts a FULL range of motion for my arms when zipped up (when unzipped, it's  golden). Also it squeezes my upper arms a bit when I bend flex my elbow but I suppose that should stretch out too... right? - If I gain say about like 10ish lbs, would the jacket continue to stretch to fit? I'm currently gaining a bit of mass. - Is the cut of the length correct or is it not normally supposed to be cut so short?  I'm 5'6", about 130lbs- this is a size XS Coach Leather Racer Jacket. Also I can only fit a thin wool sweater under it and even so, makes it incredibly tight. (but I plan to use it as my spring/fall jacket either ways so that's negligible).  Some picture references (unzipped and zipped):[https://imgur.com/a/qhNI3aL](https://imgur.com/a/qhNI3aL)  As always, I appreciate the help folks :)  Thanks, E.

[This review](https://coatchecking.co/blog/arcteryx-radsten-parka-2020), as well as comments on my post asking about the magnus on the arc sub, has led me to believe that the radsten is just a slightly better magnus.

It‚Äôs helped me feel more productive and motivated. I still miss wearing my ‚Äúeveryday‚Äù clothes, but it‚Äôs a step up from what I was wearing before.  Also, I bought several new cute work clothes 2 weeks before quarantine hit and they‚Äôre just sitting in my closet unworn (didn‚Äôt upset me more than dropping $2k on car maintenance a few days before everything hit and now I‚Äôm not even driving my stupid car)	episode_done:True

text:Handbag conundrum: lesser know (and lesser seen all over the place) or standard luxury designer bags (think the usual Gucci, YSL, LV, etc.)	labels:I have [one nice bag](https://www.wolfandbadger.com/us/zoe-shoulderbag-in-cognac-brown/) from Ostwald Couture and am saving to buy another. The one I have has no recognizable branding but is very well made, light but durable, and rich-in-tone. I love it as a every day bag. The one I‚Äôm [saving up for](https://www.ostwald-bags.com/finest-couture-bags-shop/einzelst√ºcke/circle-tote/#cc-m-product-11245870994) is completely unique and one-of-kind but more a statement bag. I love the color and ‚Äúwave‚Äù texture that it has, with a vibe that‚Äôs both edgy and organic at the same time.  ‚ÄúWorth it‚Äù is totally subjective. For some people, $500, $300 or even $150 for a bag will never be worth it because it‚Äôs too large a sum for them to contemplate spending on a mere accessory. For some people, it‚Äôs only worth it if it has a recognizable brand or look (and associated prestige, style, and cachet). For some people, the aesthetic of the fine design or particular quality/finishing make it worth it.  There‚Äôs no ‚Äúright‚Äù answer to how you spend your money but there‚Äôs a bajillion other factors that you *might* consider besides price - it is your only bag? How often will you wear it? Is it suitable for your lifestyle? Do you have destructive forces in your life like pets or small children? Etc. etc.  At least 90% of the things I own are less than $100, but I do have a handful of more expensive pieces. The ‚Äúpoint‚Äù for me when I make a big fashion purchase - whether it be a dress, a bracelet, a purse whatever, is that occasionally I come across something that just makes me feel like I must have it - I covet it for months, sometimes even years, it just speaks to me.

text:I haven‚Äôt shopped at Lululemon in years (seriously, probably 8 yrs) & I always loved the brand, but fell off the athleisure train.  I went online to order a pair of high rise, plain black, full length leggings hopefully slimming & the product ratings were just so bad that it surprised me and deterred me!  Do you have a specific style that you recommend?!	labels:This question is so subjective! R/lululemon should help you out if you know what you‚Äôre looking for in a legging. Aligns are very popular, I love them they don‚Äôt slide down and are very smooth, however the quality isn‚Äôt as great. Wonder unders are popular too but they come in two fabrics that are very different from one another so you need to watch for that. The ones mentioned above with the side pocket and draw string are invigorates I like these but I find they slide down.	episode_done:True

text:People who used to play super safe with fashion, how did you overcome your fear of bold choices?	labels:I really love fancy clothes but I never have anywhere fancy to go to and I was terrified people were going to stare at me or think i was weird for wearing a fancy dress to get coffee or a low key dinner with friends.  I was telling my boyfriend for the umpteenth time something along the lines of "man I hope we get invited to another wedding soon so I can wear this dress"  he asked why I don't just wear it if I want to wear it.  I explained how ridiculous it would look to wear it to the places we normally like to frequent.    He replied that if I really wanted to, I should wear it and he would dress up too so that I wouldn't be doing it alone.  So that night I got in my fancy dress and heels and matching shoes and jewelry and did my hair and makeup.  My bf dressed to match my level and we went to meet our friends at a local kava bar (very casual place).    I loved the way i felt wearing what I wanted but was terrified people would stare or tease me.  Instead our friends could not stop gushing over our outfits and even said they always wanted to dress up too but didn't want to be the only one and they were happy they felt they finally could dress how they wanted to.   In summation, get a friend who shares your sense of style to try new things with you!!!!  It helps so much to not feel like you're doing it alone.

text:Effortless style - let's exchange tips and tricks	labels:Deconstructing effortless for a second:  when someone looks at a photo of, say, a blogger or model‚Äîwhat compels the viewer to declare:  that's effortless?  Most photos are planned, styled, and selected often from a photo roll of hundreds of shots.  After that, they are typically edited or at the very least filtered before they land on your Instagram, Pinterest, Blogroll feed.  In other words, effortless style probably not indicate the work that went into the photograph itself.  It also probably does not denote the subject of the photograph, since most are professional dressers (influencers, bloggers, models, stylists, celebrities, etc.) to some extent.  So my theory is effortless is what the photo induces the ***viewer to feel;*** but is not in any way indicative of what it is actually like to be the subject of such a photo.     In other words, when I view a photo and I see an outfit I like that I could reasonably afford or mimic without a great deal of ado, I tend to think of that outfit as effortless.  It helps that I am also told that it is effortless in the caption, which reinforces the belief that such a look is reasonably within my grasp.  In fact, the word effortless is a common marketing ploy, used to induce a sense that everything could be just so easy--if you had one more thing.  In that sense, I think there's a reason why there's such a strong relationship between effortless dressing and luxury/premium goods.  Most people have got a white shirt, sneakers, and jeans; but most people do not have a Chanel classic flap.     It's the same kind of marketing ploy used to sell all manner of commodity.  Most famously, it was used to sell dishwashers and vacuums to housewives.  Basically, effortless is the belief that your life, your image, could be so leisurely if you bought just one more thing.  Of course, our lives have not gotten more leisurely since the 1950s, especially if you're American.  And of course, a vacuum doesn't eliminate the need for cleaning, it just makes it slightly easier--well, until the vacuum breaks or needs to be upgraded or you realize that in order for your carpets to be the gleaming white clouds of magazines, you also need to buy a steamer.     But going back to being the subject of the photograph.  What we most often find is that we are not able to look as effortless as the subjects because we don't live in photographs; and also, because we don't have all the time or energy or money to devote to our appearance as these professionals.  We might not be as attractive as them either--not as thin or tall or beautiful.  So then we go back to our closets and go:  why don't I feel effortless?  And the truth is effortless style is not effortless; it's a very specific kind of visual fiction that we're told we could inhabit.     If we tried hard enough.     After all, why do we say effortless and not comfortable or easy or simple or basic?  Why aren't Naturalizer shoes effortless?  Why aren't sports bras effortless?  Why aren't sweatpants effortless?  Pajamas?  When people talk about quarantine style, why aren't we calling it rather--effortless style?     Of course, if we wanted to assume the effortless style, we'd probably stock up on basics and then carry one reach item--something that is unusual, perhaps; or possibly, something that's expensive.  Your first photo has a woman lounging with a Louis Vuitton portfolio, the second has a girl in a bright pink dress, etc.  Things would have to be immaculately fitted by tailor for those of us who aren't 5'10 and mostly leg.  And we'd all rush to the local dermatologist, hair dresser, and Sephora to look like we'd done nothing to ourselves at all.  And then I think we'd all look about as close to effortless as money could buy.  After that, it'd all be up to the viewer of our photographs.

text:Fashion Resolutions and Goals: 2021 Edition	labels:This is a fun one: I'm planning on doing a wardrobe overhaul!   The main reason for doing this is that over the last few years I have gone down a couple of sizes (and went down another over the last few months) from improving my fitness level and now most of my wardrobe doesn't fit anymore. I literally need new clothing ASAP for the new year.  The other reason is that I want to start dressing better/more stylish and have more fun with my clothes. My style for too long has been 'what is the easiest to put together' which has ended up being a basic top with pants, no accessories and all neutral colours. Covid made me realise how boring my style when I returned to work/normal social life and realised that I was basically wearing nearly the same thing I wore while in lockdown. No wonder I was bored when I got dressed in the morning, I was dressing the same for everything just switching out denim pants for black dress pants if it was a work day. So I want to make a really fun, outgoing and exciting wardrobe.  My other resolution is I want to start sewing my own clothes. I have completed my first knitted garments this year after years of knitting and the difference between what I can make and what I can buy is enormous. I really want to see what I can do with sewing and what difference it can make to my wardrobe.
text:Congrats! And sorting on making your own clothes is an amazing goal! I didn‚Äôt state it but I do have a soft goal of sewing a few pieces for myself this next year.

I took off some time between Christmas and the new year with a big goal of sewing myself a pair of Carolyn pajamas (by Closet Core patterns) in a gorgeous fabric I bought this summer.

A pair of flips to get to the mailbox, a pair of warm boots for fall/winter excursions, and you're probably set.  I also think we'll see a resurgence of "athleisure" stuff, yoga pants, crop tops, leggings everywhere, and hoodies. No one's dressing for a day running errands or a night out on the town anymore, it's a five minute look to get out and get back, so it'll be whatever does double duty as loungewear and outside-appropriate.

text:What did your mom teach you about fashion/style - and what did she not teach you?	labels:Mine was full of contradictions when it came to us kids‚Äô appearances. She would simultaneously punish us for not looking neat or stylish enough, while not allowing or providing the tools to do so. She also had a weird mentality that creativity in style or grooming meant that someone was attention seeking, and this was meant to be a super negative moral judgment. Dyed hair, perfume, all of that was basically considered shameful to the point of being considered a sin, despite the fact that we weren‚Äôt very religious.  Growing up I was really envious of other girls whose mothers made sure they were well groomed and dressed - while fielding comments from mine about ‚Äúwhy can‚Äôt you look put together like so-and-so‚Äù. Frankly I think part of the reason why she was like this is she didn‚Äôt know how to do any of it. Picking out clothes that looked nice, doing our hair - she was not good at any of it and took out her insecurities on us.   As an adult I feel like I‚Äôve spent the past decade or so making up for lost time. I‚Äôve spent a lot of time and money figuring out what works best for me, especially with my professional goals in mind. I fit in well to the corporate world that I work in now and I have my own more creative style when I‚Äôm not working. My goal with my own kids is to provide them with the resources to be decently well dressed and groomed, to a point where they won‚Äôt be made fun of like I was, and then let them be creative.	episode_done:True

text:How do I improve my fashion sense beyond just tshirt and jeans?	labels:I recommend first picking out what aesthetic you want to take inspiration from (or aesthetics!) and get a couple basic items in that style. Something that‚Äôs easy to wear and you can look cute in with approximately no effort. Finding cute clothes is hard and very discouraging but this way, even if you‚Äôre rushing or stressed, you can have a cute outfit that compliments your style!

text:What's your fashion tragedy?	labels:One day in high school, I decided to wear my new Forever 21 white cotton skater skirt to school with an off the shoulder top. I'm usually a hidden behind the scenes, jeans and t-shirt type of girl but I had a spontaneous surge of confidence that day and decided to wear my new outfit. I was feeling extra cute all  day til I got home from school and a relative of mine gasped and said, "YOU CAN SEE YOUR UNDERWEAR THROUGH YOUR SKIRT!"  I checked in the mirror and realized with horror that my white skirt was sheer and you can clearly see the cartoon giraffe head on my Lisa Frank underwear through my skirt. There. was. a. large. giraffe. face. on. my. butt.  It's been almost 20 years and I still think about that.  Edit‚ÄîReading through the responses, I now realize that this question was more about fashion tragedies when you ruin clothes.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 23, 2020	labels:#Shoe Advice (BS Sale)  At the moment the only shoes I have that aren't sneakers are CDB's and Cowboy boots. I've been looking into getting a pair of bluchers/derbies for the past year or so and saw Beckett Simonon is doing a 2 for $289 (which seems like a banging deal).   I'm unsure if I should pull trig on the BS sale as I don't **Need** 2 of anything **but**...  I could do 2 of the following 4...   1. **Derbies**:  I'm not a big fan of broguing (but does it make them less formal than a simply leather derby? ie. [1](https://www.beckettsimonon.com/products/kent-wingtip?variant=29612720160847)  vs [2](https://www.beckettsimonon.com/products/preston-chelsea-boots-pull-up?variant=29601437614159)) but fairly neutral beyond that. Does a split toe make them less formal? I'd be using them for a business-casual internship / as a step up from chukka boots in other fits.  1. Derbies on BS:   I like the [Dunham](https://www.beckettsimonon.com/products/dunham-derby?variant=30323710459983) over the [Sutton](https://www.beckettsimonon.com/products/sutton-derbies?variant=29519524855887), but am unsure if I should grab the [full-grain](https://www.beckettsimonon.com/products/dunham-derby?variant=30323710459983) or [pull-up leather](https://www.beckettsimonon.com/products/dunham-derby-pull-up?variant=29649679319119) (I assume full-grain since they're the same price atm?) and what color to get (like the loafers, dark brown/ "oak"?).   1. **Oxfords**: I know I'll need some oxfords once I start interviewing, (2nd year Uni) waiting until Covid is over to get a suit (most likely navy, maybe charcoal). What would be a good "starter" oxford to pair with my first suit?  1. **Loafers**: I've been *fiending* for some loafers. I'm In Texas where it's summer 9 months of the year (currently 80's in late November) so I wear shorts quite regularly. Loafers seem like a good way to spruce up a summer outfit, thoughts? I'm uncertain  as to **what type** to get. I've read these [1](https://www.dmarge.com/how-to-wear-loafers) [2](https://manofmany.com/fashion/mens-fashion-advice/how-to-wear-loafers) [3](https://www.fashionbeans.com/article/guide-to-mens-loafers/) [4](https://dukeanddexter.com/blogs/d-d-world/loafer-shoes-style-guide-for-men) [5](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/jvac2i/faq_what_are_the_different_use_cases_of_boat/) [6](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/8bhse5/your_favorite_for_loafers/) articles and I'm leaning towards Penny, not a fan of Tassle, Monkstrap or Snaffle. What color would you recommend? I'm assuming a [ darker brown](https://www.beckettsimonon.com/products/lambert-loafers?variant=30324281344079) (brown) or the "oak" in the link?     1. On BS, the [Cohen](https://www.beckettsimonon.com/products/cohen-loafers?variant=29478673350735) seem the pointiest (and thus most formal?) the [lambert](https://www.beckettsimonon.com/products/lambert-loafers?variant=30324281737295) seem nice but I can't tell if there's a formality difference between them and the [Roy](https://www.beckettsimonon.com/products/roy-loafers?variant=29519471444047) which have a smaller hole. Definietely want to err on the more casual side of loaferdom.   1. **Chelsea boots:**  I'm conflicted about Chelsea boots, as I feel my chukkas already fill a good amount of their role + I don't think they'd merge with my closet well, but they're also really clean and I like them when I see them on other people. So probably not  Chelsea boots...  Would you Get Derbies & Oxfords? Derbies and Loafers? Oxfords and Loafers? Is buying 2 shoes too much to do at once? I've been pretty good about slowly adding pieces to incorporate overtime and am slightly worried I might not end up wearing one or both (thought it's not entirely an impulsive decision, I've been looking at the first 3 for a while now). Any thoughts are appreciated, sorry for the long post  **Edit** Also have a 20% discount so could get any 1 for about $160 instead of 2 for 289 ($144 each) (20% off can't stack with the BF sale)

text:Women with ADHD & Sensory Processing Disorder: I need Clothing recs!	labels:Yesss I FEEL you. I'm ADHD-PI. I've made it a rule that if I am not 100% sure it's comfortable, or the fabric is "iffy", I won't buy it/it gets purged. I won't wear it anyway.    For me, form-fitting clothing is definitely preferred but *tight* clothing is not. Eg, compression leggings/socks (holla to that sesamoid fracture) are comforting and cozy but too-tight waistbands are not.    I try to look at it as just an easy way to save money, time, and keep clutter at bay. Don't immediately love it? Don't get it. If I'm buying something brand-new, I try to go for cotton or rayon. I can't stand polyester--not in an "ew, tacky" way, but because touching it makes my skin crawl. Unfortunately, what I've found is that the soft man-made materials do that permanent pilling thing which is an issue unto itself lol     I second Uniqlo for the great textures/durability/styles, I just wish they didn't use slave labor like many other brands do (in addition to the other costs of fast fashion). Also BP. and Halogen, but I don't have many of those pieces. On the other hand, thrift stores and even resale sites like Poshmark can just be too overwhelming unless I have a specific item in mind already.  **Edit: Leggings, I recommend Zella or Girlfriend Collective. Jeans, Old Navy/Gap. Undies: Maidenform and DKNY for bras, Tomboy are my new holy grail for undies/bralette. I am also 100% on board with joggers but I just buy random ones haha, I have a pair of no-name ones from Amazon that are super comfy and a pair from Shein that are cute, sufficiently long, and a pleasant texture (don't shame me, I already feel enough guilt for buying from them lol).    I have to wear custom orthotic inserts for an indeterminate amount of time, and I already have a hard-to-find shoe size, so finding vegan options that work has kind of been a nightmare! My Asics "running" shoes have been basically the only thing I can comfortably wear all day. Hokas were too inflexible and actually ended up causing my entire body to hurt when I tried them. I have a pair of canvas Cariuma low tops that are okay for short periods of time. I'm considering getting a pair of black velvet Birdies but I have doubts about them--mainly, will my orthotics fit and will they be durable enough for everyday wear? If anyone has any vegan shoe recommendations that are quite deep but also flexible in the soles I'm all ears!
text:not sure if you‚Äôre looking for more athletic shoes, but i love brooks for running/workout shoes (i switched from asics to brooks about 5 years ago and wear a size 10, which is semi hard to find). both of my parents wear orthotics, and they will never not wear brooks in the future lol. they also have a handy quiz on their website that gives you specific recommendations!	labels:Ooh awesome, looks like they have a lot of vegan options!

text:Favourite places to get your fall wool fix?	labels:Don‚Äôt forget to check out thrift stores. This is where I stock up on cashmere sweaters for a few dollars a piece, wool skirts, kilts, sweaters, vests, and cardigans, and amazing wool blazers and coats. I‚Äôve found mint condition mohair and camel hair 3/4 coats for as low as $10, black cashmere sweaters for $2-3 and up, and cable knit pullovers for as low as $4. It‚Äôs amazing what people get rid of, not realizing how expensive it all is new. I also loooove wool in the fall and winter, and so this has been a super affordable way to build a dream cold-weather wardrobe.   The only thing wool I buy new are socks for the most part, everything else I‚Äôve found at estate sales, garage sales, and thrift shops. When/if you go, definitely go through the boys and men‚Äôs departments, too. A bit of tailoring can make anything look custom like some of the pieces on Walker Slater maybe.

I was searching through tops the other day on some big site (maybe Nordstrom?) and there were cold shoulder tops STILL FOR SALE and my mind was blown.   Oh and I also hate the tops that are split at the back. I‚Äôm sick of seeing them everywhere. At first I thought I liked it, but it turns out I don‚Äôt! I hate any sort of cut out in anything, apparently.
text:Cold shoulder tops are flattering on women who want to make their arms appear thinner. That was the appeal. The opening shows a portion of the arm Most likely to be boney, and breaks up the visual mass.  Women who have larger upper arms they want to disguise are also likely older or overweight.  Overweight women are also likely to be less affluent on average.  This is why there‚Äôs so much negativity towards cold shoulder tops.  Fashion is judged by the bodies that wear it.   That said, I never liked them either.	labels:I have broad shoulders and big upper arms. Cold shoulder tops just make me look wider with slumpier shoulders. I actually prefer shoulder pads to cold shoulders, because shoulder pads actually give me some shape and make me look powerful, whereas cold shoulders are just kind of a sad, droopy look on me.	episode_done:True

text:How would you describe the quality of self-knit/self-made clothes vs. store bought?	labels:I think hand knit clothes from a very experienced knitter can definitely be equal to or better than high end store bought, but usually the high end stuff in stores is hand knit anyways, so it‚Äôs really comparing oranges to oranges. A highly skilled knitter will probably be better than most midline machine made stuff, but a less experienced knitter likely won‚Äôt be.  While I know you said to discount price and time, it‚Äôs really what it comes down to. Most people don‚Äôt have the time to knit their own clothes to a quality that would beat machines unless it‚Äôs their main hobby or job, and most hobbyists won‚Äôt have the extra income to be able to afford on a small scale the kind of equipment someone doing it as a career, especially at a high end company, will be able to afford.   For a regular consumer, buying from a skilled knitter or high end company is usually very pricey, and mid or low skill knitters trying to sell their work that‚Äôs lower quality than machines is still far more expensive due to the way making things in small batches works.
text:Yup, making a lot of my clothes (sewing, I suck at knitting) works for me because I ALSO enjoy it as a hobby. There are plenty of things you can make without a lot of fancy equipment, and some you can make as a semi-beginner, that don't look 'homemade,' but only if you're willing to devote the time to doing it well. For me, that time is well-spent because I enjoy the puzzle of figuring out fitting and the meditative aspect of sewing fabric together. But if I didn't find it fun, there's no way that's what I'd choose to spend my free time on, and I couldn't afford to pay someone else a fair wage to do the same level of work for me.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:What are some habits that keep clothes/shoes new vs that habits that ruin them?	labels:First for cardigans and sweaters is I either go fully wool or fully cotton. Can‚Äôt be any sort of blend, and I avoid mohair. I have a cotton cardigan from urban outfitters that‚Äôs like 5-6 years old and looks brand new, so you don‚Äôt even need to go super pricey, just look at fabric content.  Second is I wash everything on cold, and hang dry as often as possible. Heat basically transforms fabric, so using it is unnecessary. I also find that it sets pit stains instead of removes them.  Shoes I have no idea. I walk a lot and constantly wear out shoes. I find leather with a sewn in sole lasts a lot longer, but flats and heels never last that long. I‚Äôve also had luck with shoes that have wooden soles which I‚Äôve added a sole with traction to.  For bags, I‚Äôve always heard it‚Äôs bad luck to keep them on the ground, but that‚Äôs more superstition than keeping it nice lol.

text:The finances of curating a high-end wardrobe through luxury resale: how much do you spend on clothing taking into account resale revenue?	labels:Going through a place like TRR to resell a luxury item will likely yield a smaller return than expected. From what I call tell their commission rate is 30-50% and unless the garment is in near pristine condition after a few years it will likely retain less of the value than anticipated. Maybe TRR would try selling it for $300 then, but you would probably net half. Most items I see going for a premium are either very desirable brands or items that are virtually unworn.   Beyond all of that it‚Äôs difficult to predict where things would end up in a few years - what‚Äôs a desirable brand on the resale market now may not be in 3-5 years. Some designers will lose value more quickly.   It‚Äôs just really not a strategy I would account for when planning a clothing budget in the long run. You can readjust as you go based on money than comes in from returning items to the resale market - but I would fully expect that in all cases you will likely loose over half the original purchase price (especially if you are not selling it directly to another consumer).
text:The only way to make it work is to sell items directly, preferably ones you‚Äôve bought at bargain basement prices. eBay, Grailed, Vestiaire etc will absolutely destroy your margin with their cut. This means building an Instagram following, finding your way into niche communities, and spending hours photographing, pricing, and listing items. If having thirsty dudes slide into your DMs is worth an extra $100 to you, it can go a long way towards making you profitable.   Even then, if you‚Äôre not buying things with an eye towards flipping, it‚Äôs going to be slow and potentially not worth the time investment. I‚Äôm a big Rick collector, and what I buy for myself has little overlap with what has significant resale value. I make most of my extra money on arbitrage between markets and reselling unisex pieces to the significantly larger male audience. If I wanted to make a significant dent in my clothing budget with resale, it‚Äôd turn into a 15-20hr/wk endeavour. Spending that same effort on my actual job would generate a much larger return, and compound over time to bootü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è	labels:The point about ROI on time spent doing this vs working is well made. I have a hunch that I would enjoy the process, but if not, it is certainly not worth it.	episode_done:True

But here are my doubts: my favorite pair of jeans is almost the same color as the jacket: would it be ok to wear them together?Also, how do you find the white collar? Isn't it a bit too big/white/noticeable?  About the Berk Jacket (the black one): it's cool, but it gives a more elegant look to a jacket that should basically be casual. Does this make sense?Also, would you wear it with blue jeans?  And at last, there's the Scarab Cord (the green one). I find it really cool. Same doubts here for the white collar, though...why don't they do it like dark green?Also, would you wear this color with dark blue?  Anyway guys I'll be happy to hear your opinions.  Thanks!
text:I own one, i'm not sure if its rockridge, but it looks close enough. I personally wouldn't wear jeans the same color.  The white color isn't as bright or noticeable in person. I feel the all black one is more versatile, I feel you could rock black jeans with it and it would still look good too.  Berk > scarab > rockridge in my opinion.

text:How much was your most expensive fashion item and when or how often do you wear it?	labels:My most expensive items have all been high quality copies of items I have in low quality but wore out the wazoo.  For example, I knew I was ready to invest in some high end Chelsea boots when I found myself going through a cheap pair every year. Or to invest in a nice leather-looking jacket when I found myself grabbing mine 70% of the time I went out.  The expensive items were hard to wear at first, maybe on date nights or to a nicer event, but as I got more used to wearing them I wore them more often. I think it took me a hot year before I wore my Red Wings more than like once a month.   My recommendation is keep the items in your comfort zone (so no wild dresses or Colors at first) and to force yourself to wear it at a regular interval. These days, just wearing nice jeans while I go shopping seems to be my ‚Äúdate night‚Äù when I dress up!
text:That‚Äôs a really good idea, buying cheap versions and seeing what you rewear. Can‚Äôt believe I haven‚Äôt thought of that.   The thing that I want to spend money on is leather lined shoes, especially chukka boots. But I also teach elementary school. All day, they step on my feet and it destroys my shoes. So I don‚Äôt want to spend more than $100 if 7 year olds are just gonna wreck them.	labels:If it doesn't bother you, I've personally found that buying used saves a ton of money. I regularly find $200+ leather boots on eBay for a fraction of the cost, often in barely worn or even fully new condition! Of course, some people think their trashed boots are still worth hundreds, but they're crazy and you have to just ignore them and look for the people who are interested in actually selling. I've also found that it's got to be eBay, can't be Poshmark or anything because they're way more expensive. I have a pair of Wolverine 1000 Mile boots ($300) that I got on eBay for $60 shipped, in great condition but already broken in and so comfortable the first time I put my foot in it. I've also found $400 Frye boots for $60, $200 Chelsea boots for $35, some even with the sole stickers still on, brand new!  Often used shoes have small blemishes or clear wear, but as soon as they're cleaned up and conditioned they look fantastic, and frankly, I'm just going to trash them as soon as I start wearing them so it doesn't really matter to me. I'd rather have the quality and durability.	episode_done:True

text:Guys who lost a lot of weight, how did you change your style?	labels:First off congrats on not moping around and leveraging 2020 in a positive way.  Your style will keep evolving but a few suggestions from having made this journey.  1.  Get your workwear wired.  Not sure of your dress code but if you are biz cas go basic bastard and pick up some cheap j crew type of stuff.  Not to much but enjoy some 484s, you've earned it.  This will tide you over professionally.   2.  Start exploring. The best way to do this is look a lot of places for inspo but keep your lens wide.  It's a wide world out there.  3.  Start picking up a few pieces here or there.  Vintage and thrifting are your friends.  Try different things.  Some will stick, some won't.  But by getting it cheap you can experiment at a discount.  4.  Think about how you can accessorize and leverage what you have.  Simple things can raise your level (but don't do them all at once).  Throw on a cardi or blazer over your biz cas.  Buy a pocket square or two.  Switch the laces in your shoes.  Have fun and congrats.	episode_done:True
text:Women who have revamped your entire wardrobe ‚Äî how did that go? What is your advice for the rest of us?	labels:I am doing this now.  I have two small kids, am in the middle of weight fluctuations, and finally decided on my style and colors.    I have been reading the blog theviviennefiles.com for a couple of years.  The colors and combinations are wonderful, even if most of the wardrobes are not my style at all.  I have figured out my colors and style by looking at the combinations there, which has been soooooo helpful.    Now that I know what colors suit me best, I am being ruthless in ONLY purchasing clothing in those colors.  No matter what.  Yellow is a terrible color next to my face.  I will not buy anything with yellow undertones to wear on my top half at all, and I try to avoid it for pants too.  Highly saturated jewel tones are beautiful, and also too much for my coloring.  I need more pastel or muted colors to look my best.  I am a mid 30s mom of two young kids.  The only things I am willing to dry clean are suits for work.  Everything else had better be machine washable because I don't go to dry cleaners that often!  I'm losing weight and plan to go down another size (at least), so I'm not buying anything full price.  Luckily there are good sales right now and I can wait until the next round of sales at my favorite stores.    I'm not messing around with statement pieces or trends.  I have too much on my plate to care right now.  I'm buying black, grey, and navy pants and tops and adding in some lighter blues and greys for variation in my tops at work.  I can get fancy with work clothes when my kids are older.  I'm also not messing around with fancy at home.  I have some stretchy, durable yoga pant type bottoms and a stack of solid color tshirts.  I LOVE the supima cotton tshirts from Lands End so I'm buying those on  sale and using that to experiment with which colors suit me best.  Even if the colors aren't quite right for me, the tshirt is amazingly comfortable and durable and it's likely to get ruined by baby mess anyways.    I do plan to expand into a more versatile wardrobe once my kids are older and society opens back up again.  These two sets of clothes have been my pandemic revamps, so I'm sticking with this for the time being.	episode_done:True

But don‚Äôt splurge on a crap ton of clothes that are super fancy, uncomfortable or for going out. Don‚Äôt do that!  But do get: more sweaters if you need (cold house?) comfy/fancy lounge clothes, or even a nice top that speaks to you (if you have an online work meeting).   And do get something that truly fits YOU and your style. Like who cares about flare jeans? Will you wear jeans in the house?   Another factor is weight. Have you gained during pandemic? So will you get your moneys worth by buying fun clothes that won‚Äôt fit you after?  It sounds like maybe you‚Äôre in some type of slump. Every other day I get dressed up in something fun or experimental, just to keep that creative abs pampering side of me. But it‚Äôs just for me abs my mental health.
text:Yeah I‚Äôm not planning to splurge on a ton of trendy clothes, was just thinking about maybe adding a couple new updates to my wardrobe. I don‚Äôt go out much, just occasionally go outside, run errands, etc.   Actually not into flare jeans. I like straight leg jeans, which have a looser fit than skinny jeans, but aren‚Äôt that loose. I have one pair sort of like that; most of the leg is slim straight w/ a slightly looser fit, and then at the bottom gets narrower by the leg opening.   Not in a slump. Just that majority of the time nowadays I wear sweatpants or leggings w/ a basic top such as a t shirt or pullover since that‚Äôs what I reach for in the morning before I have to log into my work computer. I‚Äôm never on camera for work, not even during Skype meetings. So yeah, not thinking to buy a ton of clothes, maybe just a few things.	labels:I did the same thing. It‚Äôs not bad to see a trend and connect with it.   For me, I‚Äôve really loved rust abs caramel since it goes with my skin tone. When pink/blush was in it was terrible, as that makes me look naked (for skin tone reference).   I‚Äôd say for the sake of mental health, what‚Äôs a tiny splurge? What‚Äôs a tiny purchase that makes you feel good?  You sound level headed!	episode_done:True

I got my leather jacket back out this week because it's decidedly autumnal here now. I'm not at home all the time, and even  if I was, I'm sick of earthy/neutral loungewear/athleisure in general. I appreciate lots of people like it but I don't want dozens of collections of drab pink and beige pjs strutting down every runway and I have little interest in linen or billowy stuff right now so IDK, I like garish colours and bad bitch stuff.

text:Ellen McArthur Circular Economy Report: by 2029 Resale is expected to be bigger than Fast Fashion	labels:Excited about this!  Rent the Runway (clothing rentals) just partnered with ThredUp (thrifting site) to get rid of their old inventory.   RtR has a discount shop for the clothes they don't rent out anymore but it seems like they had even more inventory lying around and they handed it over to ThredUp to sell even steeper.  Add to that the great stuff happening on Postmark, Depop, Etsy, and TheRealReal, and it's awesome to be a thrifter right now. I'm glad its all expanding.  I've been doing slow fashion for a few years and a lot of my closet is now second hand which makes me happy. Idk what the trigger was for other people but when I found out that fashion is one of the biggest polluting industries in the world, it changed my whole perspective.   Also gladd that FFA is getting more behind thrifting and second hand. Yall are the best <3	episode_done:True
text:What are your thoughts on outfit repeating multiple days in a row?	labels:Yes.  While school is in session, I love to pick an outfit that makes me feel more like my best self and wear it every day for the school week!

text:Style rut: Pinterest vs reality	labels:I too am going through a similar struggle (but without the dick friend).  I (as I'm sure with countless others) have tons of clothes in the closet I don't wear. I always resort to the  comfiest outfit acceptable to society.     I want to change my image but don't want to sacrifice comfort.   I realized that confines is the ultimate reason. Aside from just legit basic comfort, much of this uncomfort comes from my fluctuating (usually just increasing) weight.   I don't want to buy more clothes that sit unused in my closet.  So I took advantage of all the online sales and focused on updated versions of outfits I already love (e.g. black beater tank top, replaced with a nice thicker strapped tank top, loose fitting and a cute little pocket, as well as updated colours for baggy sweaters, similar to ones I already have).  I made sure to be honest with myself "will you wear this??"    Also, don't do a complete 180 style wise, I would suggest starting off with basic updates and work your way to a more different look (like eating habits; its very hard to stick to a plan if its dramatically different from your comfort zone).    Also something I want to do (but haven't yet) is make different outfits, and take pix them and keep them in a folder on your phone.  I'm hoping seeing the outfit will make me want to wear it more.   Sorry that this was just me talking about myself, but I just meant it as sharing what I found worked/didn't

text:Do you have any pieces that "should not" work with your body that just seems to work?	labels:I find most rules are trash, and ascribe to shaming women for having different features. If you have broad shoulders, a padded blazer with sharp lines can be such an aesthetic.   I find if you don't believe in fashion rules, there's always a version of something that will work for you.
text:I don't find that at all. I watched a video where 4 women with different body shapes all tried styles that weren't supposed to be flattering. At the end of the video, the opinions hadn't changed.  I do see how that can be limiting & believe that people should wear whatever they want regardless though.	labels:I mean, a video intended to prove a point is going to select examples that support their argument, no?	episode_done:True
text:Brands that are actually great that you discovered on Instagram?	labels:Pact is great for cotton basics, all of their clothes are so soft, thick, well made, and durable. Some items are crazy flattering on me and then other stuff I‚Äôve had to return because they just missed the mark. They have good customer service and do free returns.
text:I want to like Pact but they seem very inconsistent. I've seen so many reviews from brand newbies and regulars talking about inconsistent product quality. My Green Closet featured one of their shirts in a video and it just looked [terrible](https://imgur.com/a/hleSO7H). Wish the brand paid more mind to quality consistency, though I'm sure that'd bump up the prices a lot.	labels:Agreed.

Yeah buddy, it‚Äòs simple geometry, look at the extreme angle of my size 6 foot with my heels raised four inches above the floor, and then look at yours with your size 13 feet.

text:What are your go-to, everyday shoes?	labels:Doc Marten boots. You'll get compliments from gen-x'ers because they used to be cool in the 90's, and you'll get compliments from millennials and Gen Z'ers because they're cool again. They're kinda like the band The Pixies. If you know, you know. They're also terribly comfortable and waterproof.  You'll buy 'em and wear them for years.   People will talk about how they're different now and not as good as before but even this new version are still high quality to me. I wear [this pair](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pinterest.com%2Fpin%2F654570127070834072%2F&psig=AOvVaw2G4DCAafxUzdLn3d3X6JTS&ust=1609867019606000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAIQjRxqFwoTCJi9z5Dkgu4CFQAAAAAdAAAAABAM) with everything.
text:I nabbed a pair of 8053s off Poshmark a couple years ago and fell in love. They're the dreamiest shoes I've ever worn: solid, androgynous, comfortable, weatherproof, good for dressing up or down, wearing with or without socks, in the summer and the winter, after five-hour walks in the city. Soles thick enough to leave me plenty to work with even after I scrape the hell out of the heels. I'm a terrible shoe owner, but my Docs have been unerringly kind to me. Tough to find women's shoes with a similar mix of comfort + versatility + understated style + availability at relatively affordable prices secondhand.	labels:I was with you until the without socks part - no matter how much I love a pair of boots, there is no way those babies are coming near my feet without a pair of socks between us	episode_done:True

text:i haven't but i mean what is even the point of doing it onsite at that pt? if you hand a pair of shoes to someone and they hand you some cash there's no verification or authentication there. i don't think grailed can authenticate something like that understandably but you're best off asking in the grailed subreddit	labels:Yeah I understand that grailed probably cant authenticate the purchase. I'm happy to just deliver the item and receive cash, but I'm not sure if Grailed would be happy with that since they don't receive any commission for listing my item, plus there won't be any feedback on the transaction.

text:That necklace is so pretty!  I shop a lot at H&M, so next time I'm there I'll make sure to stop and actually pay attention to the jewelry section. I love how rings look when I see other women wearing them, so definitely want to try some.	labels:I recommend using something like etsy for jewellery!

text:How many handbags do you have and which one is your most used?	labels:I live in Europe and do office work. On regular basis I use only one bag, and nothing from my "collection" is luxury. 1. bobobark, use it basically every day when I need to carry a laptop (i.e., every working day) 2. silver leather small flat purse - use when I go out and have no pockets 3. casual backpack for when on travel 4. beach bag for seaside 5. bronze leather clutch for fancy occasions
text:What do you think of the bobobark? I ended up selling mine so I‚Äôm curious what someone else thinks of it.	labels:Oh, it's perfect for me. I use only backpack option, and that was exactly what i was looking for. It's backpack, it fits laptop, it matches my style, it is more feminine that 99% of laptop backpacks over there and it doesn't look huge on me (I'm 161, so most of laptop bags look half my size). Quality is also nice (at least so far).  And what didn't you like in it?	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone take their ‚Äúpower color‚Äù really seriously?

A featured/central color doesn‚Äôt always have to mean monochrome; even just having the dashes of pink in everything makes putting outfits together easier.  Whoops published too early, but re: ‚Äúis dressing like this annoying?‚Äù  I am lucky in that I am a stand up comic so I can wear pretty much whatever to work and don‚Äôt have to adhere to a dress code, but I truly honestly could not give less of a fuck if people are annoyed by my pink, or by my clothes in general. If it annoys YOU to narrow your closet down to just one color, then don‚Äôt do it! But don‚Äôt dress to appease other people - it‚Äôs your life and your body and you should decorate it however makes you happiest. Wearing all pink makes me feel like Elle Woods winning the trial at the end of Legally Blonde. If wearing all neon orange makes you feel like a bad bitch, go to town you fabulous lil traffic cone. Wear all blue and serve some Veruca Salt realness, IDGAF. Or wear every color of the rainbow at once! Just invest in things that make you happy.

text:I need help with getting rid of clothes	labels:Hi! As a stylist I get this question ALOT. For starters don't get rid of too much before buying replacements. What ends up happening is we get rid of everything without establishing what pieces we actually need.   Start with establishing your personal style. What do your want your closet/style to be? What do you want to look like on the day to day?   Next, set aside pieces that don't fit you well. If there is potential to have the piece tailored then get that done. Key here is to just set these pieces aside but dont get rid of them yet until you find a replacement just in case you HAVE to wear it again.   Lastly is shopping! Now that you have a moodboard and list of things you need you can shop to fin in the gaps and more importantly you can shop with intention!   &#x200B;  I hope that wasn't too much and was helpful haha. I'm always happy to help.
text:That's actually really helpful! How do you suggest finding my style? I feel like I have such a wide style that I wear (minimal, to punk, to cutesy, etc). I feel like I love all of my clothes but some go months without being worn.	labels:A more direct answer to your question, and something that may help you cull your closet, is through a lot of self reflection and analysis.   Personal style exists at the intersection of life function and self expression. Clothing is the way you define yourself to the world, but is also integral in how well you function in that world. What purposes do you need your clothing to fulfill‚Äî do you need to have good pockets? Easy movement? Hypoallergenic fabrics? Do you have a work uniform? What do you want your clothing to say about yourself to others?   Of the things in your closet right now, what do you love? Why do you love it? Is it the texture of the fabric? The construction? Certain stylistic elements? The way it fits you? Get really specific, put it on and think about the fact that you‚Äôre wearing it as you‚Äôre going about your day and how you feel in it and why.    Keep going: What do you wear all the time? Why do you wear it all the time over other things? What do you hate? Why do you hate it? What do you never wear? Why not? What clothing do you hate but wear all the time or love but never wear and why? Spend a lot of time on these questions because they‚Äôll help you put the language to your needs and wants. When you have some answers, then you can start searching for trends amongst the things you love and the things you hate, and learning the details of clothing and construction that will best help you hone in on what you like. Review fabric composition; find your color trends; learn the names of structural elements that you see in several garments you love or hate; this will all help you seek out or avoid those better in the future.   Once you have some of those answers you can pointedly look for pieces to replace those that you hate but wear all the time with ones you love that align better with your needs or preferences, and you can cull accordingly.

text:Do you feel constrained fashion-wise by not wanting to (or being able to) wear heels?	labels:I wear heels every day because I love them, BUT I think outfits that are tailored nicely (I.e pants that don‚Äôt drag if you aren‚Äôt in heels, skirts hitting mid calf or ankle not in between) look great with flats!  I broke my toe a while ago and had to wear flats for a few weeks and although it felt unusual and made me feel short for the first few days, I think my outfits ended up still looking nice! It just depending on what I wore.  I went with a lot of knee length skirts with tights, tighter pants that came to my ankle and knee length sheath dresses.   A pointed toe flat also has the same sort of look as a lot of heels, and a round toe quilted flat can look super nice as well!	episode_done:True

text:Has anyone else ever tried on a designer item just to see what the hype is about?	labels:I remember once passing by the designer section at Winners (Canada‚Äôs TJ Max) and the silk sleeve of a Celine dress fluttered over my hand and seemed to wrap around. I had to stop. It felt otherworldly and magic- the fabric, the drape. Extraordinary! Probably another week and it would be tattered and dusty from falling on the floor and snagging on hangers üò±  I bet designer stuff in the middle range, like 500-800$, would just feel like normal clothes though.  I have a silk velvet robe from the 1930s that has that magical feel. It‚Äôs so strangely light and luxurious. Maybe I should pull it out for the next Zoom meeting...
text:I walked into a Betsey Johnson store in NYC with my friend once. Her clothes always look great, but I had no idea how well made they are. The second I touched on dress the quality of the fabric took my breath away.   Since I was with a friend I was brave enough to pull the dress out. We stood there examining every seam. There's a lot to examine on a Betsey Johnson piece. You don't see stitches on the back of a button, there was another smaller button, or a colorful little patch covering the stitches. Everywhere you looked she added something. I forgot to look at the price, but it was worth whatever she was charging.  I've seen a lot of expensive things that didn't seem worth the price, but I'll never forget that dress.	labels:Betsy Johnson really is great. Such an awesome example of how quality doesn't mean fashion has to be understated. I have a pair of sunglasses that are leopard print cat-eyes with rhinestone corners. But it's not really rhinestones, it's mirrored divots in the frame, so they can't fall off like rhinestones do over time.	episode_done:True

text:Decolonize Sustainable and Ethical Fashion	labels:The concept of decolonization is misapplied in this case. Exploitation of any worker, anywhere, is unjust regardless of the colour of their skin. This has less to do with colonial structures, and more to do with hierarchical structures created when companies push the bottom line which permeate race and gender.   That being said, the pressure should not fall on the consumer to pay exponentially more if a product is produced in a sustainable way. Companies nowadays use 'sustainable' and 'ethical' to overcharge for products.   To my point, the concept of people exploiting people is not new. Exploitation of the consumer is also just as prevalent.   The best way to change is to push for regulatory processes which ensure a stable, healthy supply chain.
text:I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs misapplied. The article talks about how most major retailers involved in ‚Äúgreenwashing‚Äù produce their clothes in the Global South, relying on colonial structures that extract resources (in this case, labor), cripple the local economy, and enrich foreign (usually Western) companies. They also mention labor in the US, but even then, a large chunk of our exploited labor base is composed of immigrants--who often come to the US to escape the conditions that exist in their home countries precisely because of colonialism.   Does that apply to all greenwashing? No. But with regards to the industry as a whole I think "decolonization" is a fair goal and not necessarily misapplied.	labels:How is it that "typically western" countries are to blame for practices which existed since the dawn of society?  I mean, external companies aside, the internal procedures, laws, regulations of a country must be extremely flawed if it cant protect against exploitation of its own citizens. To blame practices steps removed from western civilization is misguided and shows that you dont understand how "western" - or, honestly any corporation in general - forms contracts with countries that provide the factories and labor to produce their products.  What do I mean when I say that? Any companies task is to seek out competitive pricing with its manufacturers. Factory owners - aka business owners operating within *that* country - proceed to seek out clients while in competition with other firms. This process would exist *regardless* of whether western clients/firms existed or not.  Take China for example. With a population of 1.398 billion, the country can sustain exploitative practices regardless of whether "western" countries choose to seek out Chinese manufacturers. China & India are great examples of countries that have sustained immense growth in their middle class over the past few decades - enough middle class to sustain the rampant consumerism western countries achieved earlier.  So no, I don't think the burden falls on the western client as much as it falls on the actual manufacturer - the managers that operate within a domain which drives them to exploit their own. That's where your western argument becomes problematic. Because it fails to acknowledge the greater problem - which is the exploitation and price minimization each firm will seek to take regardless of where it is or who it's exploiting. Your entire post sidesteps the fact that these countries do not have & do not seek to enforce the rules western countries have enforced for decades.  Furthermore the entire post glosses over the inner workings of the supply chain, thereby unjustifiably placing the burden of direct management (aka. day-to-day working conditions of factory workers) on the client - the management & design groups like Fashion Nova who do not have the authority (nor is it their job in the first place) to micromanage to the level you suggest they should - aka. make regular day to day inspections of working conditions which are initially deemed to be satisfactory. Working conditions which are *sold* to them by the owners of those factories. Along with inspection reports, management reports, and the standard (western) procedures in place to ensure they're doing their due diligence in selecting a competitive manufacturer.  And then, to go on and place focus on women and children of color implies that no one else can be, or is, exploited - and that this problem somehow has something to do with race, or with "westerners" choosing to exploit and harass people of non western origin.  This post comes across as a whole lot of finger pointing along with making the claim that "western" firms are the big bad guys, making out firms and competitors in other countries essentially the "victim" of colonization & therefore racist segregation & racial dominance, and and turning a blind eye to ongoing practice of rampant consumerism in the rest of the world.  Wanna get down to the solution? Let's increase minimum wage so that the people working in Starbucks & McDonalds can afford to pay $30, $50, $100 for a top. Let's increase funding to tech firms which disrupt the supply chain by replacing worker with machine in domestic manufacturing processes. It's possible, but it means that you'll have to pay more in tax & acknowledge the fact that not everyone in the western world can afford to consistently buy from Sezane.	episode_done:True

I've always been into minimalism black/grey/navy/white, but lately I've been embracing my Hudson Valley roots, specifically the upper appalachian/lower catskill area. It's got a lot of folk tradition, personality, and hippies.

text:How Carhartt A Billion-Dollar Brand	labels:I'm born and raised in Michigan, I love that it's a Detroit brand. I think it wraps up everything about the city in their clothes.  Their stuff LASTS too. If you get one of their jackets, you'll only ever need to own one (unless you get really fat and it doesn't fit any more or something) because of how durable they are. Even when they get beat up a little they look great.
text:I love their stuff, but it‚Äôs a shame that their prices have not reflected the fact that nearly everything is imported now. For example, if you look at the Fall Essentials on their webpage right now, there are 57 items. Only 2 are made in the US - a beanie, and a pair of socks.	labels:...their prices reflect that they've bought out all the local brand jackets that I have that are reaching their end of life after 10 years	episode_done:True
text:I need help with getting rid of clothes	labels:If you have the space, start by taking out from your closet anything you‚Äôre considering getting rid of. Put them somewhere else (in a tote/box, or a different room, some kind of storage area). Wait for a while to actually get rid of them, a few weeks, a few months, up to you. If you don‚Äôt go searching for them in that time, you‚Äôre probably ready to get rid of them, so without opening the box, just get rid of them/donate them. If you went searching for something in that time, put it back in your closet.	episode_done:True
text:Brands that are actually great that you discovered on Instagram?	labels:Pact is great for cotton basics, all of their clothes are so soft, thick, well made, and durable. Some items are crazy flattering on me and then other stuff I‚Äôve had to return because they just missed the mark. They have good customer service and do free returns.
text:Agreed. I did a great t-shirt search in the spring including Pact, Kotn (the WORST), Eddie Bauer, Everlane, lululemon (the love t - my favorite but also priciest of the bunch), and Madewell. I was looking for tees that were a slightly longer length, v-neck, well fitted, but still loose and comfy, and 100% cotton. Also not pocket because it‚Äôs not my thing which essentially nixed Madewell.  Other than LuLu which was definitely in a different category, Pact had my favorite v-neck t that met all of those requirements. I especially loved the longer length and it actually came in color (and ones that I liked) and not just white, black, gray, and navy. However, there were some interesting consistency issues which seemed related to color and/or material. Certain colors were a longer length than the others by a little and were not prone to shrinking even through multiple washes. Other colors/heathered material were just a smidge shorter and shrunk a tiny bit. Definitely not to the point where I didn‚Äôt like them, but it was an obvious difference.   They seem to be expanding their range and not restocking as many old styles. Hard to say whether that‚Äôs a food or bad thing.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What Do You Wear With Strong Sentimental Value?	labels:Pop's Ring  My wedding ring was my Grandad's wedding ring. I lost mine and after he passed I decided I would wear his in place of mine.   3 diamond setting is a bit flashy for standard mens wedding ring, I imagine it had to be super flashy back in his day (born in 1916). He was always a great dresser and a great man. We were very close, he's been gone 9 years now, I still think of him daily.

text:Best and Worst Purchase of 2020	labels:Best thing I bought this year was a seafoam cardigan from Cotton On. I've never dared to wear such a colour before because my wardrobe is, frankly, very lacking in softer, pastel shades, but I was surprised by its versatility! Definitely expanded my outfit choices a bit (plus it's soft and comfortable lol).   Worst might be a pair of khaki corduroy jeans I bought on asos? I've always had my eye on this pair of jeans and had the opportunity to buy it on black friday, but damn, have I ever regretted a purchase. I bought a length that was far too long for me (which I admittedly should've considered more before purchasing) and, although the waist *fits* fine, there is so much excess fabric that is makes my ass look HUGE (and this is after it's been rolled up thrice!). Considering tailoring but not sure if the extra hassle is worth it.   An item I'm still unsure about is a pair of chonky white shoes I bought at UGGS for my birthday. Seemed like a good idea, but I'm really not used to wearing such large shoes so I've gotten really insecure whenever I have worn them aha. Flare jeans are really good at hiding them, but besides that I'm not sure if they were worth the $100.   Welp, those were my top best/worst/unsure purchases of 2020. My wardrobe has gone a dramatic change though, so that's that!	episode_done:True

text:I‚Äôm the same way, weirdly, thought there‚Äôs a few of them in this album that toe the line into looking good in my opinion.   I quite like a nice parka, but the light down jackets just look odd to me. Part of it is the shine which I think looks awful, another is the prominenty puffy horizontal lines just look ugly to me.

text:Brands that no longer live up to their name or quality	labels:I've been really disappointed with all the Doc Martens products I've bought in the last decade or so. Prior to that, all the Docs I bought were decently high quality, and I still have them. But my more recent purchases have been much lower quality.  Most egregious to me were the [rainbow glitter Docs](https://www.drmartens.com/us/en/p/womens-boots-glitter-pu-pascal-gltr) I bought, which have NO SEALANT WHATSOEVER on top of the glitter, so it flakes off every time I touch it. Like, what??
text:Oof, I've been hearing that everywhere. I've been dreaming of being able to afford a pair of Docs since I was 15, and now that I finally can, I basically changed my mind last minute bc of the bad feedback and ordered a New Rock pair instead. I'm still breaking them in and hoping it'll be worth it üòÄ	labels:I got a pair of docs (the Rometty) this fall and I love them!

text:I dont really get it either I went in one time and in store they only have a really tiny section of menswear. I wanted to try out their pants but they have a weird size thing that all the pants are 32L.	labels:They will hem them for you for free.	episode_done:True

text:DAE feel a disconnect between fashion you see in movies or TV and fashion you see in real life?	labels:I've been bingeing Star Trek. Give me a jumpsuit worthy of space travel. Barring that, I'll continue wearing a boatneck 3/4 sleeve top with dark wash jeans. My hair will be in a ponytail or French twist a la Seven of Nine because hair is annoying.   I used to try to be fashionable. It hurt my wallet and my ego as I tried keeping up. So many trends just don't work on me. I found a uniform that looks put together for my needs and requires little thought.
text:I had a Trek inspired 60s retro futurist obsession once. It's actually pretty easy to do. Long sleeve skater dress, best with mock neck, black tights, plain black boots, with some random abstract minimalist metal brooch on the chest. Suddenly you're a retro Starfleet cadet. Except then I realized I hate tight fitted dresses and never wear tights. So there goes that costume fantasy.	labels:I love this idea! I just looked it up and daaaaang were their skirts short though.

I remember in one episode a senior partner commented on her attire and said the way she dresses doesn‚Äôt say senior partner material, it says Vogue. And Joan did dress nice. Had a birkin bag and wore Louboutins, very cute blouses with skirts and ice dresses  Fran Fine from The Nanny  I think Hilary and Whitley are style goals for work attire but I love Ashley‚Äôs style  And yes I know these are characters from older shows, but I feel like their styles can be modernized

text:Does AGE really effect your choice of Fashion - Clothing Trends (Discussion)	labels:I'm from Japan and a male in those age categories, would likely dress quite differently.  Japan is a land of 'Uniforms'. many spend much of their grade school to high school in a uniform.  when they go out and get a job.. they gotta wear a 'uniform'.. either a suit and tie, or some company uniform.  College is usually the time for experimentation, but because people have such a strong hard-on for fads and trends, they end up being in a uniform again.  maybe in 2017-18 ish. the trend for college age men was a wool chester coat and a hoodie underneath (a mix of very casual and slightly formal).  fast forward 2-3 years later, it nearly completely fell out in favor of oversized fleece jackets, or North Face Nuptse and other similar puffers.. usually in black and yellow.  guys 30s to 40s stop dressing like that  guys 40s and up tend to focus more on brands to flex their income and status, but often wear ill fitting stuff.. as well as strange color stuff (likely went to a Ralph Lauren outlet and could only afford that bright yellow shirt that was on sale because no one would buy it)  People often judge you by what you wear as they think it reflects your occupation or status. For example some one wearing shiny black with a lot of accessories is perceived to be involved in the night industries and probably of lower education or culture.
text:What is the perception of somebody wearing full Yohji or Julius?	labels:they are not brands on the radar of most Japanese.       There's no identifiable logo on there, so most people wouldn't know what they are   as for the styling they are associated with, if a person here saw that, they probably think.. oh that's some person that's into some unique sub-culture. not mainstream  What non-Japanese  like about Japanese fashion tends to be very different than what local Japanese like. (i.e. this sub raves about all these expensive Japanese denim brands, but no one in Japan really wears fancy denim jeans these days, let alone know of some of the brands being brought up here).	episode_done:True
text:What niche do you feel is missing from the fashion blogging/YouTube world?	labels:Vibrant eclectic!

I need to bring my Pinterest to life!	episode_done:True
text:Fast Fashion: What are your wardrobe all-stars?	labels:Target puts out basic crew and v-neck sweaters every year.  They're some awful synthetic blend but darn it if they aren't perfect for pairing with patterned skirts.  I've been wearing them in some form for almost 15 years--and since they're inexpensive, it doesn't bother me too much when they wear out.	episode_done:True
text:How many pairs of jeans and pairs of shoes should you own?	labels:I probably have about 6 or 7 pairs of jeans with different colors and different fits.  I usually wear the same 2 or 3 pairs though.    I have more than 30 pairs of shoes . I'm not a fashionista but they do accumulate over time. It's nice to have a few options to choose from. And they can really help to change the tone of an outfit.
text:At last someone with more shoes than I have!  I did a count in response to another post and know the answer is 21.  But mine are just worn in rotation in their set, I don't do outfits, any tee/shirt goes with any jean/trouser with any shoe/boot/sandal, rotations within the set for the season.  Anything I own, with only a couple of exceptions, gets worn in rotation with the others in the set.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Help needed for buying jeans online! All advice is welcome!	labels:Read the reviews, but sort by new. If the newest reviews are good, you‚Äôre probably good. You can also sort reviews by height and weight on most sites, which makes it easier to tell if a pair of jeans will fit your body type. Size charts are also a miracle, just remember the waist measurement has to be pretty close to your waist size for them to fit without a belt. Hip measurements don‚Äôt matter as much unless you‚Äôre wearing low rise. MEASURE YOUR INSEAM AND CHECK TO MAKE SURE THE PANTS ARE LONG ENOUGH. Check the fabric content to see how much give they will have, more give means you can wear measurement a little bigger or smaller than your actual measurements. Always buy jeans with free returns or a return price low enough you‚Äôll be willing to return them if they don‚Äôt fit, because no matter how hard you try, there will always be a pair or two that just don‚Äôt fit right.
text:Hip measurements matter a lot for jeans... the standard difference for jean design is 10 inches between the waist and hips, so if youre outside of that difference either way you have to pay a lot of attention to the hip measurement.  The hip measurement is what ensures that the seat of the jeans fits.	labels:Yeah, I was going to say...  You can tailor down a waist, but you can't tailor out tight hips.	episode_done:True

text:Hiking and the Outdoors Inspo Album	labels:I wanted to throw something together to showcase the trend of hiking and outdoors gear in fashion. I really gravitate towards this aesthetic because of its interesting materials and neat details; think techwear but you don't dress like a nerd from Cyberpunk 2077. You can really see this trend dominating with Salomons and trail runners right now, but things like hiking boots, fleece, cargo pants, pockets (lots of them), technical fabrics, and more are here to stay.  Notable brands you may want to look at if you like this aesthetic are Salomon, The North Face, Columbia, Patagonia, Battenwear, Gramicci, Keen, Fjallraven, and Lakh Supply. Definitely not a comprehensive list, but all good options.
text:Adding Hoka One One and Merrell since they have a similar vibe to Salomon.

I try to wear the Harrington jacket at night as the temperature starts to drop, but I find that my shirt is much longer than the jacket, and it looks like a miniskirt.

Where to find single pleat, loose fit, non cropped pants?  Most places still have slim, flat front pants. I've looked at Alex Mill and COS, but all those seem to be cropped and/or not in stock. I want pants like the one Becks is wearing in these photos, [https://imgur.com/a/FJO9KrO](https://imgur.com/a/FJO9KrO) loose, slight break. I'd also want to try them on if possible as this would be a step in a new direction.   I'm located in Vancouver, Canada.

I'm not obese but have particularly large calves due to genetics, and I'm not too sure how i should be styling them. Always liked those slim fit looks but can never pull it off due to my calves. Also looking to make a suit, so need some advice on that.
text:I think a lot of OTR non-trendy brands will fit you pretty well.   I'm talking Dockers, Tasso Elba, Levis, Brooks Brothers et al.     If you pay attention to fabric (minimal synthetics), I'm sure you'll find something cut to your liking.      Of course this is the entry level suggestion, there are tons of tailoring brands, but it really depends on what you want.   Do you really want tailoring, chinos or maybe workwear?     All very subjective.     Regarding a suit, again specificity helps.   Budgets are a key constraint.      OTR with your described calves issue may not be possible, because many good brands may not accomodate your unique calves.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Balenciaga FALL/WINTER 2021 (Afterworld: The Age of Tommorow)	labels:To play the game: https://videogame.balenciaga.com/  Balenciaga statement: > The Fall 21 collection is an expression and evolution of the Summer 21 Pre-Collection (shown digitally this past October), making its first appearance off-season, in December of 2020. It is first presented on a VR runway visible only via a headset sent out to a limited number of guests.   > On December 6th, it is introduced to the public in Afterworld: The Age of Tomorrow a video game designed especially for this season. The game and the collection imagine a near future in which clothing is meant to transform over many years. Treatments tease out the aging process of materials, emphasizing the idea of wearing something for decades or repurposing it forever.   > In Afterworld each player chooses an avatar and takes it on a hero‚Äôs journey set in the year 2031. A store exit leads to busy street and further on to a dark forest in which a secret rave is going on. Beyond that is a mountain, atop which waits a surprise, once the player completes some challenges. Throughout the game, other avatars wear the Balenciaga Fall 2021 collection. Suits and coats are made to be worn anywhere. Tailored suits made in T shirt jersey are stonewashed and pre stretched to look worn and are extra comfortable. Other pre crinkled tailored suits don‚Äôt ever need an iron. Super destroyed suits show a loving amount of wear already. Performance tailoring is made from mesh lined stretch materials suitable for hiking, cycling, or anything.   > In the future, a garment that appears to serve one function may serve another, seeing as certain materials will be reinterpreted for new uses. A satin trench is not a coat but a party dress. Jeans layered over pants and sweats showing a boxer short waistband are actually each a single item. As animal fur is no longer appropriate for people to buy new, a puffer is embroidered with recycled fabric that was laser cut to mimic the movement of a fur jacket. Many products are remade to perform new functions, like a blanket that becomes a coat or a hooded cape. A transformer parka with large exterior pockets also acts as a functional duffel bag. A scooter lap apron is flipped to become a thermal wrap coat. A military coverall is re constructed to form an evening gown. A jacket in unassuming black is reversible in case of hazard, its other side made for high visibility.   > Outerwear jackets and dresses are re envisioned with an asymmetrical construction that always exposes one shoulder. The imbalanced volume and a suggestion of skin infuses tough, vintage, or sporty styles with an attitude of casual elegance.   > The Summer 21 presentation video is directed by Walter Stern and set to a new cover of Corey Hart‚Äôs ‚ÄúSunglasses at Night‚Äù by BFRND. Throughout the video, large, wraparound sunglasses are omnipresent. Their anatomical shape and light-obscuring lenses, especially at night, represent an irreplaceable element of the fashion silhouette.   > Shirts, dresses, and pants are patched onto other garments, creating the effect of an item being held up in front of the wearer in a moment of indecision. Each extra item becomes an accessory, like a printed top on the front of a T shirt, a pair of fluid dresses bonded together, and cargo shorts engineered onto the front of jeans. Speculating that fashion is a modern day ‚Äúworn to protect against the elements or judgement, Elizabethan armor made in the exact same way it was centuries ago appears in a new allegoric context, as if destined for a modern day Joan of Arc. The hinged, meticulously hammered metal suit evokes a far and unimaginable future by invoking a far and long forgotten past. Like armor on another scale, silver sequined items resemble dragon skin or a tangle of icicles, at once hard and delicate.   > NASA logos from disparate eras suggest retro astronaut wear from a time before mass space travel, repurposed into futuristic outerwear. Gaming champion uniforms feature, among other logos, that of the PlayStation 5, launched in November of 2020. A standard collegiate sweatshirt reads ‚Äú alluding to an advanced state of mind and the importance of freedom in future societies. Another T shirt asks that the wearer be taken to a Balenciaga store if lost. Other shirts offer information about circular fashion and closing the clothing waste loop. Chevalier boots, pumps, and derby shoes are made in the style of armor from four centuries ago, reimagined in a lacquered material much lighter than the traditional steel. The 3 D Pump, an innovation in durability, represents a wearable product that is full y 3 D printed. The Flip Shoe is a flat flip flop that is worn by folding one section forward and attaching it between the toes. Alien shaped anatomic sunglasses shield the face in extreme proportions while the Fluffy Cat style is covered in sustainable faux fur.

It‚Äôs been cold (with hazardous air) for a week since the sun is blocked but today the smoke cleared off and it was unexpectedly hot!  I would say my fall jacket staple is a denim jacket. In previous years, I wore more cropped styles but I picked [this](https://agolde.com/products/charli-jacket-heed) up early in the shelter in place.  I also have [this jacket](https://www.freepeople.com/shop/dolman-quilted-knit-jacket/?color=065&countryCode=US&gclid=CjwKCAjwzIH7BRAbEiwAoDxxTkmo_6D_-1SVQufIbsFYcaZIK9iWj7gYd3STLg1cikNIQYCHHVgCAhoCvB8QAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds&inventoryCountry=US&size=XL&type=REGULAR&quantity=1) in a really really light lavender, almost grey color. In the fall though, it is honestly too hot by the afternoon to keep this on.  I would say my most specifically fall jacket is this "[double cloth motorcycle jacket" from J. Crew](https://di2ponv0v5otw.cloudfront.net/posts/2018/12/02/5c047e86951996c3c8cfc783/m_5c047eb945c8b3bb81c77363.jpg), it's about 6 years old at this point but in wonderful condition. The navy color makes it hard to wear in Spring when I want more light and airiness in my outfits and it's definitely too heavy for Summer.

I expect the packaging to be good for the price point but I was disappointed. Some shades just fell out of the pan as soon as I opened it. Also, there's a weird condensation on the mirror whenever I open it. I store them in a pretty dry place, idk what's the issue.

I use the taffeta coat way more often since it's easy to layer up underneath it, has a lot of pockets and features and is truly waterproof.

text:How Much Clothing Should I Own?	labels:Maybe try marking your clothes somehow. A safety pin/ribbon/backwards hangers or something similar. Then when you wear something, you remove the mark. After a period of time (6 months, a season, whatever works for you) you'll have a clear indicator of what you need. If you haven't worn it, you don't need it. Of course there's exceptions for stuff like funeral garb and ski gear, but it's a good benchmark.  Once you've cleared out what you don't wear, don't just replace it. Every time you go to buy an item, think about what it's going to replace. Do you have a gap in your wardrobe that you need to fill, or is it just something you like and want. If you want it, what are you going to get rid of and replace?  This is how I keep my wardrobe from expanding too much.  &#x200B;  As for what you need, I'd say two weeks worth of clothes. That way, when you get busy, you won't run out before you can do laundry.  For work, that might be 10 shirts, 6 ties, 4 suits, 4 pairs of shoes (depending on how much you have that matches).  Gym stuff, you might need 8 shirts, 8 pairs of shorts, 2 sweaters, one pair of shoes.  Casual clothes might be 14 t-shirts, assuming you change your shirt when you get home from work. 5 pairs of sweatpants/pyjama pants.  As for outerwear, that very much depends on climate but maybe 1 formal coat, for wearing over a suit. 3 nice sweaters, 2 casual sweaters/hoodies, one winter coat, 3 nice jackets.  &#x200B;  If you're concerned about getting rid of stuff you might want later and having to spend money replacing it, try removing all the stuff you want to get rid of from your closet/drawers and putting it in storage somewhere. If you catch yourself rummaging under the bed for that one sweater, you probably still need it. If it'd been there for a year, you can get rid of it.  &#x200B;  My closet is pretty sparse because I've gone from uni to working from home. I have 1 suit and tie, 1 nice shirt. I've got 3 nice casual shirts, 1 pair chinos, 1 pair jeans. For casual wear though I've got 15 t-shirts, 3 pairs sweats and 3 pairs PJs   It's so dependant on what you need on a day to day basis. Play about with taking stuff out of your wardrobe and putting it in storage to see what you really need

My clothes fits so much nicer and I feel more comfortable in them. I always need to get the waist taken in on pants and skirt. I also get dresses hemmed (cuz I‚Äôm short lol) and taken in if needed. Some of my blazers and blouses also gets taken in around the waist and shoulders. I have a small frame so most things off the rack fits just have a weird fit on me. Pretty much the only thing I don‚Äôt get tailored is my pj and athletic wear since I like the loose fit of those.   It took a while to find a tailor but she‚Äôs one of my favorite person ever. At this point she pretty much knows what I like what looks best on me so I let her do whatever she wants. I always keep in mind a budget for tailoring when I shop for clothes which helps with picking out only pieces I know I will love years down the line.	episode_done:True
text:My 2020 Clothing Challenge	labels:I love the idea of a limit, that's something I hope to impose next year.  It seems like this post is missing what you actually ARE wearing lately?  If you're not wearing the new items often, it doesn't seem to make sense to keep purchasing that type of item.  I guess it depends on the total size of your wardrobe, how many wears per item you expect. Two seems low to me, even for something I expect to only occasionally wear.
text:To be honest, with the quarantine I'm in my PJs or loungewear 95% of the time which is why I haven't worn any of my new items much. I haven't seen any friends or gone to work in about 8 months.

text:Summer outfit inspiration: An inspo album and 6 lessons on how to make complete outfits even when you are dying of heat stroke	labels:Great album! I definitely found some inspo there, especially the white dresses!  I'm from South Australia; our summers get brutally hot. (Although this year it's been... mild? Only a few days over 40 degrees?) So sometimes it's more about surviving than looking chic, or at least, chic-ly perspiring!  I'm always on the lookout for things I don't have to wear a bra with on really hot days, because cutting down even one layer helps me!! So tops with supporting/flattening bustlines (halters, crops etc) and big billowy skirts for max airflow. I have a small bust, so this may not be an option for everyone, I admit. Big floaty dresses, especially in linen or a great print, are an excellent option!   Natural fibres only, really, but even silk can get quite sweaty and show perspiration marks, so I avoid that. Clothes that can be easily washed and dried, and look good with minimal ironing.  A sunhat - I love vintage straws. A light linen long sleeve shirt for sun protection to go over everything. Statement sunglasses. Always thinking about being sun safe; sun damaged skin is my biggest fear!

text:Does change in climate = change in style?	labels:When I moved from a very seasonal American city to South East Asia, I for whatever reason thought that I _needed_ to live solely in very thin, very loose cottons and breezy skirts. I didn't bring a single pair of jeans or boots because I was fairly certain they would cause me to immediately melt into a puddle. For a period of time, I prioritized the heat over everything, so my style became really plain and blah, whereas I used to be fairly experimental back in the US.  Luckily, I then realized the key to dressing in the heat is just finding a balance. A thin turtleneck is fine with a skirt. Jeans and boots work fine with a tank top. Light weight blazer or loose oversized button-ups have replaced coats and sweaters, but still allow for some layering.   I've come to a good place with what I view my style as now, but I find that I do have to repeat a lot of basic "outfit formulas" and feel a bit envious of people who live in the cold and can layer to their hearts content. I think the cold weather lends itself to more creative combinations, whereas being stuck in perpetual summer makes me feel confined to a life of sun dresses.	episode_done:True

text:Has anyone else ever tried on a designer item just to see what the hype is about?	labels:Whenever people talk about designer being "worth it" or the prices "justified" - people get all twisted up in knots because worth is so subjective and hugely variant based on personal taste, exposure, and personal finances. It's common in these discussions for negative connotations of high end designer to sneak in. The unsaid being that the woman who thinks the price tag of high end designer is justified is snobby, materialistic, classist, wasteful, a show-off, out of touch, or at very minimum - their values are out of whack and have they first prioritized their family and their 401k?  So let's put worth aside and just talk about whether or not there is a noticeable difference in quality (both material and construction). The short answer is yes. And typically, the more expensive you go, the more noticeable it is.   So how do you explain the whole "I spent so much $$$ on _________ and it wasn't better than _________"?   I visualize clothing quality as one large spectrum, and each brand with its own mini-range of quality in between. Not every ‚Äúname brand‚Äù has good quality. Most vary quite a bit - some pieces being good, some bad. The good items overlap with brands at a higher price point, the bad items overlap with brands at a lower price point and once in awhile an item performs spectacularly or fails spectacularly. Some people put all ‚Äúluxe designer‚Äù at the far right/top of the spectrum - but like everything else, there are different ‚Äútiers‚Äù that correspond with price point [think LV vs. Gucci vs. Chanel vs. Hermes handbags]. But back to clothes, the variation in quality is especially noticeable in the $100-200 per piece category (Frame, Theory, Vince, A.P.C., ATM, Lafayette 148 NYC, Rebecca Taylor, Veronica Beard ...there‚Äôs so many). Once you get really up there (Akris Punto, St. John, Adam Lippes, Brunello Cuccinnelli, The Row, Celine, Dior etc. etc.), the tolerance for mediocre quality really decreases but doesn't completely disappear.  But what about [insert exception here]? Yep. There's plenty of outliers where the hype or marketing or styling overcomes quality or vice versa. Speaking of quality alone, Reformation is hugely overpriced and Hanes ultraweight cotton basics hugely underpriced. Some designers put quality first, some designers put innovation first, some brands dominate a particular niche, others are old names recently acquired and gutted by private equity.   And now add to that the ‚Äúhuman error‚Äù in quality perception. The people reviewing who forgot that they bought a made-for-outlet item (or who don‚Äôt make the distinction); the ones that don‚Äôt differentiate between main line and diffusion lines and thus conclude that Ralph Lauren is mediocre to based on RLRL,  the ones that define quality as ‚ÄúI threw it in the washer AND dryer and it came out fine;‚Äù the ones that paid full price and the ones that thrifted it at 10% of the cost and their different expectations accordingly. And then fundamentally, quality is often evaluated by looking backwards - when I say my [brand name] sweater held up perfectly over 10 years, I‚Äôm really speaking about the quality of the brand 10 years ago and not today.  Still, we can generally say that from a 9000 f.t. perspective, price and quality generally go hand in hand.   So what is someone new to fashion or who could never afford [insert high end designer] make of all of that? What is "good," "bad", or "worth it"? I for one am a huge proponent of going to fancy stores (or even just the fancy corner of Nordstrom, Bloomingdales, or Saks) and just feeling the fabrics on the rack. Pre-COVID, I'd do this all the time. I really believe that anyone with no special knowledge of fabrics or construction can still quickly pick out high end designer pieces by feel alone, eyes closed. It's even better if you try on a piece or two. It's even better if you turn the shirt inside out and notice the hems, the clasps, the bias cut, the darting, the difference made by ‚Äúfully lined.‚Äù Maybe it inspires you to thrift. Maybe it helps you pick out the "good" for brands in your price range. Maybe it gets you to think about what makes this piece work? What do I like about it? What do I dislike? What clever things did the designer do? Or didn't do? There is really no substitute for seeing and feeling yourself.   I think the biggest barrier for many people trying this out is judgement. Sometimes it's imagined, sometimes it's real. I've definitely had sales associates not-subtly ask where I live, whether I own or rent, what I do for a living, etc. Sometimes they ignore me entirely. Sometimes they follow me around the store. Sometimes they are absolutely fantastic and helpful and I'm just having a negative-internal-dialogue day. Some people don't find it at all intimidating, others can brush that stuff off - I can on good days, can't on bad. If this is something you're interested in, high end consignment stores (or even normal thrift stores in very high end neighborhoods) are the bomb for a casual atmosphere and the opportunity to touch and feel the hell out of some really nice stuff.

text:For the parents of girls	labels:I have a 7 week old and currently she really only wears footie pajamas. We have cute baby clothes for her, but pajamas all day is just easier. Don't have to worry about socks falling off or pants pulling down her diaper. Also Dad dresses her in the morning so I can sleep in after night feeding.  When she gets older, my plan is to let her decide how much fashion help she wants from me. I wasn't into fashion when I was a kid, plus I had body image issues and didn't feel good in the popular clothes of the 00's. Low rise jeans and skimpy shirts are not great for a chubby kid. So my goal is to make sure she always feels good in her clothes and about her body (at least as much as a teenage girl can).

text:What is your one clothing item that makes your life better that everyone should have?	labels:I literally wrote out a whole reply to this then the reddit app crashed and deleted it and I'm *back* to try and remember what I said. I also got black Doc Marten chelseas at the start of October (with the stitching though, I used to live in Camden and I like the little nod to punk history) and I'm obsessed with them. They're the perfect mix of sleek and chunky and I can wear them and a long black coat I thrifted last year to make absolutely any outfit look so folk witchy. I'm growing out a shaved head and I started tying bandannas on to flatten it down when it first started to go fluffy, and now I wear full on big flowing floral hair scarves in [this](https://pin.it/2JSODxF) kind of style but with the longer tails cascading over one or both shoulders (I'm Turkish so it's a nice way to feel more connected to that as well, since I live in the UK; this way of tying the scarves is quite folk Turkish/Balkan and a way of keeping your hair back in a pretty way for the sake of practicality, not religious in nature). I have a few smaller cotton scarves with the flower trim like she's wearing (yemenis) too, but the ones I wear at the moment are bigger and wool so warmer; I've always worn the yemenis to keep hair off my sweaty face in the summer. When I first video called my mum with a scarf identical to [this one](https://www.google.com/shopping/product/1395844627875796894/image?q=vintage+yellow+Russian+scarf&client=ms-android-huawei-rev1&prmd=isvn&sxsrf=ALeKk006xqEigIyO-Y0HhcSHeLlg0oHcfg:1606924336872&biw=360&bih=699&dpr=3&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj-zqTt06_tAhX5RxUIHZyeBgUQnUAIxwI&prds=cid%3A1395844627875796894%2Ccs%3A1%2Csgro%3Aiv%2Cmvi%3A0) on, which I found in a charity shop years back, she started laughing and said I looked like the Bulgarian housekeepers in the town she's from, but people here think it's very pretty and sophisticated which I find quite funny as for Turkish and I imagine many other balkan women it's the equivalent of a sweatband you wear while you're vacuuming or whatever and cooking to keep your hair out of your face.   Anyway, I just love those boots for the practical but stylish element they add to any outfit (just like the hair scarves!) and that yellow stitching is amazing for pulling them into my palettes, as I don't tend to wear much black and I'm obsessed with matching my colours.	episode_done:True

text:What did your mom teach you about fashion/style - and what did she not teach you?	labels:My mom was adamant that I was not allowed to own more that one of each clothing item. So if I had a favorite shirt I was not allowed to buy it in another color, or worse, own two of them. I think she was trying to emphasize quality over quantity, but it greatly backfired. It did not help that she and I never agreed on what I should wear (she wanted me to love pink, frills, and sparkles and I wanted to love black and neutrals). She always won though, because as she would say, ‚ÄúI make the money so I make the decisions.‚Äù   The second I had my own place and my own paycheck, I started buying backups of my favorite clothes and shoes. It became extremely hard for me to let go of anything and it became my excuse to hoard things I liked.   I only started to see the light in my late 20s, and now that I‚Äôm in my 30s I‚Äôve finally mostly got it under control. I still buy multiple of things that I love (like a pair of jeans that fits me perfectly) but I try not to go overboard. And I still like black and neutrals!

text:How do you balance bright statement pieces with a capsule wardrobe?	labels:I am like you - I like colors and patterns. A super minimal capsule wouldn't work for me at all. As a thought exercise, I considered what I would limit my wardrobe to.  I have a pretty limited color palette, though I am adding a little bit. My neutrals have hisrtoriclally been grey and black. I recently added millennial pink to the list.  I am now adding taupe/olive and mustard to my neutrals. My colors are basically hot pink and fuchsia (various shades) and burgundy.  I retired cobalt blue from the list.   So all of my patterned stuff has one of neutrals and my accent colors. So they feel pretty cohesive.   This is what my edit might look like, based on what I wear the most. There is no way I could get down to 20 items, but 50ish is my number!  * I wear a lot of dresses, so my capsule would have probably 8-12 dresses    * 3-4 "work"    * 3-4 "casual"    * 1-2 formal    * 1-2 "travel" * 3-4 skirts (at the moment I am loving midi skirts) * 2-4 leggings/joggers that are not for the gym * 3 blazers: one patterned, one colorful, one neutral * 3 cardigans: dark neutral, light neutral, colorful * 2 jeans: one dark skinny, one light to medium straight leg * 2-3 pants in my colors * 2-3 layering tops * 4-6 solid blouses/tee shirts in my colors * 3-4 patterned blouses * 3-5 sweaters/sweatshirts  * 1-2 jumpsuits: one patterned, one solid * rain jacket * cold weather jacket * casual jacket * sporty jacket  My take is, feel free to set your own neutrals.  You may not need more than one traditional one.  In my wardrobe I find that burgundy, mustard, and light pink basically go with everything anyway! So they can be used in place of a traditional neutral. I also found once I was picky about the colors in my patterns, they were so much easier to mix into my wardrobe.    My patterns are generally black and white or have some pink. So it is really easy to pair them with my pink items. Burgundy looks great with them all too. At the moment I want to wear more solids, and I am working on filling in my wardrobe with solids in my accent colors (and not the neutrals).  I'll probably slowly purge my wardrobe in the coming years and further hone in and eliminate duplicates, but I won't give up colors and patterns!
text:Thanks for the detailed reply! My issue with having a lot of clothing isn't that I don't want it, but that I'll be moving overseas at the start of the year and will only be able to bring 1 duffel bag of clothes, including shoes. I'll try to wear as much as I can while we travel so I can bring a bit more, but I'll be very limited on space, hence me trying to get outfit sets as much as possible before then. I would love to bring a bunch of cute statement pieces but I also don't want to look like a toddler who dressed herself! LOL	labels:LOL! What I would do I guess is multi-fold, depending on your circumstances.  * for those memorable items, but you don't need to wear often. put them in storage. I am lucky and that stuff, in small amounts could go to my parents or sister's place in this hypothetical scenario * I'd set a budget for new stuff (the basics)    * I'd probably not bring my winter coat (assuming it is needed) and get a new one there or wear it on the plane. Or I'd skip my rain coat because it takes a lot of space    * I'd not bring really any t shirts or layering tanks, maybe one. Because these are easy to replace    * No socks besides a couple workout ones, a few fave unique pairs, and like one normal pair for backup * I'd spend 1/3 of the space on my absolute favorite items I love to wear and wold be hard to replace of find similar things that I'd love. For me, right now, that would include:     * my fave floral dress that is 10 years old    * my satin bomber jacket    * my floral blazer    * my pink blazer    * one of my midi skirts    * 2 of my black and white printed dresses * I'd spend another 1/3 to 1/2 on the versatile staples I love and would not want to put a lot of work in to finding a similarly great one.    * the jeans that fit because jeans are annoying to shop for (one straight, one skinny)    * fave leggings or joggers    * a couple of my fave blouses * After evaluating what got stuck in the suitcase, I'd add some more stuff based on the season I am currently in (or now a few more fall things since we are about to switch * I am an absolute shoeoholic. So I'd optimize based on how I prioritize for travel    * dressy shoe    * sandal    * all day walkable     * boots (I'd wear on the plane)    * nice flats    * wild card shoe    * sneaker (workout or casual)  Also, make sure you get really good at rolling your clothes and maybe even do the vacuum seal thing. I certainly would to fit more things lol..	episode_done:True

text:What do YOU do with "chub rub" jeans?	labels:So, I'm a personal stylist that specializes in fitting women's denim. In my experience, the useable lifespan of a pair of jeans is about 2 years. Some will hold up longer than that (usually the higher the cotton amount, the longer they will last), but when you're talking middle-of-the-road quality with blended fabric, the two year mark is where you'll start to see warping, color fade, stress on the hardware, but most tragically, crotch breakdown. And this is across the board for women of all shapes and sizes. It's just that the area is subject to constant friction but a lot of my clients worry that it's due to their shape. It's not.  As I mentioned above, probably the best defense is shopping for denim that has a higher cotton percentage, like 98% or more. I have two pairs of 100% cotton vintage Levi's that are 35 and 25 years old respectively with no crotch wear. The caveat is the more cotton content, the less your jeans will stretch. They will mold to your body... but they will not stretch. And you're limited in styles. There aren't really any 100% cotton skinny jeans, at least none that work well for most people so you're kind of limited to that mom/boyfriend/straight style fit.  The second thing you can do is be gentle in caring for your jeans. There are some diehards who never wash their denim. This is a little silly when you're talking non-raw or non-selvedge denim. Please wash your jeans. But I recommend getting a gentle detergent (woolite), do not use fabric softener (actually you shouldn't use it period), wash on cold, gentle cycle inside out, and hang to dry. This is especially important if you are dealing with blended fabric since the stretch fibers will break down when exposed to heat. I recommend washing every 5 or so wears. If you need to freshen up between washes you can toss them in the dryer on low with a handful of ice cubes and a dryer sheet for 15 minutes or until the ice stops rattling. This shouldn't be too damaging since you're not drying saturated fabric for 45+ minutes but it will reset the shape (especially for stretch jeans that are starting to warp and/or sag) and knock out any smell.  For repair, the sooner you address a hole the better. You may be able to self-patch up a hole that's smaller than two fingers through it. If you're crafty, get out the sewing machine and sew what you can. A quick YouTube search will turn up tutorials that are better than anything I could attempt to describe here. You could also patch from the inside and sew everything closed with a little reinforcement. But if the surrounding fabric is starting to degrade or if the hole is big and/or in a conspicuous spot, you really only have one option other than retiring those jeans.  In terms of repair beyond two fingers, the best way to do it for a pair of jeans that you CANNOT bear to part with is to send them to be rewoven. I only know of [one company that does this well](https://www.denimrepair.com/) but it's not exactly cheap ($45 + shipping) so I would really evaluate any denim that you get re-woven. In 20 years I've only had 2 pairs re-woven. It also only really buys you a few more months with stretch denim, maybe a year or two with a higher cotton count. With blended denim, it may just be best to total them. Give them a viking funeral.  All in all, I think your best bet is to just sort of accept that most of your jeans will only last about 2 years. Oh, and when they stop fitting correctly, don't be so hard on yourselves. A lot of the time, jeans will stop fitting because their fabric is warping from being worn and washed. A good way to find jeans that fit is to look based on your height (which will tell you inseam and rise, first and foremost). Most women don't know what their height translates to in terms of those measurements though even though this is one of the biggest reason jeans "don't fit." [This has helped me sort out jeans that will fit in the length and rise for a client.](https://project-fit-mvp.herokuapp.com/) Then I just need to find something they'll like and select their size. It's not pretty but it does like 90% of my styling job by only showing stuff that's going to fit.
text:I dunno. I can chub-rub the hell out of pants in 3-6 months. 2 years is like an extremely good pair of jeans. I wish. I'm not buying super cheap jeans, but good ones that fit are HARD to find. I don't want to pay $70/pair. It's ridiculous. And for them to get those holes, it's such a PITA.  I remember jeans USED to fit well and used to last. I'm so bitter about the chub rub ones. I've tried just about everything. I walk a lot though. It happens, which might be part of it. I don't over-launder them. Like I'm already following most of the tips you provided, and they're not lasting.  I do what the OP said and save them for the winter with leggings underneath, or just for yard work or wear around the house when I need to wear jeans but don't care about though exposure.  I've seen chicks who just wear them. Those ladies have given me confidence to just go for it, most of the time. I won't wear them to work, but everywhere else - happy birthday? I guess?   I can't afford to have to replace my jeans *that* often. It's ridiculous.	labels:I also walk a lot. And used to bicycle a *lot.* Also I‚Äôm a bigger person with proportionally large thighs (partly because of the aforementioned bicycling).  Losing 30 lbs basically tripled the lifespan of my pants. I‚Äôm not kidding. I used to be lucky to get a year out of a pair, now they last 3+ years. They still wear out in the crotch but now it happens around the same time other parts are getting heavily worn down too.  I‚Äôm not advocating anyone lose weight to make their jeans last longer. My weight loss was for completely unrelated health reasons. But It‚Äôs silly to pretend that activities and body shape/size don‚Äôt play a role in how clothes break down.	episode_done:True

text:Riches to rags: The myth of sustainable fashion (The Financial Times).	labels:tldr (although worth reading the whole article since I left stuff out)  Words such as sustainable, vegan, eco, and conscious have quadrupled in use in the US and Britain according to Edited, a London based retail analytics company. These practices are *not* sustainable, as companies keep expanding and the volume of apparel and footwear being produced is forecast to increase by 81 per cent to 102 million tons by 2030 according to a report by the Global Fashion Agenda in Copenhagen and the Boston Consulting Group. It also found that companies are slowing down their progress on carbon reduction and worker's rights by 30 per cent in 2019 than the year before.  Sustainable is not a regulated term unlike "organic" and "free range" in the food industry, so brands can use that term in any way they want; in this case it is used as PR marketing. It is also extremely difficult to map out supply chains, as brands have moved away from running their own factories and the like, to outsourcing production to thousands of overseas factories where they lose oversight and ownership of their supply lines. This is due to globalization and trade policies.  Companies also use sustainable fashion as a marketing term, rather than solving problems for actual long term sustainability. They also control what sort of information is released amongst consumers, resulting in a sea of misinformation that is created by brands. Legislators don't view this problem as an important issue, and instead focus on other issues.  Some practices are being adopted by few brands, with "carbon-neutral shows" being adopted where they offset their carbon emissions by donating to forest restoration projects. Other brands have aggressive targets to reduce and offset their carbon output.  While it is tempting for consumers to leave this responsibility to brands, consumers also play a role in this. Patagonia's Weller believes people need to block cognitive dissonance for a second to know buying so much clothes is excessive. He also believes people need to think differently about stuff and see it as a meaningful possession worth taking care of.  Actions for consumers:  - Buy less stuff, wear them longer - Buy second hand - Research before buying - Avoid synthetic fabrics - Wash clothes less often and use cold water - Think about what will happen to a product at the end of its life cycle
text:I know that this is a controversial opinion but realistically consumer actions will have very  little impact on industry at large, really the best and only thing you can do is, to become politically active and support candidate who will defend the environment.	labels:> realistically consumer actions will have very little impact on industry at large  This is both incredibly true and valid and also not as much. If you're looking at say water usage over the lifecycle of a garment, consumers are to blame for most of it. If you're talking about wasted clothes from fast fashion companies being burned or trashed because that's their business then you're absolutely correct.   I think the actions for consumers are valid in this case, especially hobbyists that participate in fashion as a luxury hobby rather than a societal obligation. Even more so things like washing clothes less often and using cold water, that doesn't even really have an impact on your life.	episode_done:True

text:Buying vs selling on resell websites	labels:I bought/sold on Poshmark when it was starting to get popular, and found great deals and sold pretty easily on it. I stopped a year later - by that time, I had started seeing wholesale distributers flooding the site and making it alot harder for me to find actual used clothing for decent prices. I'd agree that there are likely too many sellers now compared to buyers - or at least too much merchandise compared to buyers. To me, that makes Poshmark too much like Ebay, and is no longer as distinct a platform as it used to be.  Edit: typos
text:I agree. I like buying secondhand mostly so I used to use Posh/etc a tooooon and have pretty much stopped. I actually find better deals on eBay now for the same things. Sellers want to charge full retail (or more) for items and act like negotiating is a personal attack when that's literally what the site was designed for. Couple that with expensive shipping, no returns, and the high occurrence of issues with orders it just isn't worth it. The last time I was on this site was the summer and everything that I made reasonable offers is still sitting, now cheaper than what I originally offered, and because the sellers gave me attitude they lost my sale. I don't see Posh being successful for much longer, honestly. Mercari is just as bad and harder to find things on.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Fast Fashion: What are your wardrobe all-stars?	labels:Ooooo! I know, I have a black knee-length skirt from H&M that‚Äôs about five -six years old. Its held up well compared to my other fast fashion pieces, most of them fall apart from 1-2 years of wear.  The material is 69% viscose and 29% polyester, and I got it on sale for $14.

She has EXTREMELY HELPFUL edits on her Instagram and website on how to use fashion pieces. She pulls in dozens of examples from all different price points and shows how they look on different body types. She even recommends different cuts based on body types. As a professional woman in my late 20s, I've found her hands down the most stylish, yet professional "influencer." She's actually a professional stylist (Katie Holmes is a big client of hers!). She does virtual styling appointments for regular nobodies (like me) where she helps you figure out how to wear pieces in your wardrobe and sends you a bunch of pieces she thinks would really add versatility. She's all about maximizing the wear out of a few pieces. Finding her this year has dramatically changed how I approach clothes!

text:Can you have a clothing style without actually wearing that certain style much?	labels:I think if you find a style appealing but don't actually wear it, it's not technically your style. Like I really appreciate romantic styles with volume, lace, ruffles, drama, etc but I rare wear clothes that could be described as romantic because it doesn't feel appropriate for work. I wouldn't describe my style as romantic, despite window shopping on the Oscar de la Renta site a lot.   But! I also don't really put a lot of thought into what my style is or what I think it is - I wear what makes me happy. While I do find value in expressing my personality in clothes, I try not to get too caught up in what it means or this mindset that if my style changes, who I am as a person changes.  I think your situation is different because you live at home and don't have quite as much freedom to choose what you can wear, so that gets a pass. It's quite possible that if you had the ability and freedom to wear what you wanted, you'd wear more alternative clothing.
text:[deleted]	labels:Hard agree. I‚Äôm 5 months pregnant, a SAHW, and am currently wearing a rotation of leggings, tunics, and sweaters.   Does this mean it‚Äôs my sense of style? No, I have never been a leggings and tunics kind of gal. I love dressing up and will take any occasion to, including going to the post office. But between covid and pregnancy, there‚Äôs not a lot of reason to dress up.  In life, the moments we are in dictate the appropriateness of our clothing. Sounds like the moment OP is in is limiting their personal style, but someday those limitations will disappear and they will be able to explore and embrace it fully.	episode_done:True

Because of the hair thing, she wears them inside too. it never seems rude or weird, they just are a part of her every day imsge. She also swears they keep her head warm in winter but idkk  I can only get the beanie-with-a-pompom look to work for me. I'm trying to branch out but I haven't found anything that works on me and fits with at least 5 outfits (I don't want a huge hat collection so I'm looking for things pretty universal). Also trying to keep my ears warm.  What kind of hard are you looking at/are you using any methods around face shape or proportions to make your decisions?

text:Model poses while online shopping	labels:there are certain poses which I look for that I KNOW means the garment is shit or has a lousy fit. An extreme lean back, tugging on the clothing, hands aggressively shoved into pockets, any sort of jump that means you don't know how long the top is.. probably more I'm missing.
text:The one I particularly hate is when the model is billowing out the skirt, or grabbing the hem of a swingy jacket and holding it out or way up.  I wear a lot of goth stuff, and there's a lot of bell-sleeve and flowy cape anime running and I am over it.  Put it down, sit still. I just wanna see the fit.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 09, 2021	labels:## How do you wear a mac coat?  A mac coat is designed for rain, and comes in water repellent fabrics... It is touted as a very versatile coat. Great! I have even found one I really like.  But for something to wear in the rain; it lacks a hood for head protection. You wouldn't want to go out in the rain with your head exposed.  So are you expected to always combine it with an umbrella?   I haven't had a proper coat for rain before (made do with a parka or an umbrella) so the lack of head protection is surprising; unless you go for a more technical raincoat.
text:To my mind the best way to stay dry (other than not going out, lol) is an umbrella. The coat is there for what gets part the umbrella.  You can buy waterproof hats from companies like Barbour and Orvis, as well as using a regular ball cap, too.	labels:[deleted]	episode_done:True
text:How do some people put outfits together so effortlessly. Fashionista's please help.	labels:Any outfit can look great if the fundamentals are solid. These people that can ‚Äújust throw anything on‚Äù and look great usually have a polished base.   If you make a point to look put together ie. your hair/makeup/skin/nails look clean, your clothes are ironed and in good condition and fit you well then that‚Äôs the main battle.   I like to experiment by pattern clashing, wearing vintage finds and bright colours, and I find that anything really goes if you have the confidence and polish to pull it off.   And like others have said: practice. Have a fashion show just for yourself at home and get creative with what you already have! It‚Äôs fun and liberating.	episode_done:True
text:Do you guys default to a set of a few pieces even though you own a ton?	labels:I never expected my suits to get frequent wear. COVID changes have meant that my bizcas stuff doesn't get much wear. Less social activity means I've been wearing mostly my casual items that I like the least. I'm not comfortable just getting rid of decent stuff, but I've narrowed my vision for what I want my wardrobe to look like; so when I don't really have anywhere to go I'll just add the mileage to my "whatever" items rather than the keepers that fit my goals.  The counter argument is "life is short, clothes are (can be) relatively cheap, why not just wear the stuff you enjoy?" That sounds like better advice, so I'm not sure I'd advise anyone to do what I do.
text:Yeah. COVID has def thrown a curve ball. I still think it's important to put in effort even if just running an errand. At least that's what I'm conflicted by "wearing out my clothes" vs using it as an opportunity to experiment.  &#x200B;  Most people these days don't really care about what they wear or even own suits (not that suits are the end all be all). I guess I'm coming to terms with the fact that I do care about my clothes and fashion and that I want to wear suits. I want to put in a ton of effort into learning more and more and I believe "practice makes perfect". In that sense COVID has been a positive for me. I get to go out very quickly without "committing" every single day.  I have a bit more time without a commute so I am lucky. I haven't really done this as much as I should but I should be trying out things a bit more. I have done it a few times but not every day. Realistically I could see how all kinds of clothes fit with each other and how they feel to wear throughout the day.  &#x200B;  I do like the counter argument a lot more even if I'm more or less doing a bit more of what it sounds like you are doing. Life really is too short and as we all now know, the world can change in an instant.	labels:I don't feel the need to put effort in if running an errand in a mask. It's possible that attitude has a subtle cost though, so I'll chalk it up as reason #346 to hope things get better soon.  As far as caring more about style than some of those around you, or wanting to wear suits casually or something bold: I'm not sure where you live, but in a big enough city you can just do that. The large population assures that you'll see people every day who dress with intention, and others who dress for shock, artistry, trendiness, attention, or whatever; and also that they do so in relative anonymity.  Now I'm not saying you can't do that in a small town, but I know that people would get more hung up on it. And if you dressed in a way that was more aspirational than suited to your lifestyle, then other people would know it. That's a tough situation, and it might take a thick skin and a willingness to be derided as eccentric  (and possibly gay) if a rural guy has style goals other than being a chameleon.   But here in the city it's not hard to set "eccentric" as a long term goal. No one cares!	episode_done:True
text:What clothing items have you reverted back to since WFH/quarantine?	labels:I have a confession. I have Christmas slippers that I bought in the after Christmas sale at Land End.

text:Have you ever gone out on a limb and bought clothing from an unknown brand advertised on Instagram/Facebook/online? How did it work out?	labels:I got some bodysuits from romwe.  They fit weird in the back waist, but I got them to wear under long blazers so it‚Äôs fine.  They actually look really nice and I have a really tough time finding bodysuits long enough for me.  I might pick up a couple more.  I was especially satisfied with the white one, I can wear non-nude bras under it without issue, and they‚Äôre thick enough that I can go braless too.  I get a lot of wear out of them and I would call them a staple. Pleasantly surprised.	episode_done:True
text:Dream Unconventional/ Unrealistic Fashion Accessories- Discussion	labels:I look amazing in hats, but everything about my style comfort zone is low-effort/minimalist.

text:What's your fashion tragedy?	labels:We had a moth infestation over COVID. Normally it wouldn‚Äôt have happened, but suddenly we both stopped our suit-wearing office jobs and put all of our wool dress clothes, blazers, cashmere sweaters etc. away in a dark corner of our walk-in closet starting in March.   Then by the time we saw a moth flying around in July, the moths had already eaten holes in several items. They love the expensive stuff - cashmere, wool suits, wool coats. Our cheapie casual stuff? Our polyester athleisure? Ha, hard pass and straight for the Max Mara jacket. It cost ~ two thousand dollars in damage (two of my husband‚Äôs suits, one of mine, one dress, 3 dress pants, 3 cashmere sweaters, a wool coat); drycleaning, moth prevention and extermination combined. And it took an amazing amount of time - we had to move everything out of our closet, wash, freeze, bake and/or dryclean everything, then I probably purchased every single not-too-toxic pest control item known to man (incl. some moderately toxic bug bombs which we then had to air out our home for a few days). I think I spent about $120 just on garment bags alone. Then the buggers moved to our other closet and we repeated that process for the entry way closet. Finally had the exterminator come twice and it seems to be under control.  Quite honestly a two month nightmare, and no, not covered by homeowners insurance. We managed to get two holes rewoven (a very high level highly technical skill that only very good tailors know how to do and was $60 per hole) on two peices. I learned how to darn and fix holes in looser knits and weaves like sweaters. But god. It was so horrible.  My husband had particularly expensive stuff affected, but actually I lost more because I had more things that were just in the realm of ‚Äúis this worth $60 to repair and $20 to dry clean?‚Äù and ended up deciding no on a few of them so ended up tossing. Also one of my cashmere sweaters, though not cheap, was honestly beyond repair.

text:I will now be religious about checking for moths!	labels:FYI- the moths that eat clothes are flightless, and it's actually their larvae that do the eating. So just because you're not seeing moths flying around doesn't mean you don't have sweater eating moths.   Cedar trunks are great for keeping them completely out, or cedar balls and lavender sachets for repelling them. In super valuable wardrobes it's worthwhile to be religious about washing/dry cleaning EVERYTHING before it goes back in, even after one wear. The moths will also eat anything with human sweat so just because something is polyester doesn't mean it can't attract them.	episode_done:True
text:Fall/winter shoe trends: what's your dream wishlist?	labels:I think I'm going to buy these [Thursday Boots](https://thursdayboots.com/products/womens-captain-boot-arizona-adobe) this fall.  I've been hearing good things about these as far as comfort and quality goes and I think they'll be very versatile for my lifestyle.
text:As a cautionary tale, I bought a pair of Thursdays last fall (specifically the Duchess boots) and despite loving the aesthetics I'm pretty disappointed with them. They have developed waaaay more scuffs and creases (and one straight up nick in the leather) than any other leather boots I have (across a variety of price ranges), and even after the break-in period I find them fairly uncomfortable to walk in for long periods.  (unrelated but I bought them from their B&M store in NYC and it was the most unpleasant buying experience I've ever had, I don't think I've ever encountered salespeople who were so pushy, rude, and straight-up mean)	labels:Oh no I'm so sad to hear you had such a bad experience with Thursdays! I was literally just doing a shoe assessment and realised the majority of my boots are Thursdays. I've had two pairs of Duchesses for nearly 2yrs (bought in a sample sale) and they definitely have gotten scuffed, but that's actually what makes my boots look like they have character. Totally agree with you about the long break-in period, (my "hack" for that was to step on the shoes over and over for a day or two) but I feel like once I broke them in they became my most comfortable shoes.  I recently (last winter, pre-COVID days) got [these Highline's](https://thursdayboots.com/products/womens-highline-boot-olive-suede?collection=womens-boots-booties) and was iffy at first because they're suede and I live in NYC and I love to walk. Suede boots and city streets are a match made in hell but these boots are still stupidly clean.  I've got two more pairs of Thursdays ([white Heartbreakers](https://thursdayboots.com/products/womens-heartbreaker-high-heel-bootie-white?collection=womens-boots-booties) and a pair that's been discontinued) and absolutely love Thursdays, and I guess that's why it makes me so sad to find out that this thing that's brought me so much joy (footwear-wise at least) wasn't able to do the same to others. :(	episode_done:True

text:Chicago, too, and as a kid Mom would make me wear plastic bags on my feet before my boots to keep my socks dry.  Long before waterproof boots existed (or we could afford them).

text:Does anyone take their ‚Äúpower color‚Äù really seriously? Basing a whole wardrobe around one color - not just choosing an accent color for a neutral capsule?	labels:My mum's wardrobe is probably 85% shades of blue, even down to her shoes. She has navy brogues. The other 15% are all things that that go with the navy stuff. It seems more accidental and  because 'blue really suits me'	episode_done:True
text:My 2020 Clothing Challenge	labels:I like the idea of the challenge but I don't get how something can be a hit if you wore it only once or twice in months..
text:I don't think that's too unreasonable. I have a skirt that I wear maybe three times a year but absolutely love. It's just a very, very noticeable piece and would feel odd wearing it often. I think it's also fair to have special pieces or things you really love get saved for times when you're in the mood for them. I think a 'hit' can mean different things in that regard!	labels:OP's initial goal is to consider her closet additions more and stop shopping mindlessly. Yet most of these purchases are explained as such: "There was a sale", "it seemed like a no brain buy", "it was discounted", "I saw it and knew I had to have it", "I have a soft spot for X so I buy another duplicate".   I fail to see how the initial goal was achieved.  I understand special or statement items and I have a few of them in my closet too. But they are not the last 5 purchases I made.  I think the satin pants are the only item that actually reached her goal of upgrading her wardrobe with nicer pieces that she loves. Yet she didn't love them enough to get them cleaned.	episode_done:True
text:What is your "White Whale" fashion product that apparently doesn't exist?	labels:Olive utility jacket. I see hundreds of these every fall and yet none of them fit as well as one I bought from H&M around 2014-2015 but ended up returning bc I felt guilty for spending the money. I‚Äôm small so that might be why the other jackets don‚Äôt fit as well. I still regret returning it (only $40) because I‚Äôd spend $100 now to find one with a similar fit, and I‚Äôve been looking for the perfect one for the last five years.

Then it gets even more boring compared to some of yours, I‚Äôd probably just work on a great capsule wardrobe with a few key pieces and mostly casual day-to-day items.

text:If you had $5,000 to What-Not-To-Wear style re-do your whole wardrobe, how would you do it? What would be your process?

I don't think I'd willingly trade in my wardrobe for $5000 to restyle.   If my loved ones staged an intervention and had me redo it, it depends on the lifestyle. I think I'd put a few basics like a suit, button shirt and a nice pair of loafers, and then address the casual look... but secretly, I just want to have a stash of tea dresses like *Picnic at Hanging Rock*.	episode_done:True
text:Help needed for buying jeans online! All advice is welcome!	labels:I bought jeans from Everlane and they fit well. They have a lot of customer reviews and you can filter for customers who have a similar size to you. Well worth it.
text:Agreed! I know they're cancelled now, but before they were, being able to filter the reviews by height & weight that was similar to mine never steered me in the wrong direction! I find that their jeans are high quality for the price point and are also easily found on poshmark & depop.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:When/why did you get your first really fancy purse/bag?	labels:I bought a Celine nano luggage in an intense e bay auction my senior year of college. I was working in a restaurant to get through school so it was really easy to save a few bucks out of my cash tips each night. I‚Äôve always loved admiring designer bags and fell in love with the classic look of the nano but knew I could never justify the full price (nor did I want to wait that long ‚Äî it would have taken me a while to save $2,700 + tax). I knew the signs for knockoffs and vetted it heavily online, and then when it came in I had it authenticated in person immediately just to be safe. e bay also offers a 12 day guarantee and prohibits the sale of replicas, so I knew if it turned out to be fake I could open a case and get my money back with no problems, but fortunately I didn‚Äôt need to pursue that option. Anyways, this was over two years ago and I‚Äôm still over the moon with my purchase.  I‚Äôve since bought the Burberry medium banner in black with the classic check sides. Another one I had been in love with forever. Preparing to leave college, I wanted a nice bag that wasn‚Äôt too flashy and could fit a laptop and a notebook. The banners available secondhand were barely cheaper, maybe like $300 at most, and looked like crap so I saved a lot longer for that one (same method as before) and bought it full price from the store (pro tip: I had it shipped to my hometown, which is in a state that does not have a Burberry, so I did not have to pay any sales tax). Then about a year ago I bought a beautiful black velvet Prada bag secondhand after I got screwed over in scheduling and ended up being the only person on shift for an 80 guest happy hour, all while working on a broken foot ‚Äî I made $800 in tips and immediately bought the Prada bag secondhand to become my fancy bag for events and such.  Between those three bags I have all my bases covered and don‚Äôt feel the need to admire any others with any real intent to save for it. I‚Äôve got the Celine nano for summery stuff (it‚Äôs the smooth leather in terracotta), the medium Burberry banner for work (I‚Äôm no longer in restaurants so this is my office bag), and the black velvet Prada for date nights and formal events. Since I bought two of them secondhand I‚Äôve spent a total of $2,500 between the three and I don‚Äôt regret a penny, and the collection is worth upwards of $5,000, so it‚Äôs ‚Äúfrugal‚Äù for what it is. That said, it was easy for me to save at the time because I was making good money and since I was working nights and weekends I never really had the opportunity to spend that money on things like bar crawls or brunches.	episode_done:True

I googled bleaching and painting leather but didn‚Äôt find much, save for info explaining that common cleaning bleach would degrade the fabric.

text:Depending on where you move to, there may be local thrift stores in your area that carry high quality second hand coats for significantly less than full price.  I think most of my favorite winter gear has come from second hand stores, including multiple winter coats, fleece and wool layering sweaters, heavy duty winter boots, etc.   My favorite cold weather brands to keep an eye out for when I‚Äôm thrifting are: - Patagonia (jackets and fleeces) - Sorel (winter boots) - Marmot (jackets and fleeces) ... my current winter coat is a knee-length puffy Marmot - Mountain Hardware (hats and gloves) - REI (fleeces) - The North Face (jackets and fleeces)  Edit: Just because these are my preferred types of items from these brands doesn't mean that their other items aren't worth checking out as well! All of these brands produce solid cold weather gear, and if you're ever in doubt you can google a specific item to see what people are saying about it online.   Also, as u/BeeVoltage pointed out, be cautious about going second hand for your waterproof layer and try to stick to items with tags still on them or that were released recently as waterproofing does wear out over time.	labels:You can find all of these things on poshmark, right after Christmas is a great time to get NWT for less than the store.	episode_done:True
text:Formula for a put together outfit that works for most aesthetics	labels:This is interesting! Here's my breakdown for today, for the little bit of time I braved the great outdoors:  * Knit jumper (hiding plain tee under it): 1 * Velvet skirt: 1 * Coloured tights: 1 * Boots: 1 * Parka: 1 (Not sure if/how this counts since it hides everything under it?) * Patterned bag: 2 * Minimal necklace + stud earrings: 1 * Little patterned hair clip + mascara: 1 (maybe this should merge with the jewellery?)  For a fairly plain outfit, a 9 feels quite high. I wonder whether layering for bad weather has thrown it off a bit. I don't really count umbrellas and face masks but they're awkward because they come and go depending on the context.  It's an interesting idea that black tights or a plain dress would effectively tone it down, giving more capacity for, say, louder shoes or bolder earrings. I'm not sure I'd opt in to tallying up items every day but I will bear the idea of trading simple and complex components in mind.
text:yes that is interesting! I do think for bad weather in both summer and winter, it would probably make sense to either lower the bar for numbers (if it's hellish hot, maybe down to 6?) or raise it for cold weather. For example do tights / leggings count as a point? a parka? I think you're onto something with the ubiquity of winter items... but there are definitely winter items that are not neutral. Like maybe black gloves in the snow aren't a point, but bright knitted ones definitely are. Or you judge the look based on the indoor appeal, once the weatherproofing stuff is in the coat room.	labels:Yeah, I wonder whether you'd need to judge it layer-by-layer, in the sense that the coat, gloves, hat, scarf and bag form a different "outfit" to what you get if you take them off and see the dress, cardigan and necklace underneath instead.  That's getting rather complicated though :-D I like the idea of judging it on the "tah-dah" moment when you cast away the soggy outer layers.  And also you could be like, "You all thought my outfit was an understated six but - BOOM - this amazingly patterned dress makes it a blow away NINE! You'd better all get your sunglasses üí•"	episode_done:True

text:Fashion Resolutions and Goals: 2021 Edition	labels:I started buying \*almost\* exclusively secondhand this year. It was a fun way to shop since its relatively new to me. But since I bought a lot, I'm looking to make better creative use of what I purchased, rather than purchase more. The only thing that I continue to need since I'm slow in this area; shoes. I went on a flat/heel bender about a decade ago and figured out that I actually hate anything that makes my feet feel cold.. lol. So I've been investing one at a time in oxfords, sneakers, clogs - basically anything that I can wear socks with.  My goals are to:  * Continue to only purchase secondhand as I'm able (and as needs arise) * Keep an eye out for good shoes that are on my wishlist (currently eyeing some subtle floral printed sneakers, pink oxfords, and some birk clogs) * Get creative with storage in my small closet, not getting rid of much but re-organizing to give it some new creative life * Continue to experiment with color which is always a challenge for me - but I have a lot of fun colors now and I can mix and match more than I do currently * Knit 8 new garments for myself this year (Need to figure out exactly the colors I'd like before I start)

text:Eh I lived in Toronto for several years wearing maxi dresses and skirts and once I figured everything out it was fine. Under the skirt goes one layer of thermal leggings and then a petticoat that's very slightly longer than my skirt. The petticoat has a very full ruffle at the bottom. The multiple layers trap heat in effectively and are supremely warm without being super bulky. The ruffle at the bottom of my petticoat catches all the salt and muck as a sacrificial victim. Once it gets stained beyond saving, I take it off and sew a new ruffle on. My overskirt meanwhile never gets ruined.	labels:Omg a replaceable ruffle is mind blowing!

text:There is no unmarked woman	labels:I honestly have been normalized to being marked. Maybe I would actually feel unsettled if I was given "unlimited" freedom? Rompers, dresses, and skirts tend to be the clothes that I get the most feedback on. On one hand, I really do love compliments and conversations with others. In general, I love people.  But I've had awful experiences where being "marked" has had traumatic effects on my life. Maybe it would be different if I had more bad then good. Maybe my attitudes will change as I grow through life?  One of my supervisors made me laugh when he complimented my shirt saying "that's a museum person shirt". I think being marked can be good, when the intentions of a person are good.	episode_done:True

text:Winter staples?	labels:I've only lived in temperate climates from the time I can remember, but my winter strategy did get me through a few visits to Michigan around Christmas fairly decently as long as I wasn't spending extended periods of time outside. And I'm always cold in the winter.  I layer layer layer. I have a ton of heattech layers, in several different levels of warmth. I'll generally wear a cami, then a thinner base layer (those really thin shirts that are basically the cheapest tier), then a thicker layer (the second tier - I think they're called extra warm and they have more than one style), and occasionally an even thicker layer on top of that (the highest tier price wise and it's super thick). Then I'll wear a blouse and a sweater over that. For the bottom I wear fleece-lined tights, then thick shapewear for warmth, then fleece-lined leggings, paired with knee-high boots lined with something warm.   For outer layers I have three different warm coats -  one wool with a slimmer profile, one faux fur for fun, and a puffy one for when it's absolutely freezing and I don't care. I've got a pair of touchscreen gloves that are functional but not as warm as I'd like, and a pair of thick wool gloves that are amazing. And I'm trying to build up a collection of hats and scarves for walks because right now I just freeze, although at least wearing a face mask helps with that decently at the moment.	episode_done:True
text:What style rules or clothing attributes are you ruthless about?	labels:Outside of formal wear, I don't own clothes that aren't comfortable to sit around the house in. Even my jeans are soft and stretchy.   No skinny heels, no open toe heels, and no pumps/things that don't cover the top of my foot. My feet and ankles are much more comfortable in a thick oxford heel that laces up or booties than open shoes.  No grey. I went through a period of buying a lot of grey, with the thought process that those items would "go with everything", ignoring my colorful inner self entirely. Couldn't figure out why I was bored and hated getting dressed for a long time. Now, I've given up on "neutral" colors and accepted that I am a vibrant color person. Crimson red is neutral as far as I'm concerned, it goes with most other colors. So does cobalt, mustard yellow, on and on.  If I can't wear it with a regular bra or no bra, I'm not buying it. No strapless, or one strap, or oddly shaped bras for me.
text:Fellow color lover here! I feel so out of place on this sub some times for looking color. Until a few years ago, I didn't own a plain white or black t-shirt lol. I have since bought a few though because I have colored pants that look a bit better with a neutral colored top.

text:How do you dress for the (extreme) weather where you're from?	labels:I‚Äôm from up north and was adapted to cold but now will be kicking it long-term down south not too far off from Florida swamps. I‚Äôm just here hoping to pick up tips. Please, someone from a very humid and hot place, post your secrets. I‚Äôve lived in socal before and can handle dry heat but the humid heat sucks my soul out of my face pores. Thank goodness it‚Äôs starting to cool down. It‚Äôs my third summer here and still my most glimmering hope is for public nudity to become legal, widespread, and accepted in the region so I can let the hot humid breeze be my regalia.  The best advice I‚Äôve gotten from a native so far is from a man who said ‚Äúembrace the heat‚Äù and wears a hoodie and toboggan (what they call knit hats down here) in the summer. So I‚Äôve done that, I‚Äôve embraced the heat at least so I can not feel total despair when I have to wear pants in my workspace.  But if there are any other humid heat tips people have out there, I am a willing student. Magic fabrics? Sizing up so everything isn‚Äôt so hard to get out of? Would a swimsuit instead of a bra be advisable?
text:No bra is best, swimsuit and bralette are a close second. Oversized sports bra is a close third. Never wear a padded bra. I can't  imagine the mold that was grows in a Victoria's Secret Bombsbell bra.   Light layers helps. Instead of a hoodie, try a light colored, 100 cotton long sleeve button up.   I find backless shirts and dresses to be the coolest option without feeling too revealing to be around children. Linen or cotton short are usually less warm than denim.   Invest in quality sandals. You'll feel cooler, and you don't want to trash your feet with 25 cent flip flops (thongs). Spend the money, even if it feels silly.   Learn to like wide brimmed hats. Figure out a style you like, whether its straw cowboy hats or floppy sun hats. Keeping the sun off your cheeks helps.   Also, deodorant helps with chafing. Just throwing that out there.	labels:This but I would add, linen everything! Pants, shirts, anything you can get your hands on!	episode_done:True

text:Tips for feeling confident when wearing stylish clothes around family?	labels:I prefer not to wear super revealing clothes so as far as that goes I don‚Äôt have advice on how to wear it around family. But with the other stuff and just generally about clothes, I‚Äôd say just go for it. Been dealing with this a bit myself as the ‚Äúbaby‚Äù of the family they just have to get used to the fact that I‚Äôm in my early 20‚Äôs now and that can take some time. I started cleaning out my closet in 2017 after reading this book https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28364022 to purge all the teen clothes that no longer fit or I didn‚Äôt wear, and have been slowly adding more pieces in. I wore a fair amount of jeans and t shirts as a teenager and that‚Äôs still what I gravitate to, just in a more ‚Äúelevated‚Äù way, so that transition for me may be a bit more subtle on family members than it is for you.   I started wearing makeup this year and people started to notice and comment on it which makes me feel kind of self conscious but I think it‚Äôs mainly just that they‚Äôre not used to seeing it on me. They must be pretty observant too because i‚Äôm into very natural/ minimal makeup.   Eventually it will all become normal to them and they won‚Äôt notice it anymore or comment on it. Hopefully too you will begin to feel more comfortable in different, more adult styles and feel less like everyone is looking at you (I know I‚Äôve felt that way.)   Hope this could be helpful :)	episode_done:True

I'm not really impressed by flashy brands usually, but when I was a teen I got a pair of hand me down Gucci denim shorts, these to be specific([https://www.ebay.com/itm/Vintage-Bootleg-Gucci-Jean-Shorts-/164302034765](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Vintage-Bootleg-Gucci-Jean-Shorts-/164302034765)). I have never been more impressed with an article of clothing in my life, the craftsmanship and the quality were amaaazing. I swore as soon as I got real money I would be a Gucci fanboy for life. Well, now I'm a relatively successful working professional and while I still have that positive experience with the Gucci brand in my head, most of their current fashion trends are wayyyyy too eccentric for me. I've set aside money in the past to build a baseline wardrobe , preferably in the $1k range altogether although I would pay more if I fell in love. I live next to A huge outlet mall for all the name brands, but all the ones I've browsed through just seem like cheap fabric with an fancy logo and an expensive price tag.

text:Does the way you dress really have to have a label for it??	labels:Before I joined FFA, I never realized that there are people in the world who don't just...*see clothes they like and buy them*. Like, it's really not deeper than that.   Then I came here and apparently you need to have a name for your ~*aesthetic*~ with at least 4 adjectives "preppy witchy nonsensical space librarian" and I learned that some people seem to buy clothes they don't like because they're "trendy"? And they think that everyone who's "trendy" just buys the latest clothes because they're in fashion and not because they like them?   IDK, the FFA mentality and shopping habits are super confusing to me.
text:It seems tied to social media and branding. People are the product (so to speak) on social media much of the time and it seems that way of branding to identify and appeal to your customer/followers is bleeding into real life.   I definitely don‚Äôt have a problem with people who can describe their *~aesthetic~* but I feel bad for the ones who seem to feel pressure to figure it out. It‚Äôs just clothes!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Fashion "fantasies" coming true years later?	labels:Those are both amazing and have a similar vibe too. I used to dream of having an extensive vintage wardrobe, and now I own a vintage clothing store so I have all the wild shit I could ever dream of! Plus, I like to wear things I really like a couple times before washing (again) and listing them so I get to enjoy them without having to hold on to everything.
text:>now I own a vintage clothing store  You're literally living out your fantasy fashion life and that's amazing -- congratulations to you!	labels:Thank you! Right now I am pushing HARD to get through a huge pile of stuff that's been sitting because... seasonal depression. Also I'm pregnant so I can't wear any of it right now, but it's motivating me to get it listed so I can buy cute things for my kids	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 02, 2020	labels:Any recommendations for an overcoat? Budget \~$300, to wear over a gray or blue suit.  Wool would be great.  My husband's style involves cardigans, sweater polos, and chest hair, but definitely would prefer classic and timeless over trendy.  Edit: I'm in the US, and also, what color do you think is most versatile?  Probably aiming at networking and job interviews
text:Suitsupply has more formal ones made to layer over suits, and they‚Äôre in that range. Colour wise go for navy or charcoal.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:There is no unmarked woman	labels:Straight cis men are the *only* ones unmarked because they are the default. Everyone else (straight women, gay women or men, non-binary individuals, trans individuals, etc.) is an *other*, we're a deviation from the norm.   We stand out by sheer relationship with the default, because cis men *always* have opinions and comments and judgments about you as a person that dares to exist, let alone about your appearance. And all that judgement comes from misogyny.   You stand out as a straight woman because they want to fuck you, or not. As a lesbian because they want to fuck you, but can't. As a gay man because they're afraid you view straight men the way they view all women.   All judgement on appearance is an extension of this inherent judgement of character and existence, in general. They're not judging your style choices, they're judging what your choices say about how you feel about them - or how they feel about you.
text:Yeaaaaaaaaa, as a trans woman this is something I‚Äôm struggling with. I used to be able to wear jeans and a dress shirt everyday and blend in. Now everything is a choice and I have no idea how to make up my mind!  This shit takes up a lot of mental space and frankly I just want to blend into the background.	labels:As another trans woman, I love that I now have so many choices rather than the "uniform" for men that I felt like I was forced to wear.  The main thing that now stops me from buying up entire stores is that I'm picky about fabrics (avoiding pure polyester) and pockets.	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 07, 2021	labels:Need some denim advice. I am looking to try some new denim but don‚Äôt want to go into the raw denim route. I currently wear Everlane Skinny and they are a little stiff for me. Also, I don‚Äôt love the higher rise. I used to wear Jcrew but the jeans became garbage a bit ago. I‚Äôm looking for a skinny (not ultra skinny) jean with a little stretch that doesn‚Äôt make me look like I‚Äôm 15 years old, and isn‚Äôt super stiff, and is better quality than basic JCrew/Fast Fashion pant. Any ideas? You guys haven‚Äôt led me astray with the Wax London and Velva Sheen recommendations
text:Nudie jeans, acne denim, rrl denim are some higher end non raw denim options	labels:Thanks! I love the RRL sweaters, but I‚Äôm guessing the price of jeans is similar (and out of my range). I‚Äôll take a look at nudies and acne	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 18, 2020	labels:Is there info on a pair of Polo khakis that would allow me to order the EXACT same pair? I have a pair that are the best fitting and looking of anything I've ever owned. Unfortunately they're beginning to be too short and a hole in the crotch. üòï. I've purchased others with the same 'classic fit' tag, but they don't wear the same.
text:I don't really understand what you're asking, can you elaborate I feel like i'm missing an important piece of context.	labels:I have a pair of Polo khakis that fit and look amazing. I've tried to buy the same style and size but none fit the same. I'm wondering if there is any tag info I can retrieve from this pair to order the exact same pair.	episode_done:True
text:How do I improve my fashion sense beyond just tshirt and jeans?	labels:I don't think anyone's mentioned this already (sorry if I'm wrong and missed it), but I had a friend once suggest to find celebrities or influencers whose style you like and then just kind of try and emulate that until you start to feel confident enough in it to start doing your own thing. Also the Pinterest suggestion that others have already said is a great one too.
text:I second this, and an additional benefit is knowing the celeb's height and body type, so you get style plus fit and proportions.    I took a blog's style quiz once, which had a neat feature that showed not only the bloggers outfits, but also a selection of celebrities that also wear that look.  OP might like it because it focused on small details to start, so she won't get overwhelmed with everything out there all at once.    u/underthebits294 if you are starting out from a jeans and t-shirt place, you might naturally have a sporty style to you.  I like the suggestions on this page to make it classic - that way you can feel fancier in public, not compromise your style, and not have to buy a whole new wardrobe right away    https://stunningstyle.com/style-secrets/how-to-dress-sporty-classic-outfits	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What rules do you break for your body type?	labels:I'm short, and one of the fashion guidelines I tend to read say to create long lines - this means avoiding ankle straps on shoes. I LOVE ankle straps on everything - heels, flats, sandals, etc. I definitely ignore this rule! Another rule I saw was to avoid the midi length since it can sometimes be too long but not long enough to be maxi. I wear my midi length skirts high-waisted so they fall at the right point and I love them. IDC if they make me look short, they're gorgeous!
text:Where do you find appropriate length midi skirts as a short person? I‚Äôm always swimming in them üò´	labels:If you can find a style you like from them, Gap and Old Navy sell almost all of their clothing in petite versions.	episode_done:True

text:What are your favorite, trusted clothing lines for buying wear-forever investment classics?	labels:For basics: in my experience Lands End has consistently good quality for the price point, especially considering their constant 40% off sales.   I have several Eileen Fisher items secondhand and they're all fabulous, well made, durable. I dont have a lot of experience with items purchased new in that price range to compare to.  When the apocalypse comes and nothing is left of me, my cheerful cherry red Patagonia pants will still be cheerful cherry red and perfectly intact around my charred outline.  Have also been generally happy with Boden and Talbots.  My one pair of Everlane dress pants has held up very nicely for a few years.  For knits, I'm still on the lookout.  I have a 10 year old American Apparel t shirt I've worn heavily that is slight faded but not a single pill and the neckline is as flat as the day it was born.  However I can't support LA Apparel anymore and more recent American Apparel is not like that anymore.  I have a few knits from secondhand Lilla P which is pricier new but they have also held up very well.    I haven't found my new white whale for knits yet.  May try American Giant, Kotn, or Fair Indigo next.  I have knits from Pact more recently which are middling and I like that they are organic and affordable, I think they accomplish that with material that tends to be thinner.    Shoe shout outs: Trotters, Chacos   Bra shout out: Natori
text:Second Eileen Fisher.  I've had certain core pieces for years, worth every dime.  A few years ago I saw them trend toward "ultrafine" and suchlike that were fragile and certainly not worth EF prices, so to be avoided.  I see less of that in their lines lately though not gone altogether.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:General Discussion - December 21, 2020	labels:I really like to wear black captoe Oxford for casual wear. I am aware it breaks the rules, but is it so odd that it's off the charts?  My jeans are black or gray, the right size, in slim, tapered fit. Just slightly longer than my legs, so I can cuff them once, or show little, not excessive breaks.  I wear Oxford shirts, or long sleeved plain t-shirts. All colors black, gray, or navy blue. I have one flannel checkered shirt. In autumn I might layer up.   Given my very conservative colors, is my style palatable by any stretch of the word?   Here's an example : https://m.imgur.com/s8gCTem
text:Better suited to simple questions  Also i think black derbies would look much better	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Transition Lenses/Glasses	labels:Like others have mentioned, it‚Äôs entirely how you feel about your look and ultimately your decision when it comes down to it. However my advice would be against it, I find that while they try to be the best of both worlds with glasses and sunglasses they just end up being a worse version of either. Either they‚Äôre bad sunglasses because the glasses part is small, or they‚Äôre weird looking glasses because it‚Äôs a big sunglasses frame. As well I personally find the awkward grey tinge they have in the ‚Äúmid‚Äù light conditions to be very tacky/dorky looking. Like many others have said, with the price of cheap frames now a days you can just get a cheaper pair of both. Prescription sunglasses or contacts for days you need sunglasses is likely the better option for you.
text:Yeah after all the advice I got here and your to top it off, I think you are on point  This is why, my store has two sizes 51 and 53, 53 looks big on me, I need 51 as I wear 52 usually anyways  but if I go with transition, the guy told me I should get 53, as the transition on 51 would make it look smaller  &#x200B;  so yeah, you are on point here, it will look either bad as sunglasses cuz it's small or bad as eyeglasses cuz it's big  &#x200B;  I ended up choosing 51 eyeglasses, and then I will just get prescription sunglasses on the side by changing one of the old lenses on my frame - I think that's the best way to go on about this, transitional glasses are like tablets - neither a phone nor a laptop  &#x200B;  Thanks for the advice, I might make a new post later black plastic frames what sunglass lens colour to get	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 14, 2020	labels:**Where do slim and tall people find trousers?**  I am very fond of the Ralph Lauren look, which is a struggle, since finding trousers or chinos tall enough for me is almost impossible. I am not extremely tall but tall enough to make it a struggle. I usually have W30/32 and L36 in jeans, I do find jeans that fit me, but only when putting a lot of work into it. L34 might work when there is saved fabric for lengthening the trousers.  So where do you guys find trousers and chinos that have the same measurements as me? (Sites must deliver to Europe)  Also, if any of you that share my measurements can order trousers from Ralph Lauren, please do tell me!  Thanks in advance!
text:Budget?	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What‚Äôs a fashion rule you defy (dressing for your shape, weird color combos, interesting silhouettes etc) that you just love?	labels:I don‚Äôt do the ‚Äútake one thing off‚Äù rule. I put that stuff on for a reason.  I also don‚Äôt follow the color season thing, because it‚Äôs like being limited to one section of a box of crayons, and I don‚Äôt even like autumn colors. Or the body type advice, which for me means being put in a *very uncomfortable* box.

text:Revisiting Tim Gunn's List of 10 Style Must-haves	labels:If you live in a hot climate where it rarely rains, I can tell you that you don't need a trench coat.
text:IMO not much use for them in the midwest, either. I think the midwestern equivalent would be a stylish winter coat like a wool peacoat for people that need a more formal work wardrobe. Light jacket season, which is where I'd think the trench coat falls, is very short here in reality.	labels:It probably depends where in the Midwest you live, too. The weather in Wisconsin isn‚Äôt the same as in Ohio.  I live in Indiana and I definitely use a trench in Spring when it‚Äôs chilly and wet.	episode_done:True
text:How do you know when something doesn't fit perfectly?	labels:The most basic thing, fundamental, objective thing is if it uncomfortable or impedes your movements. Some of this you only figure out when you wear things particularly if they are too loose (too tight you usually notice faster), like tops or dresses too big their neckline might move a bit and look askew, or you step on the hem of skirts or dresses at you climb stairs. Skirts too tight might ride up, pants too tight might dig and create camel toe or the zipper give way and open...  For other things, say pant or skirt length it might be a matter of aesthetics, 5 or 10 cm lower or higher..  Probably the most important point for things to fit is the shoulders and armpits, so it does not impede movement and because outerwear, tops, etc, hangs literally from there. If fitted, the seam should be at the edge of your shoulder blade naturally.  Not everything can be altered to fit right. There might not be enough fabric for that, or it might just a design which was cut for different proportions than yours. Tailoring can do subtle tweaks, on woven fabrics (knits are harder, way harder), but the first and most important step of getting clothes which fit well is REJECTING things, lots of things, most things, almost all things. Trying many many things, being analytical so you can learn stuff (if it looks like that chances are it will loook  this other thing on my body, Brand X pants always fit me right and Brand Y pants never).
text:A note on knits--if it's 100% wool and it isn't washable, you can actually sew it up and cut (similar to a method called steeking, which is used to create sleeves in faire isle sweaters), fold the inner seams over and sew. The wool will felt to itself after a handwashing or two and the sewing keeps it together well because of the pull the woll fibers have on one another. It can be scary to try, but with practice it can really change how a sweater fits and is great. I've done it on sweaters I've handknit myself in particular, but wanted to mention it here in case anyone is thinking about wool items going into the colder months!	labels:	episode_done:True

Fair warning, they are not very stylish. But they are miraculous. They are also excellent for days running through airports catching planes, which I also used to do a lot. Never thought I would miss that.

text:Dressing larger bodies - without looking sloppy	labels:I think what's consistent in the examples that you've shown is that she has a very minimalist style in darker colors. The quality of the fabric appears to be high. When you use natural fibers like cotton and wool and silk they will naturally drape better on any body type. Look for pieces like cocoon jackets, cropped wide leg trousers, and tunics for example.

text:I wouldn't wear the Harbor Blue one to a job interview.  Although, as a blond white guy, the Harbor Blue one would look objectively better on me.  Two things:  1. If it's your only suit, go Caspian Sea. It's basically navy, and that's the only kinda blue that's acceptable for job interviews. If you already have a suit for that, go Harbor.  2. Is your skin-hair color high contrast or low contrast? If high, Caspian. If low, Harbor.	labels:Good advice! Thanks	episode_done:True

They're so so soft and so so comfy and I don't care if I look like a member of the Weasley family, I feel much more put together wearing them than just wear a ratty old t-shirt and boxers.

I think it's a combination of poor quality and again shoving my arm into the jacket (I'm right handed lol).

I've been through a handful of autumns and winters out here.  My standard for rain, though, is Florida, where you have a torrential downpour every day at 3 PM in the summer.	episode_done:True
text:The inspiration of vintage leisure and sportswear	labels:I personally really love seeing and using trousers (high-waisted/rise, usually wool fabric, side slash pockets) in more casual fits.  People usually think of trousers as being just worsted wool, or the cloth that traditional business suits are in, and those aren't the ones to use outside the context of a suit. But trousers with some texture to them like woollen flannel, linen, or even cotton can really create some great silhouettes with wider fits and higher waists if tucked in. One of my favourite moves recently is the tee tucked into a pair of trousers ‚Äì¬†/u/fishbawiz illustrated this well with [his recent WAYWT post](https://imgur.com/a/ly3G5Mb)

text:Throwback Thursday: Revisiting our 'Finding A Style and Building A Wardrobe' guide	labels:I know it's supposed to be a general guide and COVID won't be around forever, but maybe a note about services that let you try on clothes at home before you buy would be good. That's also a good idea for people who don't live near a mall or have a variety of stores to visit in person.
text:Do you have any services you'd recommend?	labels:Like the other person said prime wardrobe is one that comes to mind. There are a few subscription boxes too like Stitch Fix, Nordstrom trunk club, and Thredup goody boxes, though you can't just pick what you want in those	episode_done:True

text:I would try keeping an eye on [Lace Market](https://egl.circlly.com/) which is a great 2nd hand website for lolita clothing! There's no listing for the bangle right now, but I think there's a lot of new listings being uploaded daily, so I would just check every now and then:)	labels:Thank you for the recommendation! I haven't worn Lolita since it was all lace headdresses and controversy over the Hot Topic BTSSB knockoff, but I still covet this piece intensely.	episode_done:True
text:Brands that are actually great that you discovered on Instagram?	labels:Lo & Sons bags: I have a backpack(Hanover 2), weekender tote (Catalina Deluxe Tote), purse (the Pearl in saffino leather), and wallet. Love them all. Good construction, attractive design, and functional interiors. They have good sales pretty often too.   I wanted another Pearl in the softer leather (safino is built to water and stain resistant), but I literally only wear one bag full time for years until it gives out. I have several other purses in a box under my bed but they get used once a year, if that.
text:I‚Äôve had my soft leather Pearl for 4+ years now and used it almost exclusively before switching to machine-washable bags during covid. It still looks fantastic despite the more delicate finish and doesn‚Äôt feel dated at all to me. The key leash was a revelation and set the bar for all future purses.

Granted, I have a LOT of shoes (I know, it‚Äôs an addiction) but I reach for these 70-80% of the time. They don‚Äôt sell them anymore, but the style/shape with the very low heel satisfies my love for heels while being extremely comfortable (which is particularly important for me, as a woman with MS who uses a cane to walk).	episode_done:True

text:Chelsea boots under ‚Ç¨200	labels:One thing about leather is that if you go too inexpensive, i.e. below the line of a Thursdays or Meermin, you wind up with inferior leather and poor welts that mean you'll only get a season or two out of them... and you're probably begin to see defects in the leather well before that.
text:Doesn‚Äôt Meermin use brand name leather from reputable tanneries?  Their website certainly claims that they do. Most pair of shoes come with a mention of the tannery where leather is sourced.  I might have missed something, I‚Äôm not an expert.	labels:Meermin is fine, and I own several pairs of their shoes and boots. As another poster said, their quality control is not perfect and their customer service is less than stellar. Also their boots have quite the break-in period.  What I meant to say is that price-wise, Meermin and Thursdays represent the absolute bottom of the price range in terms of acceptable quality for leather footwear. Below that, you are going to get bad cuts of leather and questionable craftsmanship that will begin to look bad quickly and fall apart after a season or two.  Leather is an amazing substance and will last a lifetime of beatings if you get the proper pair. But it is not cheap and these two brands represent the minimum you need to pay (for new stuff) to make your purchase worth it.	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - January 07, 2021	labels:I'm in a ambivalent state of mind right now. For a like over a year now I have been into streetwear. Baggy, oversized clothes with lots of prints and branding. This was my first period of taking clothing serious and feeling "fashionable". But one can only see so many of the "same" outfits.  I grew really tired of streetwear in the last couple of weeks but I'm scared to leave my comfort zone. I'm 20 years old but feel like dressing like a teenager. I really really like graphic tees if the prints are well done and If I would imagine dressing like lets say Tim Dessaint for example, who is not into graphics/"crazyness" at all, It would feel too "mature" for my age if that makes sense.  But at the very same time, I feel like im dressing too childish when wearing cargo pants + graphic tee.  Am I overthinking this?
text:Yeah, you're overthinking it.  It's mostly in your head and once you make the shift you'll find yourself slowly becoming comfortable and wondering what the problem was. Tim has plenty of fits that still veer young, and you can always inject some of them with a streetwear sensibility (Streetwear is a broad term nowadays).	labels:	episode_done:True

text:No Cop January - End of the Month Check In	labels:I didn't commit myself to this, but in a hobby that can be so consumption-oriented I think it's wise to take pause and consider if that aspect is working well or is a compulsion.  This month I spent about $15 at thrift stores and came away with a few items. Two of them will hold similar slots in my wardrobe to a couple of other things which I'll therefore sell or donate after a bit more wear.  In fact, I'm sort of kicking myself for not also getting a weird, funky sweater that I found. I'm set for sweaters, but it was an interesting piece.  I've got a full closet, but this rate of consumption isn't a big red flag to me. I do have trouble letting go of older, but still functional items. There have been times in my life when I've had a much smaller wardrobe out of necessity; I enjoyed the simplicity of that, but I also enjoy that I have a range of better and bolder clothing now. Finding the balance for me means getting ever stricter about purchases, but perhaps should also mean purging more aggressively over time.	episode_done:True

text:What are some differences between stereotypical Millennial and Gen Z fashion/aesthetics?	labels:I'm borderline X/millennial.   I see Gen Z wearing styles that I remember from middle school.  Things like baggier jeans, the high waisted trend (my early 20s was defined by low waisted pants), oversized clothing (think Billie Eilish), etc.  I see some of these styles and think "this should have stayed in the 90s".  The example I think about is Mom jeans.  Many millennials still remember the SNL skit where they made fun of them and how unflattering they are.  They made them look matronly and dowdy.  I can't bring myself to even go near them in the store without that SNL skit playing in my head.

The cohesiveness has been more or less by accident, by the way, I‚Äôve just found myself gravitating towards a very specific color palette, and so although not everything I own is the same style, the colors all go, and that makes it look cohesive. I think my style was a lot more boring and less cohesive back when I was wearing random graphic tees and hoodies with colorful skinny jeans and converse back in the mid-2010s because it was the same outfit every day, just in a bunch of random colors I gave no thought to and just like every other kid in my school was wearing.

text:How much was your most expensive fashion item and when or how often do you wear it?	labels:I recommend investing in items that will get heavy use for your local weather. My two most expensive items are coats: Canada Goose Kensington down coat ($700) and Burberry Westminster trench ($1000 from an outlet). I‚Äôve worn my Canada Goose coat most days for each of the past 6 winters, and it keeps me toasty unlike any other coat I‚Äôve owned. I don‚Äôt get to wear my Burberry trench often because the weather here seems to skip straight between summer and winter.  I use the Stylebook wardrobe app to track of the ‚Äúcost per wear‚Äù of items. This has been really helpful! I‚Äôve stopped buying expensive bags when I realized I basically only use my favorite three.  Most of the designer items I own were bought second-hand from eBay or Poshmark. This takes some practice, but you can find really nice gently worn items at a steep discount. Also don‚Äôt forget that designer label or a high price tag does not guarantee high quality. Likewise some high quality stuff is inexpensive, e.g., I really like Uniqlo basics.	episode_done:True

text:Serious Answer: Fashion is art made from textiles. Most artists have a specific vision for their works display. Like galleries are for tangible art for purchase and display, fashion shows are the same. They are where fashion buyers, press, celebrities, and marketers attend a show to place orders and review the artist's work. The catwalk is designed to show the movement of the fabric, it also showcases the scenery and styling the artist envisioned for their collection. Fashion without fashion shows would devoid the artist of their full vision and the buyers a chance to sample the collection, project demand for trends, seasonal color pallets, etc before stockists could get their hands on it. Without fashion shows, buyers would lose a lot of money for ill forecasts of demand, and clothing would cost more to mitigate those risks.      TLDR: Fashion shows are necessary because its the artists vision realized, and a buyers dream.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Coming to this realization after entering the designer world has been really frustrating for me. Once you know it you can never unsee or unlearn it and it entirely changes my satisfaction with fashion but especially frustration with handbags.  I enjoy designer but don‚Äôt look at all items as needing or wanting them to be ‚Äúinvestment pieces‚Äù.   I love some of my designer bags, but my #1 bag that I looked forward to for many years and was ecstatic for now sits wrapped and in its boxed not even in in my main closet but in the closet storage for seasonal items. I‚Äôve used it about 3 or 4 times.  But now that I learned so much about bags, you can‚Äôt unsee that the vast majority of bags available are all just blatant but cheap nods to the highest end designer bags. It is insanely hard to find a well made, minimalist bag now that isn‚Äôt desperately trying to look like Herm√®s or Chanel. I don‚Äôt understand it, why does anyone want a medium range bag - that is trying to look like the more expensive version?  Entering wealthier social circles becomes exhausting and hunting down a new bag when you need it involves so much research to find a quality, beautiful bag and verifying it isn‚Äôt heavily copying designer elements really makes it less joyful.

Vintage raw cotton batting! I see thread scraps in here too used as filling.) To use for.... Something? Back patch for jacket? A pair of quilt pants? Heavy picnic blanket?  A lot of people are telling me to preserve it. Patch and fill the holes with my visible mending skills and keep it as a quilt for living with. It just seems so fragile, though?

Depending on your personal style, you can try a patterned, or colorful top paired with a dark coloured/neutral bottom, or vice versa. Or try monochromatic pairing, or some kind of color theme to the separates.

text:General Discussion - January 15, 2021	labels:I'm very stressed.   My apartment lease is up in mid April, and I do not want to renew. There has been a string of car and apartment break ins over the past few months (my car being the first one to kick start it), and the complex refuses to install security camera or fix the doors.  Additionally unless I sign up for a 16 month lease (two more months than the one I have right now), my rent would get kicked up $200 a month.   I decided to buy a house. I make a decent amount and have a good amount money to put down. I did not realize that it takes about a month to get everything ready for a loan, and in turn, to make an offer on a house. The houses in the area I'm looking in are going fast, and at this rate, it is looking like I'd have to build a home (which I am ok with), however a new house would be ready by at least fall of this year. I do not want to do this, because if I do, I would have get a temp lease for that time, and any place (around me) I get a temp lease at, I would be losing money since the rate is so high. It would be wiser for me to move another place, save up more money for a year, and kick off the home buying process a bit sooner.  So right now my plan is, wait until I get preapproved for a loan (which should be around the end of January/start of Feb), look for a house until the last day of February, then if I haven't found a house I like, I start looking for a cheeper safer apartment, if I found a house I like, I make an offer. It's a short time frame to make such a huge important decision. I have already put a lot of time and effort into this already, so for me I have to see this through to the end, but I am afraid that this is all for nothing.
text:[deleted]	labels:I got prequalified in a matter of hours, but the bank I am working with said it'd take a few days in order to get preapproved. None of the realtors can do anything with the prequalification, they need a preapproval. They submitted everything Tuesday, and I'm going to follow up this coming up Tuesday to see where we are at and what the hold up is. Appreciate the heads up regarding the preapprovals. The realtor I am working with assures me that we can make an offer, and then have me move into a house in less than 30 days, max 45 days. If I am able to make an offer at the end of February, then we should be good for a minute. He and his company have no lower of a 4.8 star rating on both Yelp and Google, so I'll trust him when he says it's possible.  I agree I shouldn't make a decision under duress, however when I told my parents that I was going to buy a house, they have been giving money to put towards a down payment. I keep on telling them to stop, and wait until I make an offer, but they do not stop. I've even offered to give it back, but they refuse. They've given me $25k so far. With their money and support, I feel kind of guilted into buying a house, because if I don't, I would have that $25k+ in my bank account just sitting there. Yes it's gaining interest, and they would not of given me that money if they didn't feel comfortable giving it away, it still awkward for me. What happens if a year goes by, and I just decide to move to another apartment? What happens if that happens again? And again? And again? And I never buy a house? It just a really uncomfortable feeling.	episode_done:True

Unique sample piece I picked up them at the Viberg sample sale in 2017 for a crazy steal; I did a small write-up on them that I‚Äôll link to. Detail shots to come.  Edit: [Details album](https://imgur.com/a/xfBDO86); You can see how the 2030 last has this [unstructured toebox](https://i.imgur.com/xFkTcZl.jpg)  that gives it this sleek profile which I love.

And the best part was the price: $200. Snapped these up instantly.  >I will admit that the heel cup feels really stiff, especially at the back of the heel, but I'm hoping it'll soften up and maybe stretch out like the Viberg guys said they would.  I later realized what the Viberg guys were talking about; they used spare Tan Teton roughout and made up the boot as a Bobcat model (note the extended heel counter; the classic [Boondocker heel counter](https://images.app.goo.gl/NncziC8z4XbX9ajj6) is shorter), but on the 2030 last. From my internet digging and guessing, I think this might have been a sample they made up for the 2017 Division Road release that they did.  Can confirm they were hell to break in, probably because I went a half size too small. It hurt to even walk up or down stairs with thick boot socks, but my college ass wasn't gonna complain about $200 piece unique Vibergs.
text:How does everything you have fit you so well?! Whether it's tailoring, SLP, milsurp, sprezz, all of it looks so natural on you!	labels:This is extremely high praise, thank you!!! Tbh military is one of the least familiar areas to me, which is why it doesn‚Äôt come out much at all.   I guess a big reason why things look natural is because it all fits my personality? I don‚Äôt do many loud patterns or bold saturated colours because that‚Äôs just not who I am as a person (/u/pumaturtle can vouch for me here). There are definitely times where I push my boundaries, but there‚Äôs always at least some element of familiarity and justification of decisions that I‚Äôve made that gives me the confidence to wear a particular fit. Hope that makes sense!	episode_done:True
text:All-time favorite cold weather pieces?	labels:I work in a ski valley town, so I've learned a thing or two about cold weather fashion! Honestly, I don't have specific pieces to suggest. It's all about function for me and then I cover all that functional warm stuff with my regular jeans and sweaters. Here are my tips:  -Long Underwear. I usually just get mine from Walmart, and they have lasted years. I get fleece/synthetic instead of cotton, because if you sweat and it gets moist, it's very cold. Much colder than wearing fleece.   -Always wear a hat! If you're cold and not wearing a beanie, what are you doing? Seriously it makes a huge difference, and hats are cute.   -Wear gloves/mittens too! Mittens are usually warmer.   -Scarf! A thick scarf or a buff will do wonders. Basically, cover every part of your skin that you can. Turtle neck sweaters are great too.   -Tuck in your shirt. Do this with your long underwear set too. It keeps your core warm.  -Wool socks. IMO Darn Tough makes the best socks for cold weather hiking and I even wear them snowboarding. Same as the fleece/synthetic fibers, if they get wet it's much more bearable and warm than cotton. A lot of wool socks are super thick, but Darn Tough socks aren't too crazy. They expensive though.   -Winter shoes/boots. You can't depend on your  cute fall booties to keep your feet warm. If it gets super cold where you are and especially if there is snow, I'd go ahead and get a pair of boots/shoes made for cold conditions. Even in these shoes though, the socks you wear will make a difference.   -Layering. On a typical day working at the ski valley, I'll wear my long underwear set, a sweater, a zip up sweater/thick cardigan and a coat. Or two. I also shop second hand most of the time, so I could probably wear a lot fewer layers if I bought a proper winter puffie coat, but I also like my layers so I can adjust all day. I typically lose a couple layers by mid day and put them back on as the sun goes down.   That's all I got! Sorry this was so long, and my grammar is crap. :D  It may feel like a lot of junk to carry around but it's so worth it when you're warm and cozy and not miserable. Plus, just be a crazy big bag lady like me, and you'll have plenty of room for all your stuff.  Hope you stay warm this winter! I think with the proper gear you can enjoy this beautiful season.	episode_done:True

The example I think about is Mom jeans.  Many millennials still remember the SNL skit where they made fun of them and how unflattering they are.  They made them look matronly and dowdy.  I can't bring myself to even go near them in the store without that SNL skit playing in my head.

text:How did you curate/purge your wardrobe specifically for moving? What pieces did you bring when moving to a drastically different climate? What other fashion moving tips do people have?	labels:I‚Äôve moved between New York, London, Los Angeles, Bangkok and Nairobi. A couple of things I have learned over the years (and looks contrary to some advice you‚Äôve been given, so really to each their own).   1. I bring a limited amount of stuff with me. Just my favorites really. It helps to cull my wardrobe and don‚Äôt underestimate how much shopping you‚Äôll want to do in a new place. There will be new stores, a new vibe, and you‚Äôll want to fit in to the new place you‚Äôre living. Really, do you want a lot of stuff you can‚Äôt wear taking up precious closet space?   1a. Since it sounds like a domestic move another question might be whether or not to put this in storage. Is this a long-term move or do you see it as temporary? That might help make decisions on what to leave behind easier.   2. You can pack some of those sweaters! Did I think I would want to wear jeans in Bangkok or Nairobi? Nope, but I ended up anyways because my body adjusted to the climate. That being said, if there‚Äôs a cultural element, listen to folks who have been there (ie shorts are inappropriate a lot of places in the world for women).   3. In warmer climates I tend to add a lot more jewelry. Clothes seem to be a lot less important when you‚Äôre wearing less of them.   It might also help to say where exactly you were moving. You mention Southwest USA but a Los Angeles weather versus an Arizona weather will be a lot different.
text:Southwest USA probably is the wrong description, since I‚Äôm moving to the Bay Area, but the prospect of non freezing winters without much rain makes me feel like the entire year is summer üòÇ	labels:Maybe I‚Äôm biased because I‚Äôm a socal person, but I wouldn‚Äôt call SF a place without much rain.

Wings + Horns or Reigning Champ tiger fleece hoodie. Indestructible material, texture looks great. Nothing fancy, but looks great on it's own with just jeans.   Uniqlo jeans. Amazing quality for its price. I've now own two of the same black jeans and I wear them almost everyday   Uniqlo basic tees. After W+H these are what I wear. Super simple but lasts long for its price and fits great. Soft material.   Engineered Garments wool cinch vest. Very flexible. Can be worn over a long sleeve tee, sweater or even a hoodie.

text:Does the way you dress really have to have a label for it??	labels:Tbh, I feel like I see a version of this question every couple of weeks on this forum.  The short answer is no. There is no reason that you have to find one specific style you like and stick with it, or pick a style and only buy things in that style, just so that you can attach a name to it.   However! the nature of this forum is such that you have people who are spending a lot of time thinking about clothes, their clothing choices, looking for ways to refine their style, and curate their wardrobes, so being able to draw enough similarities in order to verbally convey that style is a pretty natural byproduct.  Depending on how you interact with clothing, it sometimes legitimately doesn't make sense to try and attach a label.  It's also pretty common to go through phases of the way you buy things. I definitely did the "anything that looks cute thing on me" at one point, which eventually meant my tastes widened so much that there wasn't a lot of consistency, and making an outfit eventually felt more like a chore than something enjoyable.  Figuring out what I loved, that also worked with my life circumstances made sense for me, and did eventually lead me to a place where I have a style can be easily labeled.   Bottom line is that your style needs to be something that works *for* you, which for some people means distilling it down to something that can be easily identified or labeled, and if that's not the way that you want to interact with fashion, that's perfectly valid.	episode_done:True

I prefer that 70s and 60s styles over 90s and 2000s. 90s and early 2000s has been dominating younger adults and teens for the past years already though. Colorful pastel mix matchy stuff, velvet and featured trim tops and dresses. Chunky sandals and heels. I do like it but as I approach 30 I don't think I can pull that off. I just ordered an outfit from The Hippie Shake, UK website, and they are amazing 70s inspired stuff! I hope this trend takes off more.	episode_done:True

text:Skirts and dresses in winter - how to look good and be warm with a combo of boots, socks, tights?	labels:So, imo, knees high boots with a dress and sweater looks adorable, is very feminine, and is also fairly warm.

I probably wouldn't wear ankle boots with a dress/skirt without tights, but I guess it would depend on how long the dress/skirt is. If I had to choose an ankle boot, I'd go for something like [this](https://pin.it/5XBXphK), so I could at least wear thick socks. I also think it really depends on your body type. I can't wear a Chelsea boot because they make my legs look huge, but cowboy style ankle boots are fine.

One of my exes is the son of a jeweler and I got some extremely nice pieces in the 5 years we were together.

Everything else is still in rotation.

text:Is fast fashion really fast fashion if you get years of use out of the garments?	labels:I think this is a misunderstanding of fast fashion. Fast fashion refers to the systematic trends wherein large companies have rapid turnover of their clothing collections, shifting their inventory and putting out lots of new clothes as new trends rapidly emerge. On an individual level, you may not be buying every new trend, but you‚Äôre still buying within the system of ‚Äòfast fashion‚Äô. (That isn‚Äôt a criticism, just a statement of fact). The issue is more a systematic one than one on an individual consumer level, though contributing to circular economies does help to an extent. If companies like Aritzia are putting out lots of new collections, they‚Äôre still participating in fast fashion regardless of how much ethical marketing they put out or how expensive their clothing is.	episode_done:True
text:Article: Why Is Fashion So Beige This Season?	labels:I know this is controversial, but I honestly miss the early 2000s trends. Of course I‚Äôd never dress like that now, but there was something so happy and innocent about a time when everything was bedazzled and bright.

text:Why Ralph Lauren Never Goes Out of Style	labels:Ralph Lauren never goes out of style, but it also goes out of style all the time.  It's a massive brand with many sub-brands, some of which are absolutely terrible. Each year, about half the Polo collection is bad.  Yeah, with the amount of pieces they dish out, they're doing things right and a lot of it stays alive and keeps working decades down the road. There are also MANY regrettable items.  (BTW I'm wearing 2 RRL items right now. I don't hate on the brand, I just think flattering comments regarding the staying power are to be put in perspective)
text:The abundance of sub-brands is really confusing and annoying. There's the shitty Kohl's tier Chaps and Lauren Ralph Lauren brands all the way up to Purple Label and RRL, and what seems like another dozen or two in-between. I don't understand why it was thought to be a good idea to create so many damn lines.  Shit, there's literally three sub-brands with the word polo in the title. Which then creates a situation where a garbage brand like U.S. Polo Assn can leech off your sales by making people assume they're another RL sub-brand and result in you having to spend untold amounts of money suing them over it.	labels:It allows them to sell someone who went looking for a $250 suit a $300 one, without turning off the people who are ready to spend a grand on a 'real' one.	episode_done:True

If you catch yourself feeling bad during the month, remind yourself it‚Äôs an experiment and just a month.  At the end of 30 days you can decide if you liked it better or not.   Commit for long enough to see how you actually feel, but not so long that you have to feel like you‚Äôre making a major decision.
text:This is a very good idea actually, it will absolutely give me some air and calm to opt out for a period of time, and just make due with what I have and focus on other things. Perhaps this period of time could also give my some clarity over what I actually could use and like, and not just what I feel like I "have" to buy based on stress.

text:Why I‚Äôve tracked every single piece of clothing I‚Äôve worn for three years	labels:i honestly tried something similar like this.. keeping track of how often I wore what.. as a way to see where I should spend less and more on.  in the end it never worked as I guess, I psychologically pushed myself to wear things more equally when I looked at my charts.  I'd see something on my chart that I didnt wear so much, and start wearing it to 'balance' it out.
text:Author here. I think this is a really interesting point. I hadn't though of it, but I ended up taking this "outside observer" perspective. I try divest whatever I divest as sustainably as possible. Some things I sell through second hand channels, some I donate to be sold or to charity, some I keep using as sportswear or garden work clothes, or rugs, and some I put in fabric recycling that fashion stores are mandated to offer. This, what I believe to be a good way to divest, has helped me get rid of clothes I don't wear rather than trying to increase their use.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How does a warm weather wardrobe differ from a cold weather wardrobe?	labels:New Orleans is super humid all summer.

I have pictures of me at Mardi Gras (in February) in short sleeves and jeans, perfectly comfortable.   Light cardigans for going inside are a great idea for southern summers. They have to blast the AC just to control the humidity.   It‚Äôs also important to consider what that humidity will do for your hair!

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- October 29	labels:Hey guys, I just bought a black suit and was wondering what color dress shirt fits well with the suit. I was thinking navy or a white dress shirt.  What looks better in an office environment?
text:For future reference, I think the MFA community would agree with me when I say black suits are not as versatile as navy, grey or tan suits ‚Äì black suits have a somber or hyper-formal edge to them among suits, so for office wear they are a little less conventional than the aforementioned alternate colors. So, for the next suit you grab for the office, don‚Äôt be afraid to dip into some blues!  That being said, a black suit is a must-have piece, so I‚Äôm definitely not bashing your decision to pick one up. For office wear they‚Äôre tricky to pair with button downs, since the traditional pairing of black suit white shirt has shades of funeral wear and/or black tie event. With that said, depending on the formality of your office a black suit white shirt pair will look clean, and if the suit is well-fitting you‚Äôll look sharp. Rule of thumb is no black shirt black suit or red shirt black suit, since you‚Äôll look like a waiter or magician respectively (both of these can be broken sometimes, but not in the office capacity), but beyond this as long as your shirts are themselves something you‚Äôd wear to the office without a jacket the black suit will really work alright for everything equally (emphasis on alright ‚Äì see next paragraph)!   When you dip your toe back into the pool of suit shopping, keep track of what shirts you like wearing with your black suit. Most color combinations with black suits exist in a medium-to-ehhh space, with blue, navy, tan, and grey suits all being a bit more color-combination min-maxed ‚Äì this is because you‚Äôre not really combining colors with a black suit as much as you‚Äôre framing a color with black, so the synergy ceiling is lower than when you have the suit actively interacting with the shirt. There are many color-theory cheat sheets across MFA, so if you are curious for more check out threads about wearing suits and matching colors to get a feel for it! Hope this helps and cheers!	labels:A black suit is neither "hyper-formal" or a "must have". Outside of being a pallbearer at a funeral there is no need to own one and a navy suit is more appropriate in all other contexts.	episode_done:True

text:Technical/Labwear but make it fashion	labels:I work in an academic lab and my biggest way of bringing my style into lab has been building up a collection of cute statement studs in interesting shapes/ colors.    Outside of work my style is pretty fantasy-oriented and witchy ie. lots of bell sleeves, embroidery, velvet, the works.  In lab I generally tone it down to tighter 3/4 sleeve shirts in black or dark jewel tones.  For the bottoms I just wear long black pants and then add on some boots.
text:Our styles seem pretty similar (my style leans a little bit more 70s witch). Any work shirts that are your favorites?	labels:Ooh that sounds gorgeous! For my labwork I do end up wearing a lot of fast fashion since the risk of ruining the tops is so high. Two of my favorites are this [boat neck shirt](https://www2.hm.com/en_us/productpage.0664074001.html) from H&M and this [high neck shirt](https://www.uniqlo.com/us/en/women/sale?quickView=428310) from Uniqlo. For both shirts I ended up getting two colors each and they have lasted a while. The version of the Uniqlo shirts that I have is from a couple of years ago and it was cropped and ribbed, but the general look was the same as this link. Modcloth has also started making a lot of shirts with the same structure as the H&M top in a ton of different colors.	episode_done:True

Plus there are some Golden Bear collabs that mix it up. I'm still in the market, but I'm taking my time until the right thing comes around.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone invest in real jewelry?	labels:I don't have anything truly expensive, but everything I wear is 14k. I have a pair of diamond hug hoops from Ferkos Fine Jewelry that I bought for my birthday in September and they've been in 24/7 since. My last pair was Melissa Joy Manning and I wore them daily for three years, so I definitely get my money's worth. I have more rings than I wear daily, but not by much. Most of them are also from Ferkos. My bracelet is from Mejuri. I own two necklaces. The one I wear most is a n 18" 14k chain with initial pendant and the other is a 16" 14k chain with a tiny black pearl. I've had them so long that I'm blanking on the names right now. I do have a few more eclectic special occasion pieces that are just costume jewelry and they're all Alexis Bittar.	episode_done:True

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 13, 2020	labels:Hello, I was referred to this sub for help.  I'm a girl and looking for a bit of fashion advice for selecting a Disney/disney park outfit for my Fiance.  I'm aware it's super easy to go overboard and make a childish or slightly effeminate look when dealing with disney stuff. Which isn't my intention.  I'm getting married and honeymooning st Disney world next year2021. And I know we will be taking a lot of photos. And I want to gift my sweetheart a cool outfit to wear for pics.  He's late 20s-early 30s and normally he has a signature look of mixing hip-hop influence with comic/gaming stuff  I know disney characters he likes but I'm legit clueless for what men actually like to wear.(not what girls like on men)  So I guess my question is: What would you wear to a park, knowing you're going to take pics?  Any help is appreciated.  EDIT: Thank everyone for their input, I believe this is going to help me have a good chat and find some nice clothes for him :) very grateful to you all!

text:What did your mom teach you about fashion/style - and what did she not teach you?	labels:My mom placed a lot of emphasis on hygiene. She taught me how to wipe properly, never let me go to school with my hair messy (like she wouldn‚Äôt iron it but she would pull it back so it would be off my face), and she never let me leave the house stinky (you know that tween stink before they know of deodorant) and for all that I‚Äôve always been grateful. She also always made sure I had a properly fitting bra. When you‚Äôre growing up and your body is changing so dramatically is hard to keep up, but having cute, properly sized bras was a huge boost of confidence that I needed to deal with the teasing and awkwardness that comes from being one of your first friends to develop. Do NOT go to Victoria‚Äôs Secret. I would recommend Nordstrom for the first sizing and afterwards you can buy bras online with your proper size for much cheaper than you find in mall stores.   She also taught me the importance of personal appearance in a professional setting. Sadly it came from her having been bullied by her ‚Äútacky‚Äù clothes when she was young, but she saved me from making those same mistakes :) I often get complimented on my work style and I silently thank my mom every time.   She didn‚Äôt start encouraging me to do my eyebrows or shave until I was 15 (for my quinces, lol) which is age appropriate, I think. I feel bad for little girls whose moms pressure them into waxing or shaving when they‚Äôre still just... girls. At the same time, I don‚Äôt have heavy eyebrows so I‚Äôm not one to talk about that particular bit of experience.   She never slut shamed me, and she would encourage me to try trends. I would be the one to tell her ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care what people are wearing mom, I care what I like‚Äù and she respected that. She would only interject when she REALLY liked something and she would try to get me into it (haha), or to help me find styles and cuts that fit my emerging body shape better.   Also! She showed me how women‚Äôs sizing makes no sense, how you can be a size 4 in one brand and a 6 in another and an 8 in another and that the number DOESNT MATTER! All that matters is that they fit properly and comfortably. I love her for that. It‚Äôs like a little shield for my self esteem anytime I was struggling to find my pant size in store.	episode_done:True
text:What are some differences between stereotypical Millennial and Gen Z fashion/aesthetics?	labels:lol the honest difference is that one group is 10-15 years older than the other one, so they dress differently because....they have different concerns. I'm 25 (straddling the border a bit) and I honestly think the millenial/gen z divide is like, not real. Teens have always loved dunking on "uncool" adults, and this made up generational divide is just a shorthand way of conveying "what appeals to adults doesn't appeal to me, because i'm a teenager".	episode_done:True

I was looking at getting a pair of Irish Setter Wingshooters, specifically the 807 or 838. Would these still work in the city with, say, a pair of jeans and a field coat?

text:All-time favorite cold weather pieces?	labels:I'm with you on that and I hate the feeling of wearing 10s of layers to be able to go to work or for a drink. I also live in Central Europe so rain and wind is a big part of my everyday life. I'm trying to discover more and more sustainable (or not) pieces and brands that I can suggest:  * [Swedish Stockings](https://swedishstockings.com/pages/production-material) is one of my favorite stockings brand. You have a full sustainable brand from the materials to the zero-waste production that also offers stockings that are not just for one use. Most importantly, they are made for cold weather as they are made in Stockholm! * [HEATTECH](https://www.uniqlo.com/us/en/women/heattech) is the thermal collection of UNIQLO. I like to call it the SKIMS of thermal clothes because you have many type of clothing and also in various colors that you can wear them even under formalwear without freezing. I'm kind of reluctant with the sustainability of UNIQLO though. * For coats I always turn to thrift shopping. I find prices of good coats extremely high, while on thrift stores I have bought many long coats made of 100% wool or cashmere or alpaca wool for work and I have also purchased a [NORTH FACE](https://www.thenorthface.eu/nl_be/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwoJX8BRCZARIsAEWBFMJGC-GGlQvqOMrKmEhLEJqjPD-L7ZXVKo2dyn9AIP4W_wGscrCt-68aAg8sEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds) again from thrift store, but it's the hottest piece of clothing I own. * Gloves I purchased last year a pair of cashmere ones in TJMAXX. They were around 35$ but I think it worth the price. Personally I cannot go out of the house holding a bag and an umbrella with my hands completely naked. TJMAXX usually has a good variety of cashmere beanies, gloves, sweaters etc. * I forgot my favorite [Paraboot](https://www.paraboot.com/)! They are expensive I know but you can find various stock places around EU at least where the price is -30% to -50% and it definitely worths it. They are super warm very resistant to time, I have a pair of [boots](https://www.paraboot.com/femme/bottines/valdainegriff-marron-lis-fauve) and a pair of [mocassines](https://www.paraboot.com/femme/mocassins/vignonychasse-noire-lis-noir) that I wear for 3 years now non stop, nothing happened to them and they are the warmest bastards.	episode_done:True
text:How many clothes do you have? (Really?)	labels:I have way too much. Business casual stuff I wore for a job I haven‚Äôt had in 2 years but can‚Äôt seem to get rid of.

We have an oldish house -mid 70s build we moved into this past summer- that‚Äôs a work in progress so a lot of painting, ripping up floors, general manual labor clothes with stains, holes etc. my wardrobe is all over the place and needs a serious downsize.	episode_done:True

One pair with a contrasting pink stripe, one blue.  I owned a pair of gauchos. I refused to wear 'em.	episode_done:True
text:What are some habits that keep clothes/shoes new vs that habits that ruin them?	labels:For items you put in the dryer, make sure not to ‚Äúover dry‚Äù. Use cooler temps and remove promptly when just-dry. I‚Äôd rather have it a bit damp then super dry and warped. You can also remove the items one by one and flat-lay similar items one on top of another other. Like jeans folded in half in one bunch, shirts shaken out flat in another, etc..	episode_done:True

text:What is your "White Whale" fashion product that apparently doesn't exist?	labels:A romper that has the cute high/low effect.

I would prefer one pattern/color for the top, and then another color/pattern on bottom for shorts/long skirt back. And one that isn‚Äôt for teens.

text:Review your winter 2020/2021 outerwear: how did your coats and sweaters hold up this season? Would you recommend your specific brand to someone looking for warm layers.

Celine taught me that you don't have to have a cohesive "style", just wear what you want and what makes you happy even if it is over the top.

text:Does change in climate = change in style?	labels:I moved from a place which has four seasons but it often grey and overcast to a place just a little north of the tropics with a lot of heat and sun. I still favour similar shapes but now in much lighter fabrics. The biggest difference has been the amount of colour in my wardrobe. I‚Äôve gone from a mainly navy and blacks colour palette to wearing such a variety.

text:My ‚Äúbig‚Äù purchase was a Madewell leather bag and I LOVE it. I‚Äôm far too practical to spend more than $100 on a bag (currently have too many small children to even bring a purse anywhere- just a diaper bag) so my Madewell leather bag was a big one for me!	labels:I've never spent more than $50 on a purse/bag except once, when I got a $100 gift card to a boutique and needed a purse for work that wasn't from a thrift shop. I got a $200 Jack Rogers leather cross body purse, the cheapest in the store, but it was also my favorite because it was small and plain.	episode_done:True

I'd put up with every boring rehearsal for months just for the, like, four or five times we actually got to do the shows in the costumes. I loved them that much. (Didn't really care about acting or singing lol.)  From the start, it fascinated me how different clothes were used to signal things about different characters, and how different "normal" clothes were from time to time and place to place. I just loved it, and to this day haven't found much that fascinates me as much as clothing and the meanings we give it.  It's all my favorite things rolled into one: psychology, history, pop culture, biology, art. There's so many layers to it (and not just in the literal way-- har har), and just when I start to think I'm a little jaded, I find something in the past or on the horizon that always ends up pulling me back into the obsession.	episode_done:True

text:Bags that are actually beautiful - what are you loving?	labels:I‚Äôm also a fan of understated but elegant handbags. I bought a pre-loved Celine nano luggage that I have been loving. I enjoy Mulberry‚Äôs designs too and will probably get my next bag from there as their bags are relatively affordable compared to some of the bigger designer names. I love Chloe bags too but I think those might be a little too trendy and blingy for me.  Totally agree with you on Bottega, I think it‚Äôs overrated, especially the dumpling looking bags.
text:I was also considering getting the Mulberry Alexa (which I wanted back in the day), but it reads a little too cutesy to me, and in general Mulberry I associate with upper middle class 40+ Londoner, though I think their designs are really beautiful.   Agree with you on Chloe designs being nice but too trendy/iconic, I swear when I was younger there were so many nice bag designs (celine luggage, alexander wang cylinder satchel, proenza schouler etc.). I just can't with the boxy BV bags either or any bags that look like a hard square...  Feel like these bags are going to be out before they are in. Heavy branding on YSL bags has already cheapened their look to me. Love Cos/Madewell bags but the colour selection is boring (just black/tan). Meh!

text:What‚Äôs a piece you bought before the pandemic, but haven‚Äôt worn a single time since because the occasion has been cancelled/we have literally nowhere to go?	labels:A green gingham backless dress with a little cape over the shoulders for my college summer ball that was scheduled for last May. All my friends had put so much work into planning it.  Just hoping I actually get to go to one before I graduate so I don‚Äôt entirely miss out on the university experience I spent my whole life working towards.	episode_done:True

I am also loving the new plaid trend!	episode_done:True
text:What are some stores/brands that have surprised you?	labels:Some of the tops and dresses I‚Äôve gotten the most compliments on at work have been from Eddie Bauer. When I get surprised comments about it being an ‚Äòoutdoor store‚Äô I usually respond with ‚Äòwell...I‚Äôm indoors now so...‚Äô Has been great for me.  Also Ecco for shoes. So comfy and they last with lots of use/ abuse.
text:Eddie bauer men's sweaters are I N C R E D I B L E. My dad bought me a boys sweater at 12 years old and I really haven't looked back since. So warm! And they last forever. I have used and abused mine for quite a few years with no issues.   If you do end up interested in purchasing one, i prefer their "radiator fleece" to their regular fleece sweaters. They tend to be warmer and thicker.	labels:Eddie Bauer and Lands End both make clothes that wear like iron. I have a pink patterned dress I wear all the time during the summer and it‚Äôs just now starting to fade, after 6 or 7 years. It‚Äôs cotton too- which is hard to find in plus sizes but I do NOT want to wear polyester in the summer.  Pinks and reds are the first colors to fade in the wash.

I could get behind some of the comfy, colorful 2000s trends. Ugg boots never really disappeared in my mind (I live in a cold climate and these are a comfy winter staple for me). Also a big fan of loose fitting pants so I can get on board with gauchos/culottes coming back in.	episode_done:True
text:How do you think access and privilege affect your taste and sense of style?	labels:There was an interesting anecdote I read where it said that it was more expensive to be poor... things like dental work which can be done preventatively if you have money are put off until they become serious expenses when you are not also applies to fashion. For example, a poor man may buy $50 work boots that need to be replaced within a year whereas a more affluent person may buy $250 boots that last longer and are better at protecting his feet. Over time...the poor man spends more because he couldn‚Äôt afford the higher cost upfront.
text:Hah! Reminds me of Terry Pratchett!  > Take boots, for example. He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles.  > But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that'd still be keeping his feet dry in ten years' time, while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet."  > This was the Captain Samuel Vimes 'Boots' theory of socioeconomic unfairness.	labels:Yes!

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - November 23, 2020	labels:Why is buttoning the top button on your dress shirt so frowned upon? I guess for me I have a few issues when wearing a dress shirt. If I wear a v neck undershirt and unbutton my chest hair starts showing. I'm a very hairy dude and unless I'm grooming that part everyday it doesn't look very clean. I can wear a crew neck undershirt but I agree with everyone else that having some of that show can also look unclean.  The compromise I made is that I just button up the top for an overall clean look. I always thought it looked fine especially when I shave my face and clean up my hair.  Is the air tie look still a fashion faux pas or have things changed on that?

text:What was your first 'expensive' fashion purchase?	labels:I was the first person I knew to own 7 for all mankind jeans back when they had only one or two washes.

I also had like 10 pairs of the same pocketless, ultra low rise Diesel jeans in every color imaginable in HS.

text:How to avoid looking older with your clothing??	labels:I think it can sometimes be possible to accidentally make yourself look 14-going-on-55, but it‚Äôs not by wearing a currently trendy look like you‚Äôre talking about. It‚Äôs by not caring about clothes and letting your mom who also doesn‚Äôt care about clothes buy them for you. This happened to my sister and cousins back a couple decades ago, and it‚Äôs a bit weird to look back at pictures in their teens and see that they look older then than they do now in their mid thirties. The key is they had what were at the time the same haircuts and clothes their moms were wearing, and it made them look like they were dressing up as not particularly fashionable middle aged women. So...unless your mom has great personal style, don‚Äôt dress like your mom dresses right now and you should be fine.  On the other hand, I also have a cousin that took on some variant of what we‚Äôre now calling dark academia about 10-15 years ago, specifically thrifted professorial suits from the 80s. He didn‚Äôt look old. He looked like a 14 year old who decided to dress up as a 80s stockbroker for Halloween. It wasn‚Äôt aging, and if anything it make him look more of a kid because of the contrast.  So wear your tweed! You‚Äôll look like a 14 year old wearing tweed!

I only ever smell it in passing and have never had the chance to ask someone what they‚Äôre wearing. It‚Äôs a sweet but not too sweet, like a dry sweetness., cottony, clean linen, and powdery almost like a powder poof from back in the day.  Sounds insane, I know, but I would recognize it anywhere.

text:Gorpcore: How Arc‚Äôteryx Parkas and Salomon Hiking Boots Became High Fashion	labels:This is going to sound strange but hear me out and it'll make more sense.   The young and soon approaching middle age peoples prefer to live in the city. People are shifting towards walkable cities, or at least are trying.  People approaching their thirties, unlike in year's past, are not moving to the suburbs.   Living in the city, means that you would mostly not have a car. Using public transport, or walking/biking around means that you would be exposed to the elements much more than someone that lives in the suburbs and commutes everywhere by car. Being in a city also exposes people to hazards such as being sprayed by a car/bike driving past a huge puddle, wind tunnels, etc. Outdoor apparel, while a little overkill, handles these niggles much better than "fashion" apparel.   This is why I feel that they are getting more and more popular.

text:(UPDATE) Ladies who miss fashion/makeup/getting dressed up... how are you doing?	labels:I've had a chronic pain condition/disability the past four years that has made it difficult for me to get out to social activities and even difficult to take care of my appearance. After lots of physical therapy, exercise regimens, and medications, I got to a point where I was finally able to walk long distances without a cane and actually get in really good shape! And then the pandemic hit. And I had to move in with my parents where I don't even know anyone. So now I'm looking hot to trot literally, but can't show off my gains!   It can be demoralizing and make me feel like it's pointless to keep putting in the work, even though the benefits go way beyond just my appearance - reducing pain, increasing ability, decreasing medical bills, etc. It just really sucks that I already spent so long having to say no to parties, concerts, theater, and bar hangs with my friends due to pain and disability, and now that I've worked so hard to be on my feet again, all that stuff isn't even an option.   And I guess fashion is related in a way. It's how we visually communicate the significance of what we're doing and where we are and who we're with and who we're becoming in a way. We have fashion because we're so social and have a strong visual component to our communication as bodies in spaces. Looking back at the stuff I was able to go to during my years of disability, I have such distinct memories of being excited about my outfits and other people's outfits, conversations that flowed out of a compliment or question about cute shoes, new friendships arising out of a shared affinity for vintage velvet or puffy sleeves or bold lipstick, not to mention the occasional flirtatious exchanges thanks to a nicely fitted dress or skirt or the aforementioned bold lipstick. Heck, I even miss PLANNING outfits. Oof.
text:Oh, I definitely feel that. I've been living with multiple autoimmune disorders, including aggressive arthritis, for most of my adult life (I'm 51) so this limits what I can do physically, plus I'm the full-time carer for my elderly mom. So having events to go to where you can plan outfits, get all dressed up and your friends will be dressed up, and you can show off your outfits was fun.

text:Your favourite men's style shopping "hacks"	labels:Wanted to share some tips intended to aid your quick shopping on-site in a store. Hopefully, someone can find the following points relevant and take something away from this.  * Don't focus on brands and focus instead on the material construction of the clothes.    * A shoe is worth its weight in gold. Generally the heavier the shoe the better material it is made from. A common brand example which does earn a right to be praised for a single instance can be seen in how weighty Florsheim Oxford shoes are heavier than cheaper counterparts which rely on foam, plastics, or lighter rubber components to provide support.    * If it has a zipper that will be the first thing to fail in a way which can only be fixed with a sewing machine. Check to see the material around the zipper will impede its track progress (cheap nylon, or reversely, silk lining, etc.). Don't want those $300 suit slacks putting a hole in your seam or failing to open/close entirely. If you're buying second-hand pants, ALWAYS start by examining the zipper. You don't want to go home with your new threads and feel a breeze between your knees. * Don't let appearances fool you.    * Just because something says it's leather doesn't hint at quality. Examine the product to make sure it's not bonded leather. An [example](https://www.coach.com/coach-bonded-leather-jacket/88377.html) from the ladies aisle whose lesson is still applicable to us in the small men's section crouched in the back of the store but Coach is selling a bonded leather jacket for the low, low, low price of one month of my rent. Ironically, this is another reminder of my first point of avoiding buying solely by brand name. To note, a bonded leather belt or shoes are not likely to last long with the range of motion and pressure they have to undergo daily and are likely never worth buying for medium or long-term use.    * If you're thrifting don't worry about the little things such as dirt, missing laces, or scratches in leather. Insoles can be added or replaced. A buff and spit shine can hide those egregious scratches. Dirt can be removed with steam and a brush. Found a weighty pair of leather shoes at a local thrift priced at $6 which were scuffed and missing laces. They turned out to be Santoni Dante shoes.  I can go on with more points but I am interested to know if anyone has read my post and would like to know more.	episode_done:True
text:How do you style your existing wardrobe in a way that doesn‚Äôt get boring?	labels:I catalogued all my clothes in an app and track what I wear. If I want to wear something different\~\~\~ then I look at the category of "unworn" clothing and pick something to make an outfit with. It's really helped me make sure I wear as much of my clothes as possible (obviously the black cocktail dress is going to see less use than the everyday pink sweater but it helps with more unique items like my t shirt with applique parrots lol). If you don't want to catalogue your clothes and put this much effort into it (lol) you could just move your clothes to another part of your closet after you wear them or reverse the orientation of the hangers after wearing. Try to move as much of your clothes to the "worn" side of your closet as possible. And when you pick a lesser worn item don't give up and just make an outfit of it! Who cares if it doesn't match perfectly, you'll do it better next time!	episode_done:True
text:What do YOU do with "chub rub" jeans?	labels:[deleted]
text:This is what I do. But you have to do it BEFORE any thigh area gets rubbed all the way through. Use the whole patch to cover a big surface -- if you use a small patch, in my experience it starts coming unstuck and rolling up. Sew it on with matching thread if you really want to make it sturdy.	labels:I‚Äôm assuming you put it on the inside of the jeans? Does it feel irritating at all?	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else hate literally everything they put on?	labels:Sometimes I go on YouTube and find someone who have a similar body type and see what kind of things they wear. Could the problem be that the items you are wearing doesn‚Äôt suit your frame? I think that‚Äôs the most common reason why something doesn‚Äôt look good on someone. Have you tried experimenting with different items?   On a side note,  for me personally, when I start hating everything I wear, I tend to go back to basics. Basic tshirts, jeans or skirts, and neutral colors. Then I spruce it up with accessories like jewelry, bags, or hats and go from there. Its a lot easier to match when there‚Äôs a clean base to start with.
text:I honestly rarely see people with the same body type as me. I‚Äôm quite slim but I‚Äôve got MASSIVE shoulders, so things that look pretty and delicate on someone else just look wrong on me. Like I said I‚Äôve done the Kibbe system so I know what is supposed to suit me, it just doesnt translate well on me.   I think I‚Äôll try the basics thing though, thank you.	labels:Try Kibbe (13 body types) test. It's very interesting and far more detailed than "pear, apple etc"	episode_done:True
text:what pieces/brands did you buy when moving from a warmer climate to a cooler climate? what did you end up regretting/not using?	labels:Personally, I stick with natural fibers (wool & silk) over synthetics like fleece. I like silk scarves because they keep you warm without bulk & weight. I also love silk long underwear because they go under anything and keep you warm.     The soles of your shoes are also something to be aware of. If you have ice & snow, you‚Äôll want something with grip. You can also have rubber tread put on by a cobbler for a couple of bucks       You can easily winterize shoes with thin soles that you already own by adding a thermal insert. If they‚Äôre leather be sure and treat them with polish & moisturizer to keep them waterproof and flexible. Add some nice wool socks in the mix and you have winterized your shoes without breaking the bank.  You want to focus on keeping your core warm, along with your hands, feet, and head. Arms and legs aren‚Äôt super important if all other areas are warm.	episode_done:True

The way I see it, I have two choices... a) Purchase a pair of barely used shoes that haven't had their cork insoles "broken in" yet, and therefore have a better chance of forming to my feet better, or b) purchase a pair of cheaper shoes (\~$50) with the plan to send them to AE for recrafting which ensures that I get a fresh cork insole, along with a completely recrafted shoe.  Thoughts?  If I go with route (b), my final cost will be around $200. So I guess I need to see if I can find some barely used shoes for less than that. If not, the recrafting option may be just as good?

text:Fellow clothing trackers, what coveted items are you tracking now?	labels:Oh man... the first thing I ever felt like spending over $100 on was an amazing necklace at Anthropologie in 2006. Coral-themed glossy black enamel piece by Lee Angel. It was on sale for $125, but they couldn‚Äôt ship to Canada. I called around, looking for someone I could ship it to in the US, but by then it was too late. Sold out. I have mournfully half-hunted for it ever since!  Oops- thought that would go straight to the picture.

text:Can we make a thread of everyone posting their all time favorite Halloween costume they wore? üéÉüëª	labels:This was quite a long time ago (2009), but I‚Äôm still very proud of it.     AIG was a huge insurance company that got a big pile of cash (thanks Obama!) as part of the government bailout after the financial crash of 2008.   Promptly after receiving said bailout cash, the executives took a very expensive trip to a [spa](http://voices.washingtonpost.com/livecoverage/2008/10/after_bailout_aig_executives_h.html), which was generally not well received by anyone and created a huge scandal.  I went out and got a couple of fluffy white robes at Ocean State Job Lots for $10 each and some gold monogram letters from JoAnn fabrics and a pack of giant play money and some huge rhinestone jewelry from the dollar store.   Tacked the words ‚ÄúSPA AIG‚Äù on the breast pockets of the robes, tucked big piles of ‚Äútaxpayer dollars‚Äù into the pockets and sleeves, donned all the gaudy jewelry and gave my boyfriend a big fake cigar.   We wore khakis and white shirts and dark glasses and swept around the party telling everyone how *wonderful* and *relaxing* our spa vacation was.     There were people at that party who, while admiring our gall and chutzpah, kind of wanted to kick our asses.   üòÅ	episode_done:True

text:what are wardrobe items you own that you absolutely recommend to everyone else here?	labels:I'd recommend buying at least one item that is fairly flexible in terms of how you can wear it, but is a notch or two outside your normal price range - I'm not necessary advocating for buying it full price, there's great ways to catch these kinds of items on pretty significant sales (Yoox, year-end designer liquidations on Saks etc.) But having that one item that just makes you feel awesome has always been a great thing to have in my opinion. What that is is going to be different for everyone, and will even vary for an individual throughout their life - for me, it was once a Ralph Lauren Black Label shirt that always made me feel like I was king of the world when I was wearing it. These days, it's a couple of different Isaia items that just remind me how unbelievably comfortable (both in terms of softness and movement) any piece of clothing can be (even a blazer). I can't recommend Isaia enough (at least when you can catch a good sale), but what that item is and who makes it is really going to be a very personal thing - whatever it is, find something that makes you exude confidence. Maybe it's a splurge on a nice suede jacket, or that perfect soft blazer from Boglioli that always looks right no matter what you wear it with, or just a shockingly soft sweater that reminds you that a good sweater is not only not itchy, but something you'd sleep in if you could - it could even just be a really nice pair of boots.	episode_done:True

And retail price is 769 euro, which is steep.  So I was considering [this alternative](https://cdn-images.farfetch-contents.com/15/48/59/40/15485940_27886949_600.jpg) which is 3x cheaper but still 100% wool, and probably a bit longer which is good (the only thing I don‚Äôt like about the Beams one -apart from the price- is that it seems short), although I like the colour in the Beams one better.

I‚Äôve tested a few first date outfits and I‚Äôve found that a simple sleeveless top in a solid colour and a bit of a v-neck, paired with straight leg trousers/jeans work the best on me.

A lot of people have already mentioned these.   *  [Headbands](https://forevertwentysomethings.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/victoriassecret_headband.jpg) I had an absolute shitload of headbands. Maybe it was just me, but I swear other people were wearing them too.   * [Ballet flats, often worn with flares](https://cdn.cliqueinc.com/posts/281239/celebrities-wearing-ballet-pumps-281239-1563268200027-image.1080x0c.jpg?interlace=true&quality=70). I had about 8 different pairs of cheap ballet flats.  * In the late 2000s (approximately 2007-9), [flared](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1898/5197/products/Screenshot_34__edited_530x@2x.jpg?v=1566502652) and [capri length](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61gmvHTTAbL._AC_UY1000_.jpg) yoga pants were everywhere. I was anti-yoga pant and even I ended up acquiring a pair.   * Among hipsters, American Apparel reigned supreme. My friends and I were hipster-adjacent (a.k.a. we liked indie music but were dorks) and we all coveted those [zip up hoodies in every colour](http://www.ethicstar.com/flex-american-app-jacket.jpg).  * The infamous [dress or skirt over flares](https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1556209727560-GettyImages-78929382.jpeg?resize=600:*) was actually a thing, and yes, even at the time we kinda knew it was ridiculous. And yet, we did it anyway.   * Converse high-tops were huge, among both emos and non-emos. I myself had a plaid pair that I would definitely still wear today, had they not fallen apart. [And of course, we always wore them with flares](https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/7T8n5fLHVjqOSACdceUW8d4tQ9I/fit-in/2048xorig/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2019/01/28/899/n/1922564/c98c8e4e17d7207a_GettyImages-74537349/i/Selena-rocked-style-casual-babydoll-Converse-sneakers.jpg).

text:Winter jackets that are good for skiing and casual use?	labels:Dont go crazy on a jacket.  The key for skiing is layers and you can get a lot of layers that work well in other settings.   A decent base layer:  you can go merino or if you are on a budget milsurp poly pro.  A fleece over that.  Next layer is a beefier jacket.  Right now I have a half zip Patagonia that is poly insulated.  Then get a waterproof(ish) layer.  You have a lot of options but I usually run with a marmot precip.  It's cheap, has pit zips and folds up way smaller than a hard shell. That combo will cover you skiing 90%of the time and let you adjust depending o N conditions. Flexibility is the key.  Take the money you save and get some good socks and gloves/mittens and some type of balaclava.  No one ever came off of the mountain because their chest was cold but it was their hands/feet/face.
text:I disagree with only the last point. Your body prioritizes warming its core.

text:What are some unexpected surprises you've found with certain clothing brands that are known for other things?	labels:I bought a cord oversized overshirt from Edwin in the sale early last year and its probably my favourite piece of clothing i own.

Its super versatile and fits with just about anything i wear and can be worn as both an over sized shirt, layering piece and a jacket. Because of this i wear it pretty much all year round a couple days a week in many ways and it never feels out of place. They were a seasonal item but if they ever make their big shirts in large cord again i cannot recommend enough.
text:Edwin has a lot of interesting articles of clothing, however much of it is seasonal which really sucks.

Honestly, for me it was a lot of googling, but also a little trial and error. Finding out I don't like cashmere in my socks, for example, and then deciding it isn't hard-wearing enough to be useful for me inside boots - I like a tougher wool!

text:Post-Baby Problems I Wish Someone Had Warned Me About	labels:I‚Äôm almost 33w by now and I just stop fitting on my pre pregnancy clothes, but I guess I‚Äôm lucky because I all belly pregnancy, but I‚Äôm still afraid that my feet will grow (please don‚Äôt! I have a really big shoe collection). I know for fact that my hips haven‚Äôt grown yet, same with boobs, because I measure myself almost twice a week just to keep track.  I wonder if the rib cage is really common, tho? I alredy was pretty rectangle shape so my rib cage was alredy kinda wide. Second the shapewear, I use the one that cover the belly and it helps with my sciatica (recurrent problema over the years).   I‚Äôm really wondering about bra size, mine is the same for now, but when did you guys start seeing changes?
text:I‚Äôve known people who had permanent rib cage changes but more who had them go back to normal or close to it eventually.  I think it was the last month or two where my bra size changed but I just switched to bravado nursing bras because they‚Äôre pretty comfy & supportive without being restrictive. I think I picked up a few bras up one cup & band size around 6 months after but was back to normal size within a year (but I stopped breastfeeding around 5 months).	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Dae get overwhelmed by fashion?	labels:I think there are some great posts on here, just wanted to add, if you're just starting to build a wardrobe that feels "you" dont feel like you have to go out and buy it all at once.  Same goes with jewelry. Rather than trying to find a bunch of pieces you kind of like, find one or two pieces you love and make them signature, featured pieces in your wardrobe.	episode_done:True
text:If you had $5,000 to What-Not-To-Wear style re-do your whole wardrobe, how would you do it? What would be your process?

Then park myself on the couch and happily drown in the excess serotonin this aesthetic created (god I need some extra chemy bois right now).  [These](https://cdna.lystit.com/photos/justoneeye/7dcdd999/olivia-von-halle-Mamba-Coco-Mamba-Green-Silk-Pajama-Set.jpeg) are what I'm [envisaging](https://img.leprix.com/image/YGtzLT8vS4qIGWMoZdvP_IMG6056.JPG?fit=contain&w=1280&h=1280&q=90)...

text:Has anyone else ever tried on a designer item just to see what the hype is about?	labels:Whenever people talk about designer being "worth it" or the prices "justified" - people get all twisted up in knots because worth is so subjective and hugely variant based on personal taste, exposure, and personal finances. It's common in these discussions for negative connotations of high end designer to sneak in. The unsaid being that the woman who thinks the price tag of high end designer is justified is snobby, materialistic, classist, wasteful, a show-off, out of touch, or at very minimum - their values are out of whack and have they first prioritized their family and their 401k?  So let's put worth aside and just talk about whether or not there is a noticeable difference in quality (both material and construction). The short answer is yes. And typically, the more expensive you go, the more noticeable it is.   So how do you explain the whole "I spent so much $$$ on _________ and it wasn't better than _________"?   I visualize clothing quality as one large spectrum, and each brand with its own mini-range of quality in between. Not every ‚Äúname brand‚Äù has good quality. Most vary quite a bit - some pieces being good, some bad. The good items overlap with brands at a higher price point, the bad items overlap with brands at a lower price point and once in awhile an item performs spectacularly or fails spectacularly. Some people put all ‚Äúluxe designer‚Äù at the far right/top of the spectrum - but like everything else, there are different ‚Äútiers‚Äù that correspond with price point [think LV vs. Gucci vs. Chanel vs. Hermes handbags]. But back to clothes, the variation in quality is especially noticeable in the $100-200 per piece category (Frame, Theory, Vince, A.P.C., ATM, Lafayette 148 NYC, Rebecca Taylor, Veronica Beard ...there‚Äôs so many). Once you get really up there (Akris Punto, St. John, Adam Lippes, Brunello Cuccinnelli, The Row, Celine, Dior etc. etc.), the tolerance for mediocre quality really decreases but doesn't completely disappear.  But what about [insert exception here]? Yep. There's plenty of outliers where the hype or marketing or styling overcomes quality or vice versa. Speaking of quality alone, Reformation is hugely overpriced and Hanes ultraweight cotton basics hugely underpriced. Some designers put quality first, some designers put innovation first, some brands dominate a particular niche, others are old names recently acquired and gutted by private equity.   And now add to that the ‚Äúhuman error‚Äù in quality perception. The people reviewing who forgot that they bought a made-for-outlet item (or who don‚Äôt make the distinction); the ones that don‚Äôt differentiate between main line and diffusion lines and thus conclude that Ralph Lauren is mediocre to based on RLRL,  the ones that define quality as ‚ÄúI threw it in the washer AND dryer and it came out fine;‚Äù the ones that paid full price and the ones that thrifted it at 10% of the cost and their different expectations accordingly. And then fundamentally, quality is often evaluated by looking backwards - when I say my [brand name] sweater held up perfectly over 10 years, I‚Äôm really speaking about the quality of the brand 10 years ago and not today.  Still, we can generally say that from a 9000 f.t. perspective, price and quality generally go hand in hand.   So what is someone new to fashion or who could never afford [insert high end designer] make of all of that? What is "good," "bad", or "worth it"? I for one am a huge proponent of going to fancy stores (or even just the fancy corner of Nordstrom, Bloomingdales, or Saks) and just feeling the fabrics on the rack. Pre-COVID, I'd do this all the time. I really believe that anyone with no special knowledge of fabrics or construction can still quickly pick out high end designer pieces by feel alone, eyes closed. It's even better if you try on a piece or two. It's even better if you turn the shirt inside out and notice the hems, the clasps, the bias cut, the darting, the difference made by ‚Äúfully lined.‚Äù Maybe it inspires you to thrift. Maybe it helps you pick out the "good" for brands in your price range. Maybe it gets you to think about what makes this piece work? What do I like about it? What do I dislike? What clever things did the designer do? Or didn't do? There is really no substitute for seeing and feeling yourself.   I think the biggest barrier for many people trying this out is judgement. Sometimes it's imagined, sometimes it's real. I've definitely had sales associates not-subtly ask where I live, whether I own or rent, what I do for a living, etc. Sometimes they ignore me entirely. Sometimes they follow me around the store. Sometimes they are absolutely fantastic and helpful and I'm just having a negative-internal-dialogue day. Some people don't find it at all intimidating, others can brush that stuff off - I can on good days, can't on bad. If this is something you're interested in, high end consignment stores (or even normal thrift stores in very high end neighborhoods) are the bomb for a casual atmosphere and the opportunity to touch and feel the hell out of some really nice stuff.

I own a couple things from Frame, 3.1 Phillip Lim, and Rebecca Taylor, and the cardigan I got at 3.1 Phillip was super thin and flimsy, the jeans at Frame were thinner than Levis denim, but the 2 dresses and pants at Rebecca Taylor have held up pretty well and are well constructed and not thin.	labels:I can speak to A.P.C.‚Äôs quality especially in leather goods, outerwear, denim, and shirting.

text:Those Needles Track Pants	labels:[Plagiarized Needles Bio:](https://www.notre-shop.com/collections/needles)  >Needles is an in-house line of Keizo Shimizu‚Äôs NEPENTHES, a Japanese umbrella company that also operates Engineered Garments, RANDT, South2 West8, and AIE. Shimizu founded NEPENTHES in 1988 after working for the highly influential Japanese brand VAN and overseeing the store Redwood‚Äîthe first Japanese shop to import Nike and Air Jordan sneakers‚Äîwhere he worked with a young Daiki Suzuki. NEPENTHES, which Suzuki later joined, initially focused on importing American workwear and boots, but, as American brands began shifting production overseas, Shimizu decided to introduce his own line of American-inspired, Japanese-made goods. Produced entirely in Japan, Needles pulls form a range of influences, from films to musicians to artists, to present an eclectic yet refined range of offerings that include everything from velour track pants to rebuilt military jackets.  The Needles track pant is one of their signature, year-in year-out items. It is both a parody and celebration of the classic track pant, featuring five embroidered stripes and a stitch-pleated front. They come in dozens of colorways and luxe fabrics. The pants have found a unique niche in the confluence of Streetwear and Japanese Americana.  I hope the album shows off how diverse the styling on these pants is. You can wear them with milsurp, Needles & it's Nepenthes sister brands, athleisure and streetwear, or just a plain white tee.

text:Winter jackets that are good for skiing and casual use?	labels:A few questions you should ask yourself and that would also help others guide you:  * Have you been skiing before?   * If yes, then maybe you aren't likely to be down in the snow as much or crash and tumble a little bit. Then a general 'good enough' winter coat can be fine but limiting - if it gets soaked, if it snows harder than expected, if it's too warm and doesn't breathe well enough.   * If no, consider how good a time you'll have if your *non-waterproof* jacket gets soaked through (from touching down in the snow more than it can handle, tumbling, hard snow falling and seeping through). This can be discouraging to an already frustrating task of learning to ski. Ski jackets and hard shells are built a little tougher to handle some rougher usage and occasional tumbles.  * How much skiing are you likely to do and in what conditions?    * If you're only taking a few runs and then heading back to the lodge then siding with a more fashionable and maybe less technically sturdy jacket is fine.   * If you're going to go hard all day, rain or shine, snow and ice, come what may - then you'll not want to skimp on the better waterproofing and a fabric meant to keep up. * How much will it bother you if you're not completely prepared?   * It is a bummer, but it happens - gear fails. Things meant for skiing will hold up better when skiing vs. things that are meant for weekend wear.    * The best analogy is wearing wet socks. If the jacket gets soaked, are you fine with it? Or would you prefer something that is going to be fine even in a thunderstorm? * How much more skiing will you do in the future?    * Skiing is a frustratingly expensive recreational activity. If you mean to do this more then consider breaking this investment in two parts - a waterproof hard shell and an insulated mid-layer jacket.   * If you don't plan on doing this frequently you can get away with less and being slightly less prepared if things get extreme.  As for the Patagonia Isthmus - a few problems I'd have with it as a ski jacket:  * It is not waterproof. The cuffs and the bottom of the jacket will get wet and then soaked and then annoying. The hood and all of the fur fleece lining is going to be a sponge for everything wet ... in the snow ...  * It is lined with fleece/fur - so it has one temperature setting warm to hot - when you want to cool off your only option is to unzip your jacket, which may not be enough, comfortable, or advisable. * It does not vent (see above)  As for recommendations:  * There are a few 3-in-1 jacket options that brands make ... Patagonia has one, North Face also, that break down the layers in a single purchase.  * Otherwise you can cobble it together yourself with a waterproof shell, insulated hoodie/jacket, some thickness of baselayer (wool, fleece, poly, etc.) - This may be more expensive, but think of it as more flexible and reusable as each piece is useful on its own in other scenarios vs. 1 insulated winter coat that's mainly only useful when it's freezing or snowing.	episode_done:True

text:How do you think access and privilege affect your taste and sense of style?	labels:Grew up middle class, but didn't have much of a clothing budget and my mom refused to let me buy clothes at thrift stores so I didn't have much ability to develop style. I had little interest in fashion because my options were too limited, not just because of budget but because of the school dress code. When I was a senior in high school I finally got my own job and I could spend my money how I wanted so I could get those sweet sweet thrift store clothes. (plus fast fashion was really catching on so I had that too)  In college, dress codes were no longer a concern so I had even more freedom to try different styles even though I still didn't have much money. You can be stylish even on a low income budget. I more or less have the clothes I want. I would like to get higher end items but I still don't make much money so that's not much of an option.

In the summer I go through my wardrobe, see what I need, make a nice list of needs/wants, set a budget for overall shopping (usually about $200), then meticulously search out pieces that match up to the list keeping a spread sheet of what I bought, from where, how much I spent, etc. Most, but not all, is shopped for online or second hand because of my budget and because I have the time in the summer to do it.  Any other time during the year, it‚Äôs much less planned out. If it‚Äôs in person shopping, it‚Äôs usually impulsive. If it‚Äôs online, I usually save it or like it and never come back to it.

Then another one that I loved but maybe because vintage 80s are back, was Betty from season 2 in Dirty John... it‚Äôs really a great way to present 80s fashion to 2020 viewers!	episode_done:True
text:There is no unmarked woman	labels:Interesting, but oddly dated article.  I think it's important to give this particular article context:  published in 1993, three years after Butler's *Gender Trouble*, but before Butler started to draw criticism in the late 90s.  I think of this article as something of a Judith Butler lite, so anyone who is really interested in reading more should pick up some Butler.  As a student in the just barely post-Butler years, I would say the biggest critique of this type of reflection is it is centered primarily in 1) English language; 2) Western dress; and 3) the middle class and above.  In other words, it gets kind of wonky when you start examining other cultures, languages, or even any situation that directly talks about class.  For example, is a farmhand in rural America with closely cropped hair, flannel shirt, and work boots butch or practical‚Äîis she marked by gender or class?  And while we, in our perhaps comfortable bedrooms, theorize about what her clothes might mean, I find that such discourse bypasses the obvious solution:  we could just ask her.  The difference grows even more pronounced as you move into other cultures with varying gender expressions and norms; for example, what about a society where almost all their constituents are marked in quite a literal sense like the Maori?  Can we still say that men are unmarked while women are marked?  Or what about a language that does not differentiate between male and female nouns in the way English does?  I think that this article is really thought provoking for a specific place; but it soon loses its appeal when you stretch it out and beyond.  The idea of sex and performance being two wholly different phenomena was groundbreaking and is groundbreaking.  It's the basis of a lot of queer theory.  But at the same time, there's a point where it kind of breaks down when it's not appropriately married to subjectivity.  Edited to add, as I was taken off by daughter's bathtime:  In some ways, it sounds a little less condescending in theory.  What I mean by that is when I read Butler in relation to, say, Rosalind's gender presentation in *As You Like It*, I can wholly appreciate that Rosalind is not real and was written by someone who made conscious choices in her rendering.  The critique of those choices feels like a critique of intent.  When I read this article, it feels something less like a critique of intent and more like a critique of‚Äîwell, women.  If a woman wants to wear a full face of makeup, then the supposition might not be that she is performing femininity, but that she has terrible acne that she's horribly self-conscious of.  But no one is asking that woman, we're just assuming that she's got this outward-facing message for the world that she might not actually have.  (Though certainly the world is imposing a message on her; but the idea of being marked in this article also denotes a choice to be marked a certain way‚Äîthat she chose to wear makeup so she could look attractive to others.)  We're writing the message in for her, where none had been printed before by her and it's also not a message she necessarily intends.  And that feels to me...a little strange.
text:To provide a little more context, this was not originally Tannen‚Äôs specialty. She published on communication styles - cross cultural, I think - with a small amount of material on how gender influences that. And it blew up - 90% of the attention she got was on less than 10% of the material. You Just Don‚Äôt Understand was the book that grew out of that (1990, same year as the book you cite), and for a time she came to be regarded as a popular voice on gender issues.	labels:Yes; and I do admit I am not an expert in linguistics.  I think it‚Äôs interesting also because this was published in the NYT, which led me to wonder what parts had been detoothed for the general readership.  I feel like this was published as an accessible article on this relatively newfangled area of thought; which, you know, it‚Äôs understandable since it is the New York Times and not the Princeton Press.  But in doing so, it also reveals the age of the article‚Äîand I thought it would be remiss to note how the conversation has changed.    I do wonder what an article like this would be like today.  Would it be more or less comprehensive?  Would it talk more about class, race, etc?  As our popular discourse has grown more intersectional, but also more specialized, it‚Äôs also really hard for me to imagine just what a new iteration would be like.  And really, with the relative sophistication of the youth, I also wonder what a Teen Vogue iteration might be like (and if would be even better and more inclusive than an equal New York Times version).	episode_done:True

Problem is, I bought it halfway around the globe, nearly a decade ago, and am having trouble finding a good replacement online. A few desired features:  * Warm but breathable (my old one was merino wool, which was amazing); mid-weight * Zip-up * French terry * Cheaper and more durable is always better, but the main emphasis is comfort. I don't care if it's especially fashionable. Let's try to keep it around $100 or less? * I'd prefer no hood, but a hood is fine, I guess  Any suggestions?

text:[Serious answers only] FAQ: Why does runway fashion looks like nothing you'd ordinarily wear on the daily?	labels:You've got a lot of great answers here but I'll chime in with something food related.  I work in food and I think fashion and food are very similar.  Have you ever heard of Heston Blumenthal?  Probably not.  He's a fine dining chef in England.  He's done a lot of wacky stuff with molecular gastronomy but that's out of vogue now, the equivalent of a deep v neck shirt.  Blumenthal did a one off desert for tasting menu of 20+ courses in the early 2000s.  One of the desserts had chocolate paired with Bacon, and the food critic thought it was clever.  Smash cut 20 years and you've got bacon flavored body wash.  Yes, it's food you can still eat but fine dining ostensibly seeks to reimagine what we eat, where our food comes from and why we eat it.  It's a genre within a genre.  I look at it the same way as runway fashion.  Only people who are really into food go to expensive tasting menu restaurants.  Only people really into fashion go to runway shows.  You can disregard it as being silly or bizarre and over the top, because it is.  It's still going to cause you to eat a chocolate bar with bacon in it or a Nashville hot chicken sandwich or Korean street food one or five or ten years down the line.

text:Dae get overwhelmed by fashion?	labels:For sure. I recently have been trying to find my style and on one hand I would like to dress a little more girly with skirts and blouses but I‚Äôm so used to jeans and a tee that I feel ... I guess out of place? Also when I would wear more revealing outfits (pre COVID ) to go out to bars or to parties I would feel goofy almost. Like the outfit that isn‚Äôt terrible but it didn‚Äôt feel like me but at the same time you aren‚Äôt going out to a nightclub with a cardigan and leggings so you HAVE to wear something sexy.    That‚Äôs also all not accounting that sometimes you have a bunch of stuff but it seems like nothing *goes* together. Then you feel like you‚Äôre just throwing crap together and you end up with ??????
text:I relate to everything you said. Especially the whole, having a bunch of stuff that doesn't go together. Like you, I want to wear more skirts and dresses and overall dress more girly. But unless I buy an entire outfit, the skirt/dress alone doesn't go with anything in my closet, so I end up not wearing it at all üôÉ	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Review your winter 2020/2021 outerwear: how did your coats and sweaters hold up this season? Would you recommend your specific brand to someone looking for warm layers.

text:Which style did you get?	labels:I had to look it up but it is called the Shelburne and I liked it because it has fleece lined pockets and was longer than the other ones I tried - without being full length (enough coverage to keep the butt and thighs warm without restricting movement or looking ridiculous - imho)	episode_done:True
text:What are some stores/brands that have surprised you?	labels:Some of the tops and dresses I‚Äôve gotten the most compliments on at work have been from Eddie Bauer.

So comfy and they last with lots of use/ abuse.
text:We've been an Eddie Bauer family for *years* \- both their indoor/daily clothes as well as their outerwear. My husband was shook when I took him shopping there for the first time - it's one of the only stores where we can find clothes that actually fit him because they carry 'tall' in regular sizing. The clothes last forever and have a lifetime guarantee (handy for the coats).	labels:Soooo does that mean I could send my husband their way for pants? He‚Äôs 6‚Äô3‚Äù and tends toward the slimmer waist sizes that you just can‚Äôt find with that length!

I was riveted by the idea of constantly being aware of being looked at - here in the quote, by men but also by other women, too, I think:   ‚ÄúOne might simplify this by saying: men act and women appear. Men look at women. Women watch themselves being looked at. This determines not only most relations between men and women but also the relation of women to themselves. The surveyor of woman in herself is male: the surveyed female. Thus she turns herself into an object - and most particularly an object of vision: a sight.‚Äù

text:Is fast fashion really fast fashion if you get years of use out of the garments?	labels:Sustainability professional chiming in - I think this topic really hits on a theme in sustainability that is difficult and frustrating to understand: sustainability is full of trade offs. It makes selecting the ‚Äúsustainable option‚Äù nuanced and compromising for individual consumers. While I think awareness of the impact of your choices is incredibly valuable and focusing on sustainability as a priority when exercising your purchase power makes a difference, I really resent the pressure being put on individuals to ‚Äúmake the right choice‚Äù when it comes at a cost (either literally or figuratively) in another scenario.  Companies have spent decades funding the message that we, the individual consumers, are responsible for the impact consumerism has on the environment. While supply and demand obviously go hand in hand, the true goal for individual consumers should be focusing their voting power on demanding companies take responsibility of intersectional sustainability (ie you shouldn‚Äôt have to be privileged to purchase sustainable products). Change does come with purchase power, but right now there will always be a trade off. It‚Äôs up to voting for government officials and policies that give ownership of the problem as shared responsibility between consumers and companies (but primarily on companies).  All in all, outside of voting, the best thing you can do is be conscious of what you‚Äôre purchasing and where it goes when you‚Äôre done with it. Align to priorities that map to yours (whether it‚Äôs low carbon impact, human rights, circular economics, water / land impact etc), and do the best you can in that area understanding there‚Äôs other consumers who prioritize other aspects of sustainability that are meaningful to them. Even if you can‚Äôt find the perfect solution, every conscious effort helps.
text:This. I work in sustainability as well. Sorry to piggyback on your post, but it‚Äôs not just voting. Make a stink to your elected officials. Write them letters. Get your friends to make a stink too. The more attention this topic is getting, the more likely these government officials will be motivated to do something about it (ie put money towards it) and put policies and regulations in place. And don‚Äôt stop at elected officials either, write to your favourite companies as well. Comment on their social media. You‚Äôre dang right they read your comments. Shit tons of money doesn‚Äôt go in to market and consumer behaviour studies every year for nothing. These companies want to know what you want and how to sell it to you.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:How many clothes do you have? (Really?)	labels:I use a random number generator to pick a thing from my closet to build an outfit around. The default setting is between 1 and 100. On average, my actual count tops out at 87, so I probably have about 95-100 garments in my closet if all my laundry is up to date? The things I don't hang are: athletic wear, loungewear, t-shirts, socks and underwear.   Of course my closet also contains several items that can't be used to create an everyday outfit, like my wedding dress or my black satin evening gown. I have a work cocktail dress and a business bitch cocktail dress that I can't dress down even a little.  I have been tracking my outfits pretty religiously since December, though. I'm hoping that after 12 months I can get rid of anything that hasn't been worn enough (unless it's special) and start shopping from there. I haven't bought any new clothes for a few months and I don't plan to buy any this year because I moved and that shit is expensive.
text:I would never have thought of the random number generator.

text:advice on how to stop buying clothes I don't need?	labels:Wow, I‚Äôm literally in the same situation as you right now, everything you described right down to the Aritzia super puff! My shopping habits have been getting worse since the pandemic, since I‚Äôm home all day with increased screen time. It got to the point where I had a few packages per week and often I even got clothes I ended up not wearing. Im huge sucker for trends too. Ive been good about not shopping the last few weeks. Here‚Äôs some things that helped me:  -  Staying off social media. The algorithms are so exact that it will pray on my weaknesses knowing exactly what brands and styles I would like. I often get new arrival ads from stores I visit frequently. Recently I‚Äôve just blocked those account/ads (theres an option to not see the ad or block the acc) so I don‚Äôt see them anymore. Social media is a huge trigger for me so I try to stay off it.  - Instead of purchasing the item, I have been texting the link to the item to myself! Its kind of the same concept as adding to cart and buying, but I find that adding to cart is too close of a temptation since it only takes a few clicks from there  - Recently, I‚Äôve rounded up some of my other friends who like to buy trendy clothes, and asked them if they wanted to do a ‚ÄúNo Buy November‚Äù where we refrain from buying unnecessary stuff. Whenever I feel the urge, I will just text this group of friends instead and we discourage each other from buying. Making it into somewhat a game, and having my friends roast me for wanting to shop is actually really helpful lol  - I started reading a book ‚ÄúTo Buy or Not to Buy‚Äù  It talks about shopping addictions and dives into what are common triggers that cause people to shop. What are your triggers for shopping? Is it boredom? Desire for a certain lifestyle? etc. For me, my trigger is boredom + growing up, my parents were strict and controlling w how I spent my money and the clothes I wore, so as an adult its easy to lose control shopping when I have the money & freedom  - Since I was shopping often, I noticed I‚Äôll buy things that are very similar to what I already have so instead of shopping, Ill just look through my closet for similar pieces that replicate the ‚Äúvibe‚Äù or ‚Äúlook‚Äù I want  - I‚Äôve started to clean out my closet by selling stuff I never wear on Depop or Offerup as to redirect my energy and make some money instead of spending  - Ask yourself why you want that piece of clothing, and really ask yourself how often you‚Äôre actually going to wear it. I think going on a No shop november has allowed me to be more intentional when having the urge to make a purchase!	episode_done:True

In my own wardrobe I use pastel and millennial pink as my main neutral color.

text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE!- October 20	labels:So last year I bought [these pants](https://bananarepublic.gapcanada.ca/webcontent/0016/705/907/cn16705907.jpg). They're comfortable and I like the look of them. I have a white dress shirt I pair it with. I got flack last year because I wore a blazer that I normally wear but it's cotton. So the material didn't match and it looked not great.  Have my work Christmas Party coming up, would love to keep the pants, maybe even the dress shirt, although I am open to different ideas. Just want something that looks decent. What can I pair these pants with for a good look?

text:[Inspiration] Jewelry	labels:Cool stuff. Looking at this got me wondering.  Every outfit there is definitely on the casual side. I‚Äôm always curious to see how it would look with business casual and business formal wear, without being over the top.  Working on Wall Street, the only jewelry I‚Äôve seen are cuff links, watches, rings, and occasionally wrist beads or bracelets. There was one stylish black man who would wear diamond studs with suits but that‚Äôs about it.  Curious if anyone has examples of subtle jewelry with suits and business casual outfits.
text:During the height of #menswear people were copying many of the Italians and wearing multiple beaded and/or leather bracelets which are a bit more lowkey since they don‚Äôt shine like metal. A single signet ring on the pinky probably wouldn‚Äôt draw that much attention given the old-school tradition of it. And if you‚Äôll allow me to plug myself a little bit, some of my waywt posts have me wearing some rings and bracelets even with my tailoring, though it may not be super visible. Metal jewellery primarily has the intent of being seen though, so you will be making a statement by combining it with tailoring.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Daily Questions - ASK AND ANSWER HERE! - December 04, 2020	labels:What is the opinion on Wholecut dress shoes? I've already got black and brown captoes but wanted to branch out.  Is creasing a problem on Wholecuts? Captoes seem easier to polish because the cap gives a nice landmark.
text:The French love them.  Wrinkling-creasing - you really have no idea what you are going to get. If the last fits you very well, probably less creasing. If you happen to get good hides, probably less creasing.  I have an old pair of Alfred Sargent made for Brooks Brothers Chelseas - these fuckers DO NOT CREASE. Do I think that necessarily makes AS a must buy brand? Nah. Do I think that AS made shoes for BB to an impossibly high standard - not likely (I believe the rumor is that before Gaziano and Girling had their own factory, AS made for them). Basically, I think it is just blind luck that these shoes don't really store creases.   Stylistically, I go back and forth with them, but I do worry about how they look worn in. I have yet to take the plunge.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Are our ideas about what looks ‚Äúdated‚Äù on either ourselves or others affected by or correlated with our age?	labels:For me (almost 34), I think it's the progression of time seems to have sped up. It's like, I buy a pair of designer jeans (an investment!) and get a good season out of them. I love them. Then I get pregnant and have to do maternity clothes for almost a year (barf). Then post partum changes your body and I just miss my old clothes. I can't fit in them so miss another season. By the time you lose the weight and can fit in your favorite jeans, it's summer. Okay, I'll wait for fall. Fall comes and apparently the waist height is dated? That's bullshit, you JUST bought them.. 3 years ago. That doesn't feel like that long ago.  It was the same with some over the knee boots I bought 5yrs ago. Beautiful leather. I wore them one season, then pregnancy changed my shoe size. Then the post partum phase I was always bending over and on the floor, things over the knee boots did not do well. I needed slip ons. Okay. The next 3 years and two more kids, can't wait till I'm back in the life phase where I can wear my boots! Except now they're 'dated'. Again, total bullshit. Shoes should be fashionable for that period of time. Ugh, I'm wearing them anyway.   Just my theory. I'm currently super frustrated by t shirt lengths. I can't keep my jeans and buy new t-shirts. I now need to update all my jeans or show an awkward amount of stomach. I'll do it, but I'm going to be old and grumpy while I do it.	episode_done:True

text:Sewing is a lot like cooking. With a pattern, like a recipe, it's not too hard to make even somewhat complicated things as long as you have the right fabric, thread, and tools, just as you would need the right ingredients and tools to cook a nice meal. There is of course a large element of artistry that comes with serious sewing skills, as with real cooking skills, but up to a certain point it's just following directions carefully.

text:Is Y2K fashion coming back organically or is it a result of progressing the 90's comeback to the next decade since that trend seemed to work out?	labels:Everything eventually comes back in fashion.  Personally I would love for 2000s jeans to come back - not super low rise or the ones that were bedazzled or laced up but just normal rise bootcut and flare jeans. I have a few from that era that I still wear all the time and a couple more that I had to replace with similar ones from poshmark because I couldn't find them in shops.  I also miss 2000s makeup. Sure, there was too much body glitter and candy colors but there was also the fresh dewy look of blush and a light lip gloss - think Britney Spears in her Oops I Did It Again video, or Mandy Moore's makeup in her video for Candy. Not everything in the 2000s was horrible lol.
text:Of course not everything from the 2000's was horrible! I didn't mean for it to sound that way. I never thought about the makeup looks, I think that would be nice to see similar makeup looks nowadays.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What rules do you break for your body type?	labels:I don't know if this is an actual "rule" or not, but most of my friends growing up were super thin with little curves. I was always much curvier and was always jealous of how they could seemingly pull off anything and still look classy/fashionable. I always felt like if I wore similar clothes (like some examples listed here - turtlenecks/high neck shirts and also crop tops, deep v necks, bralettes in summer, etc) there was an instant , almost negative, sex appeal added and I was always pretty insecure.  Well probably around the time I graduated college, I just stopped caring. So what if a turtleneck accentuates my boobs? Who cares if I wear a crop top in summer when it's 100 degrees? I find that I'm still dressing pretty "young" in my late 20's because I was too insecure to feel comfortable in the styles when I was younger. But I'm having a great time!
text:I know the pain. For some reason women and gay men think it‚Äôs ok to loudly talk about the size of my boobs, which I HATE, and then of course there‚Äôs the creeps we all know about. I want to have the confidence to wear a turtleneck or high neckline because I like how classy they look. But right now in my early 30s it‚Äôs still all scoop necks and v necks for me. Crop tops too if they don‚Äôt have a high neck. Idk why I‚Äôm ranting here I just want to be like you one day. The body type a person is born with isn‚Äôt provocative! It‚Äôs a body.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How did you curate/purge your wardrobe specifically for moving? What pieces did you bring when moving to a drastically different climate? What other fashion moving tips do people have?	labels:If you can avoid getting rid of anything not extremely destroyed, do so, and use pieces that aren't fragile or special to wrap fragile items.   You may need clothes you can destroy while painting or setting up the new place.   As someone else mentioned, getting used to one climate is a serious thing and you may not forsee how well you do or don't cope with the weather there.   Finally, styles and lifestyles often change when you move and things you consider absolutely necessary or unnecessary now may switch entirely. Your weight may change because of the new lifestyle, or you may decide to go for a new look after experiencing the new culture and moves are so expensive the last thing you need is the costs of trying out and buying an entirely new wardrobe once you get there.   Even if you don't stay in love with all of the pieces you moved with you can try new combinations of them while you work out your new style and then go out and buy pieces that you really love to round that style out.	episode_done:True
text:People with crazy hair, how do you plan your outfits to go with your hair color?	labels:Ive had colored hair for 10ish years I just accept the chaos mostly and may continueto but I have a plan lately. Basically in an effort to look more put together and to not buy things I won't use I have chosen a color pallet that  works together and can be mixed and matched and all that. Its  based mainly around the colors already in my wardrobe and my favorite colors. I went with 2 neutrals 2 colors that I will have in various shades and 1 very particular shade of green. I'm planning on sticking to dying my hair in my signature colors or at least colors that will go with my pallet.	episode_done:True

text:BoF: J. Crew's New CEO has a Survival Plan: Edit out the Ugly	labels:I have a love/hate thing with J Crew. I was really into it for a few years (just out of college, had some disposable income, but didn't really know what I wanted to be or look like) then things started getting... Really fucking weird.   Want a neck ruffle? Have a stack of those things up near your head area, don't worry, your shoulders will look absolutely enormous! You don't need let anyone else know where your waist is, that's between us!  Here are the elastic waist accordian pleat skirts in patterns that you will force yourself to like, kinda (you hate them.) You can tuck the ruffle top in. Your aunt will tell you that you "look sharp."  Here's a $300 version of that coat from Amazon that all of the women from Urbanmommy liked for some reason eight years ago. It's not warm.   Have a popover! What's that? It's a half button down with absolutely zero shape. Just none. It's also real stiff, so, you know, deal with that. We will enthusiastically offer you ten of these because when a garment looks good with nothing it technically, legally, goes with everything.   Have a really large ruffled wrap skirt. It's practical for literally nothing. No workplace, no event, you'll buy it though, because it's fun! *It's khaki* because this is a J Crew, ma'am.  Wear this boatneck top off the shoulder! What? That looks really fucking stupid when you do it? It looked good in our editorial, you should really try it that way. It's $48.   Paperbag waist pants with enormous wide legs are available, and did you know you can just pull them all the way up over your head and cinch the ties? Like your own personal worry cubby. We want for you to dress like you are your anxiety disorder.   Here's an interesting top; it's a bag with arm holes and an oversized velvet tie. Just cinch it around your shoulders. It's chambray. Don't wash it, this is the best it'll ever look.   Remember Chanel jackets? We could've made a similar garment with decent tailoring and fine detailing, but we didn't do that. This one has fringe though!   It's the pirate dress that you bought because it was on sale! It's made of gauzy linen cotton forgettable fabric and it has a lace up placket in the front! It's like the tops that Reformation and Alexander Wang made last year but not really because it's just the lace up detail on a hospital gown.   I could keep going but I won't, I wish they'd just stop getting weird with it and would just produce well fitting, preppy basics at a mid range price point. A long time ago, I noticed as I was shopping that I would gravitate toward pieces that were well executed, regardless of design. Garments that did a good job of being what they were meant to be. J Crew used to do that, they haven't in awhile.  ETA: What I think that j crew gets wrong, and why I think the brand hasn't aged well, is that fast fashion brands and companies like ASOS stopped coddling consumers with watered down versions of the trends that they'd see on celebrities and in magazines (and later on social media) and simply gave them cheaper versions of those items. ASOS frequently has really daring, on trend pieces and they're well done. The quality isn't going to be on par with heritage brands or premier designers, and the clothes aren't exact replicas, but they're dupes and they're fun and they're accessible. Things that 15 years ago you really couldn't hope to own at an average income are available in a much more egalitarian way, and I can understand why people look a J Crew, with those very safe, neutered versions of high fashion designs at their price points and take a pass.
text:Thank you for this comment! Every time I‚Äôve gone into JCrew as an adult I spot something I might like or am looking for then find out it‚Äôs got something *extra* that‚Äôs way to trendy/unpractical/after-thought once I pick it up. When I do find something worth trying on it inevitably fits strange or is just too darn stiff.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Decolonize Sustainable and Ethical Fashion	labels:While I like what the article is saying, but they are misusing the word 'decolonizing'. Decolonization is not a metaphor.
text:Can you elaborate on this a bit? I understand the term as being used literally here, since it's a call to action to cease supporting brands that rely on colonialist exploitation of workers in poorer countries. Not that this is the primary mode of decolonization, but I don't understand how this small action is metaphorical.	labels:They are referring to an article by Tuck & Yang called "Decolonization is not a metaphor". Tuck & Yang are talking about how the phrase decolonization gets used far too much as a metaphor in fields like education to discuss how to make theory and practice better, but that it has become a buzzword for a catch-all that refers to anything trying to diversify or remedy issues in the field. However, in the context of settler colonialism, in order to actually "decolonize" anything in North America we must be actually working towards dismantling the colonial structures and giving land back to indigenous communities. If academics [or regular settlers] are focused only on metaphorical "decolonization", ie. making symbolic moves, then we lose sight of the real goal, which is #landback. However, while I LOVE Tuck & Yang article, I think there is a place for metaphorical decolonization, especially in terms of colonized peoples being able to decolonize their minds and lives in as much as they can under settler colonialism. There are also metaphorical ways to work TOWARDS dismantling the structures that prop up colonialism that aren't necessary providing land back. Additionally, there are other forms of colonialism, not just the on-going current settler colonialism of Turtle Island [North America] Hopefully that helps!	episode_done:True

text:Changing your mindset from fast fashion to one of investment pieces. What did you learn?	labels:That it's exhausting and sometimes drives me to a weird point of obsession to be determined to find the perfect _______ (whatever item I'm after). It's both a money thing and an ethical thing. Money thing because if I'm dropping $$ on something better made, from a more reputable brand, better features etc. then I need to rationalise dropping said $$ on it on a student budget. Ethically, if I'm trying to limit or eliminate my fast fashion footprint, it doesn't make sense to then buy multiple versions of investment pieces in the hope of finding the ideal one. So the amount of research and time I'll spend on my fashion choices is often tiring AF and makes me ironically feel more consumerist and materialistic (despite it representing the opposite) because of how much mental space these things will take up.	episode_done:True

text:Rant - I'm fed up with fashion and "expressing myself"	labels:How often are you shopping? Would you say this is more of a fashion issue or an issue with spending. If you wore everything you bought I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a fashion thing but if the clothes sat and did nothing than I‚Äôd think it was a spending thing.   Perhaps a bit of both?! I have felt this on and off in my life and whenever it would happen it was during times where I felt inadequate elsewhere or feeling misunderstood in a way?! When I felt good, like actually good, my clothes more so wore me. It‚Äôs the cheesiest thing I know, but when at ease in your mind your clothes find you. I grew up lower income so hand me downs in my fam were a must as well as clearance shopping. This made me love the hunt of finding great items with the means I had BUT as I got older it created a spending issue because I loved fashion and finally had money of my own. The lack of money made me creative in my clothing but having the money made me excessive with the ‚Äúcreativity‚Äù.   From the trend perspective, I worked as a makeup artist for ten years and through these spaces I began to feel out of place. My skin wasn‚Äôt my own if that makes sense. Some MUAs were so tatted and pierced and had crazy hair, others were like high glam, and on shoots is where I felt the most out of place. I was observing too many similar things and feeling like I had to fit in. In those moments, I would spend. It felt good to buy and review a product or show off a new top (only to see it turn to shit 6 months later). The cycle was so repetitive at times!   I‚Äôve only recently grown out of it. We‚Äôre only human. Think of what you consume and if it‚Äôs too much. Step outside of the fashion environment and that‚Äôs where you end up finding your style and your clothes. Also, start thrifting, the hunt is so fun. I wish you luck on your new journey!!! If you ever wanna talk clothes message me!
text:Thank you very much for your comment! I guess it does correlate to spending when I'm stressed out, more panic and doubt equals more money spent. So I can easily see what you mean about the repetitive cycle! It's also interesting to hear it from the point of view of a make-up artist and the decisions coined to that. As much as I fret over clothes I've never had problems picking makeup or hairstyles that I like.   I guess the cycle of panic = purchase is part of the magic of advertisement in a consumer-driven society, and I'm also a "victim" of that, but I'm rather picky at the same time and don't really shell out  that often, I think about a purchase a lot before making the decision. At the top of my head, I can only remember three/four "big" purchases in the last year; new pair of sneakers, good quality jeans (which I get compliments on!), a really nice leather jacket from my boyfriend, and a bag I bought for myself as a gift after working my butt off as a waitress. It's really good advise to step out of the environment a bit and try to find my own sense of style within myself, so thank you again. :)	labels:	episode_done:True

text:A discussion about ‚Äúknockoff culture‚Äù	labels:I like following the royals and there are so many blogs about dupes for their outfits (repli-kates) that I‚Äôm realizing I‚Äôm a bit blind to this being a bad thing at times because it‚Äôs so normal to see on my socials. I actually just bought a monsoon coat that is pretty much a copy of an Alexander McQueen coat Kate wore   I guess in my head there is no world in which I will ever buy a 10k coat, so buying a cheaper dupe isn‚Äôt taking business away from anyone. I have also bought bespoke clothes on Etsy that are versions of outfits a famous person wore and are advertised as such, in that case I‚Äôm actually supporting a small business but they‚Äôre technically ‚Äústealing‚Äù the idea. So I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs right!  What is the difference between a dupe and a knockoff is an interesting question
text:>dupe and a knockoff is an interesting question  Dupes: Items that are interchangeable from different brands - think lipstick dupes.  Knockoffs: Items made to give a certain look from a specific brand - think Zara, Topshop, Forever21 and H&M products that look like they're from fashion houses.  Replicas: Items made to actually fool others into believing they're authentic items, these items come with tags, labels, dustbags, shopping bags, boxes and other packaging that resemble the actual original designer brand. These products usually involves copying trademarked aspects of the original design.  ETA: In Kate's case, buying coats that are the same cut and color is a dupe, buying a soldout item from Zara that she wore off Taobao is a knockoff.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:What are some habits that keep clothes/shoes new vs that habits that ruin them?	labels:First for cardigans and sweaters is I either go fully wool or fully cotton. Can‚Äôt be any sort of blend, and I avoid mohair. I have a cotton cardigan from urban outfitters that‚Äôs like 5-6 years old and looks brand new, so you don‚Äôt even need to go super pricey, just look at fabric content.  Second is I wash everything on cold, and hang dry as often as possible. Heat basically transforms fabric, so using it is unnecessary. I also find that it sets pit stains instead of removes them.  Shoes I have no idea. I walk a lot and constantly wear out shoes. I find leather with a sewn in sole lasts a lot longer, but flats and heels never last that long. I‚Äôve also had luck with shoes that have wooden soles which I‚Äôve added a sole with traction to.  For bags, I‚Äôve always heard it‚Äôs bad luck to keep them on the ground, but that‚Äôs more superstition than keeping it nice lol.
text:Why cotton in particular? I really like this fabric for other reasons, but is it particularly more resistant than other fabrics? What about blends make them more fragile?	labels:Blends tend to pill more easily not because they‚Äôre fragile, but because the two different fibers can withstand different amounts of tension before they break. Pilling has two parts, the little yarn bits getting worked free from the fabric and tangling themselves into balls as they rub against each other, and the pill actually staying on the sweater and not falling off. With some blends you get the worst of both worlds because the weaker fibers come out and form pills easily, and then the stronger fibers hold onto the pills and keep them stuck tightly onto the sweater. It really depends on the blend, the yarn ply, the stitch, how loose or tight the stitch is, etc etc. lots of factors.	episode_done:True
text:Craig Green Spring 2021 Menswear Collection	labels:Feels like a pretty of a retrospective collection this time around. The collection defining details are all in the small things (neckties, sneakers), while the big things that make the silhouette are refinements of things from past seasons (tents, fisherman hats, even an iteration on the window bags(?) from FW20). The vests look like they could be a reference to the tennis silhouettes from the Bjorn Borg collab Craig did way back when. Still a banger of a collection, though. Nothing wrong with a little comfortable consistency right now.   The Adidas collab is still going hard. Can't wait to see that cast shoe show up on r/malefashion.

text:Discussion: LGBTQIA+ Signaling, Presentation, and Commodification in Fashion	labels:I am so glad this post exists! I‚Äôve been mulling over what queer fashion means to me so much recently. I am a 23F lesbian. I didn‚Äôt really have much of a conscious idea that I was queer until I was a senior in high school, and I was uncomfortably/quietly identifying as bi through most of college‚Äîit‚Äôs pretty recently that I realized I was gay. I went to a historically women‚Äôs college in the south (so, very gay), and I‚Äôm a lifelong urban southerner as well. College changed my life, in terms of queerness‚ÄîThere are so many ways that I began to see queerness as a possibility for the first time because of where I went to school, but presentation and visibility was so much of that formula. I remember meeting one of my best friends in a class when I was a first year and thinking for the first time ‚Äúoh, this person is consciously choosing to show other people that she‚Äôs queer by how she‚Äôs dressed right now.‚Äù She has a pretty dapper, academic butch style, and I had literally never met anyone who dressed like her (or many others on campus, like my butch women‚Äôs studies professor). Through high school and the first bit of college, I think my fashion sense was influenced by a few different somewhat alternative sources (pop punk, tumblr, that twee/ModCloth style that was huge in 2014), but I felt like I dressed in a more muted, watered down version of the aesthetic I really wanted to be, even though I didn‚Äôt know what that aesthetic was yet.   In the middle of college, I broke up with my boyfriend and got cancer, so that was pretty crazy! Having cancer changed my presentation as a queer person pretty radically, considering I went from having long, plain hair to a buzz cut. On my campus, most people didn‚Äôt know I was sick because it was just that common to get a buzz cut randomly, and I both liked and disliked how drastically my visibility as a queer person changed. Now, I prefer having hair that‚Äôs a little more femme (I‚Äôm all good now and my hair is finally in a style I actively enjoy lmao), but for the first time I think I was read as queer when people just saw me.   Before realizing I was gay, I had mostly dated people who are read as masculine/male by the dominant culture. Though some of these were queer relationships, I think that part of me felt like I couldn‚Äôt dress as queer as I wanted to because, when I was dating a man, I felt like he would feel emasculated subconsciously, and when I was dating a non-binary person, both of us had a hard time dressing as queer as we wanted to because we were not as out as we wanted.   Now, I feel like I am finally getting to freely dress, or try dressing, as queer as I‚Äôd like to. To me, a queer vibe has a similar feeling as dressing alternative, or in some way off from dominant culture. I do not identify strongly as butch or femme (though my friends tell me I‚Äôm kind of butchy femme?), but my style is something like artsy/thrifted/vintage/elecectic. I definitely think some parts of dressing queer for me are intentionally mismatched, ugly, or tacky, and I love playing with that. I am definitely influenced by what I see people my age wearing on Tiktok, and before graduating, I was SO influenced by what I saw queer people I looked up to wearing on my campus. For the most part, I don‚Äôt feel oppressed or restricted by what other queer people say looks queer, I usually feel very uplifted by presenting queer in a way that makes me feel allied with other queer people. As an example, recently bandannas have become some thing that feels like a kind of gay look, and it‚Äôs fun and cute to feel like I get to participate in that trend.  One thing I am kind of bothered by is that I feel like I see, especially because I‚Äôve been on Tiktok so much since Covid, I feel like things that I thought were gay tells are starting to be worn a lot more by alternative straight people. I don‚Äôt really consider combat boots, flannels, mom jeans, nose piercings, or dyed hair to be certain indicators of queerness anymore, at least not by themselves, depending on how they‚Äôre styled. I feel like the phrase cultural appropriation is not appropriate here, because that applies to race and culture in a way that I don‚Äôt think it applies to queerness. And I also don‚Äôt think that queer people own certain ‚Äútells‚Äù, and I don‚Äôt really blame straight people for dressing kind of queer as long as they don‚Äôt mind if people read them as queer sometimes. Maybe commodification? I‚Äôm more talking about the way stores repackage queer aesthetics. Like, walk into a forever 21 and a lot of the things that are popular now I would say read pretty gay, or would have read pretty gay to me a few years ago, but they‚Äôre being sold as part of this alternative, ‚Äúcool‚Äù aesthetic. The store however, I would argue, opposes much of what queerness stands for (because I think of queerness as a political commitment to resisting norms in addition to non normative gender or sexuality).   So many thoughts! I think what I‚Äôm trying to say is that I try to dress pretty gay now, and sometimes I feel like I have to dress ever gayer because the things that I see as gay right now are going to be picked up by straight culture next year because they‚Äôre seen as cool and edgy, and then they won‚Äôt be gay tells anymore lol.
text:>I don‚Äôt really consider combat boots, flannels, mom jeans, nose piercings, or dyed hair to be certain indicators of queerness anymore  I'd like to address this one as an old person, lol.  When I was a tween/young teen in the mid-late 70s, flannel shirts were popular (as was wearing men's levis in my peer group but I digress) so I wore the then.  Then they went out of women's mainstream fashion for the 80s, only to come back in the early-mid 90s with the 70s revival and grunge.  I wore them then.  Then they went away from mainstream fashion until, idk?, the mid 2010s?, and so now I have a couple again that I wear occasionally in the early fall or late spring when they're comfortable and appropriate for my climate.  In my eyes, it's not mainstream fashion coopting queer fashion, but rather that every so many years or so, the fashion gods tell us more masculine-coded styles are now in for women again.  Me wearing a flannel now and then when they pop up in the clothing retailers I shop in cause now they're stylish again doesn't have any meaning, whereas to a queer woman my age who may have been wearing flannel shirts consistently for the past 45 years *even when they weren't mainstream fashion*, it might have a vibe and not be, y'know, just a shirt.  Then again, there are non-queer women my age who've been wearing flannels consecutively for the past 45 years just because they're outdoorsy and don't care about fashion and buy all their clothes at LL Bean.  It's just a shirt for them too, so I dunno exactly where I'm going with this.	labels:Sometimes a shirt is just a comfy shirt. :)	episode_done:True

(For example, around my period I just cannot tolerate the gnarlier fragrances--no patchouli, cedar, pine, spices, amber. I only want sweeter, softer scents--lilac, peony, gardenia, rock rose, honey, cream--all of which are scent profiles I don't really care for the rest of the month.) I kind of think sometimes about my outfit when I'm choosing, but my job requires wearing sensible protective clothing and PPE so thinking about the vibe in general would be annoying. Perfume for me is about how I'm feeling more than how I'm looking	episode_done:True
text:advice on how to stop buying clothes I don't need?	labels:On a day that you are not shopping, go through your closet and take inventory of what you have and what you frequently wear. Then think about how often you do laundry and how often you repeat clothes between wears. Come up with a list of how many pieces (and what types of pieces) you ideally need based on that, and stick to it.  For example, if your typical work outfit is some combo of pants and a blouse and you don't rewear anything between washes, and you do laundry once a week but not always on the same day, then 6-7 pairs of work pants and 7-8 work shirts should be enough to give you variety and keep up with laundry. Bonus points if they all mix and match so they can create a wide range of outfits.  Then factor in seasons if you live somewhere with seasons. If you like to layer, in the winter, figure out how many layering pieces you need.  I also think about how often I wear something when I think about what pieces to splurge on, versus what things to get a cheaper version of. I'll buy a higher quality bag or blazer, because a good piece will last for years, and I want something that can take a lot of use and abuse. If I'm wearing something 2-3 times per year for special occasions like holiday parties, it doesn't need to be expensive.  On the clutter front, figure out a system for determining when to let go of a piece. I like to go through my closet as seasons change, phase out anything that's worn out from the previous season, and make sure all of the clothes that I have for the next season still fit, are in good condition, and are things I'm still excited to wear. And if there are clothes that you just don't wear that you feel guilty getting rid of because you haven't worn them enough, or you regret purchasing, take a minute or two and think of why you bought that item and what it is exactly that makes it not work for you. Personally, I found that most of my regret clothes were panic buys for a specific occasion (e.g. "I have  a wedding to go to next weekend and need to buy a dress today" leading to a dress that just isn't my preferred style), clothes that took too much effort to care for (I'm not a dry cleaning kind of gal), or clothes that I loved the idea of but the fit/cut didn't work on my body, so I loved them on the rack but not on myself. Once you figure out the patterns of clothes you regret, you can set rules for yourself to keep you from falling into them.	episode_done:True

In bigger cities like Munich, Stuttgart or Freiburg you also get the student hispter crowd wit skinny jeans, vintage shirts and chucks.  \- middle age people are wild, mostly they look like they were blindfolded while getting dressed. Lots of functional stuff in odd colors, square toes, ill fitting suits, boot cut jeans, etc.  \- from 60 onwards it is mandatory to only wear functional clothes in beige and of course socks + sandals  &#x200B;  Generally, there is a mistrust against well dressed people or people who spend money and care about clothes. This is mostly seen as something a respectable person wouldn't do...
text:Haha this is spot on! I'm half German and I do have to say that I find it very liberating that no one gives a shit compared to Sweden (my other home) where you'll find people in their 40s desperately trying to keep up with fashion.   I've been working in a lot in high end restaurants and you can (almost) always spot the german tourists within a second. I'm sorry, but a white dress shirt won't make your  jack Wolfskin rain jackets and trekking shoes blend in any better (although they're very praktisch).	labels:Haha so true. Another classic are these hiking nylon pants you can unzip to turn them into shorts. And 3/4 shorts in summer are also great.  I lived in South Africa & Australia for some time and it was incredibly easy to spot the Germans. Oddly, I find that there is a weird "sense of fashion" if you can call that.

I have a red lambswool jumper with a high crew neck, which isn't the easiest to wear with shirts but would be okay if it had a high enough collar. Had to have it repaired (didn't notice holes in the factory shop) and the repair was excellent - knew where the holes were and had trouble finding them still. I have a selection of neckties from Drake's which I haven't had a chance to wear yet but they have a nice heft and they feel lovely. I also have a purple 70% cashmere 30% silk scarf which is absolutely wonderful to wear.
text:One thing I really want to highlight with Drake's is that while the value proposition is reduced in terms of the items themselves (e.g. soft shouldered tweed jackets, etc) due to new competitors, Michael Hill's eye for colour is still one of the best in the game. His choice of pattern is amazing too, striking just the right balance between stodgy and kitschy to achieve a real sense of fun and enjoyment out of a more dressed up look.	labels:>striking just the right balance between stodgy and kitschy to achieve a real sense of fun and enjoyment out of a more dressed up look.  Yes! Although sometimes they're not really kitschy so much as straight up awesome. From mythical beasts to big medallions...

I got these in three colors. The fabric is an amazing texture and weight. The colors are so deep and the photos online don‚Äôt do them justice. Maybe will buy a fourth one before they sell out.   Worst: Taylor Stitch Long Haul Jacket in Olive Herringbone. The fabric was really nice, although I would say it‚Äôs brighter green than a typical olive. But the fit was all over the place. The sleeves were too long but the shoulders were too tight, and yet there was somehow too much room in the chest and abdomen. Alas, I returned it.

I think hydrophobic is the name for that type of thing.  There‚Äôs a ton of brands out there that offer this sort of thing but I wanted to get some recommendations.

Looking good out in the wild.  I'm really struggling to understand this [pyjama shirt trend](https://nomanwalksalone.com/media/wysiwyg/FW20LOOKBOOK1/002-a.jpg).

A bit on the pricier side but they actually have tall and super tall (I think) inseams. Their sizing is a bit weird though, I think I went down two sizes from the size I thought I was so I‚Äôd recommend going to a store to try on before buying. Another brand with tall sizing is Banana Republic, I have a pair of jeans I love from there but they are almost too short for me so they may not work for your niece but might for some others!   Lululemon has tall length leggings but again those are pricy. I don‚Äôt usually mind short leggings anymore since 7/8 length has came into style (thank goodness)  Tops and jackets are hardest for me, I haven‚Äôt found a brand that consistently makes long enough arms yet. One trick I‚Äôve found though is that if a top has thumb holes, you can sew those up and it fits like a regular long sleeve!

text:What age did you start pinning down your style? And how many times has it changed since then?	labels:maybe around 7-8 when I was allowed to dress myself and then every year since then??    Just kidding, sort of.  But really I tend to think of my style as like basic+. I don't really have a very interesting or creative style, but I think over time I've learned how to evaluate trend and style elements to determine if they work for me or not.  And this is ever evolving.    In general, I think over time I've gotten better at deciding what I think looks good on me, and what I actually like as opposed to thinking I'm supposed to wear.  I think following trends is fun, but I don't need to reinvent my entire wardrobe with each trend, or wear something that doesn't work for me just because it's popular.  For me there are certain things that have stayed constant, like that I like to add some "edge" element to an outfit.  five years ago this might have been with choker tops, studded accessories, lots of black.  Now it's more leather jackets and chunky shoes.  I tend to overall stay away from things that have a preppy feel, are too frilly, and I just cannot wear kitschy things.  I also realized that while I like skirts and dresses in theory, they are less worn in my closet as compared to jeans and shorts.  As such, I don't need to constantly buy them and just a like 3 per season is more than enough.  Conversely I like to have a wide variety of denim wash and fit options.	episode_done:True

text:How to look elegant without looking old?	labels:It is a good thing you put the links of the instagrammers, because their looks was not what I imagined from the word "elegant".  They are thin and fit, likely with lots of cosmetic surgery and beauty treatments, one is very tall, they are all very "done". It is a look, and everybody do their own thing. Their look is very body conscious, very revealing, very showing off curves (in the right places since they are very thin.. Always explicitly sexy. It is indeed, maybe stereotypical very russian, or eastern european in general.  Some  observations about those looks and if you want to :  - keep shoes all pristine. High heels or sneakers or combat boots, but keep them as  pristine as possible.  - when in doubt, downsize clothes (this is against my regular advice, but this is a specific look).  - usually always showing one of legs/cleavage/midriff.  - very brand aware but you will find similar pieces everywhere starting from primark up...	episode_done:True
text:Review your winter 2020/2021 outerwear: how did your coats and sweaters hold up this season? Would you recommend your specific brand to someone looking for warm layers.

text:I've actually seen a couple people wearing these near where I live. I think they look best when you have an actual collared shirt underneath, it gives you a kind of academic fisherman look. You could probably also stick a thinner turtleneck underneath.  I agree that it looks sloppy if you have a t shirt underneath, not sure if there's a way around that.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Fast Fashion: What are your wardrobe all-stars?	labels:I don't have it any more, but much like your dress #1, I had a dress from Old Navy circa 2003 that was like magic.  It somehow fit when I was 20 lbs up or 20 lbs down.  At some point the lining became wonky on it and peeked out from the over layer and *it looked like it was supposed to do that*.  It was appropriate for many occasions.  I wore it for probably 8 years, spring to mid-fall, some of those years once a week in the summer.  I think I may have paid 20 bucks for it.	episode_done:True
text:Ever been censored at work because of what you wear?	labels:"Can you elaborate on what is political about my attire? I'm confused."     Make them explain their isms and get real uncomfortable. I hope you'll find a way to a better work environment soon.
text:How is feminism not political? It's a movement for cultural, political, and economic change. It has policy demands. Obviously "feminism" is too broad to cover more than the very basics (abortion access, equal pay, etc) but those are still very much political.	labels:It's inherently political, but much like "should pedophilia be kept illegal?" It's a political stance very few peooke want to be seen opposing.	episode_done:True

text:advice on how to stop buying clothes I don't need?	labels:I‚Äôve found that going through my closet regularly, removing clothes that don‚Äôt fit/I don‚Äôt wear has actually stopped me from shopping as much. I get new outfit ideas, re-discover old favourites and bring any clothes that need altering to the tailor‚Äôs.	episode_done:True
text:What did people *actually* wear in 2000's?	labels:I was a teen in the early 2000s. I remember a time of layering an impossible number of different-length camis  under a polo shirt. Also...boleros and shrugs...so many shrugs.

text:Stockings vs Tights vs Leggings	labels:I wear tights under skirts/pants, mostly opaque now though I used to wear some patterned ones.

text:What style rules or clothing attributes are you ruthless about?	labels:No heels - my tendons hate them  Nothing strapless - I tug them up constantly and they look meh on me  Nothing see-through - enough with the poorly made tops!   Nothing that clings to my stomach - fitted can be ok but if I wear something that clings, it's all I can focus on  The rule I break most often and regret (sigh): no more shirts that need ironing!	episode_done:True

I've been googling for ages but have been unable to find answers on reddit or forums (from google results).  1. Is there any easy way to get rid of them or it just a matter of waiting? 2. Are there any economic boxer brief brands that won't cause this as much?

text:How do you care for your expensive/fragile pieces?	labels:Honestly not using the dryer is the best piece of advice (of course being allergic to fabric softener made my decision for me).  I have Forever 21 pieces in my closet that are at least a decade old.  They survived.
text:I do this too for my nicer pieces but there are some made of certain fabric that gets so stiff and no longer soft if you air dry it. Does anyone know how to make these types of fabrics that stiffen up without a dryer soft when they dry? I do admit, I don't use fabric softener when I wash so maybe that can be some help.	labels:I use a shared facility so the dryers are already covered in fabric softener residue (enough to make my skin break out into hives).    Stiffness is not an issue for me.  I'm used to it.	episode_done:True

text:What are you hate wearing?	labels:Anything that is even slightly restricting on my neck (turtlenecks, mocknecks, even some crew necks). Yet, for some absurd reason, I am absolutely drawn to the aesthetic. Its an ridiculous tug of war between fawning over them from afar but ripping them off my body within seconds of having them on.
text:I cannot stand wearing turtlenecks that touch my neck. It‚Äôs like torture.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What are your tips for dressing a big chest!	labels:I would look at some TV actresses with similar body types for cues, as they have a broad wardrobe: Hayley Atwell wore some phenomenal trousers and coats in Agent Peggy Carter, Deborah Ann Woll in Daredevil and for photocalls, Shiv from Succession, and Sarah Rafferty as Donna in Suits come to mind as some slightly varied (but cleaner lined) style archetypes to explore.
text:These are great suggestions, I really struggle to find anyone in the media with my body type to turn to for outfit inspo. I‚Äôll definitely give these a look!	labels:For sure look at Christina Hendricks. She dresses her rack so well! And usually modest but fitted.

text:Psychological & personal reasons for impulse buying	labels:My ADHD is a big factor for me. I have poor impulse control, and I am prone to hyperfocus on "that one thing I want" until I get it. A brain like mine also craves novelty, so I'm never finished shopping and the thing I coveted two months ago is now part of my everyday life. It's a problem.

text:What fashion trend/s have you been obsessed with lately?	labels:Oversized wool coats. I just treated myself to [this coat](https://www.marcellamodanyc.com/products/oversized-wool-coat-1396-2) in black when it was on sale a few weeks ago and it‚Äôs even better in person. It‚Äôs warm and oversized without looking boxy. You can wear the lapel open or button it all the way up. It looks great even when I‚Äôm in yoga pants and new balances, or dressed up.   Also in the WFH quarantine world I‚Äôve been wearing a lot of oversized sweaters with leggings and boot socks pulled up over them.
text:This is my favorite trend too	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What's the greatest length you've gone to obtain a much coveted fashion item?	labels:Before more fashionable brands got into making plus size clothing, Torrid was one of the only places bigger teens could get trendy and/or goth clothes (before they turned into aspiring baby lawyers). Being Canadian, it cost a fortune to order from their online store and I don't even remember if you could return back then, if you could, it definitely wasn't free.  My parents wanted to go fly out to visit my aunt in BC and visit scenic Victoria, so I convinced my mom we should rent a car and go across the border so I could go to Torrid. I tried to sell her on Seattle but she was afraid of driving there, so we settled on Tacoma.   And that's the story of how I ended up spending hundreds of dollars on plus size goth clothes, going to Olive Garden for the first time, and almost dying when my mom tried to make a left hand turn on a busy street to the shittiest hotel I've ever been in.
text:>I tried to sell her on Seattle but she was afraid of driving there, so we settled on Tacoma.   The irony is that while it's probably easier to drive *in* Tacoma, *getting* there on the I-5 is way worse than going to Seattle!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Clarks Released a "Desert Boot 2" - They Look Pretty Nice, What does Everybody Think?	labels:This might be heresy, but I actually prefer the Bushacres over the old and new CDB, having had multiple pairs of both. I originally bought the Bushacre just because they were cheaper, but ultimately came to like it better.   The crepe sole looks nice out of the box, but it just gets dirty and nasty looking IME. Although this one looks a bit darker maybe. I'll have to see it in person.
text:I completely agree. The crepe sole is comfy but gets dirty as fuck after wearing the shoes just a few times.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What's the greatest length you've gone to obtain a much coveted fashion item?	labels:1991, before internet shopping, I was an exchange student in former East Germany shortly after Reunification. I desperately wanted a pair of Doc Martens. On a school trip to Berlin, one of my buddies and I snuck off to the area of the city where most of the punks lived so that I could buy a pair. On the two-hour train ride back, made my other friend smell them to prove they weren't stinky after me wearing them all day lol!   Thanks for posting this. I'd completely forgotten about that trip, and I realized I absolutely need to go track down the (few) photos I have from that day and scan them.

text:What are your go-to basic fall tops? I‚Äôm talking long sleeve tees, sweatshirts, turtlenecks etc!	labels:I‚Äôve recently purchased 4 or 5 pieces from Lou & Grey and they are SO SOFT. One dress was poorly made, but I have a couple shirts that are amazing. I‚Äôm gonna buy a new more this winter.
text:I just bought a long sleeve tee and two short sleeve t-shirt dresses second hand all by Lou&Grey. They are fantastically soft.  I don‚Äôt know what they cost full price, but I found them on Poshmark for about $30 for all three (plus shipping... ugh).	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Show me your fall boots!	labels:After wanting a pair of Doc Martens for years (but not knowing how to fit them into my style), I recently bought these [platform boots with a slight heel](https://www.zappos.com/p/dr-martens-shriver-hi-sanguine/product/9058017). I think they're feminine with an edge.
text:These are my favorite boots ever! It's been less than a year and I've already worn them more than any other shoe I own!   I didn't have to break them in or anything... I literally wore them out of the store and went straight to work (on my feet for 8+ hours). I'm obsessed.	labels:I've been tempted by either the Shriver or Leona but I have some foot issues so I pretty much need to be comfortable from first wear to keep them.  I've been holding off on ordering until I can try them on in a store since I also an unsure of my size.	episode_done:True
text:Can you build a wardrobe off Amazon?	labels:You can. It's not a great place to do it, you'll get better values from other companies, and limiting yourself to just amazon will just not make you look good, but... Focus on fit, start with some basics, return them if they don't fit, and you'll look fine.  Try to avoid polyester.

text:What are some differences between stereotypical Millennial and Gen Z fashion/aesthetics?	labels:Gen Z teens have unlimited access to quality makeup, makeup tutorials, hair tutorials. They can buy any clothing style they want and receive it in the mail tomorrow.  Milennials in their teens had 5 high street stores, Camden market, 3 women's magazines. Then style YouTube exploded when we were in our 20s.
