text:How would you store sentimental clothing?	labels:Safest way is to wrap in acid free paper, store in an acid free box (available at joanns and on line stores).  If you can’t do that, fold it and wrap it in washed, unbleached muslin fabric.   Make sure it is clean before you store it.  Perspiration and food spills can attract pests. If you hang it for display, do not place it in direct sunlight.  Also away from any source of moisture.

text:How would you store sentimental clothing?	labels:I have a fabric storage box that I got from Michaels (probably readily available at any craft/fabric store). The only issue is its kind of odd shaped so finding storage wasn't as easy as just sticking it on a shelf (according to at lrast some sites...when long-term storing clothes, its.better to have fewer folds, so the box is kind of long and skinny? I am not a fabric expert so I'm not sure how true that is).   For random sentimental pieces, I did things like make pillows. I wanted to be reminded of them, but I didn't need it to stay clothing, if that makes sense!	episode_done:True

text:How would you store sentimental clothing?	labels:If you want to be able to look at it, depending on how well it folds up (like if there is a design on the torso that could be arranged on top), you could potentially put it in a shadow box to reduce the amount of wall space it takes up.  You could also get a decorative dress form and display it on that.	episode_done:True

text:How would you store sentimental clothing?	labels:There's a lot of good ideas put forward so far.

text:Sewing your own clothes	labels:Having basic sewing skills to repair or slightly modify existing clothes is a fundamental skill most people should have and is absolutely worth the time. Novice tailoring is a great skill to have too and can save you some money. Beyond that, sewing clothes from scratch is more of a hobby than a necessity for most people, due to the widely available nature of inexpensive and functional clothing. So like most hobbies, whether or not it is "worth the time" (and cost! Sewing is expensive and it's frequently cheaper to just buy an item unless you're looking for a custom fit or something super unique) is more dependent on your enjoyment of the activity than it is on more "functional" motivators like cost-savings.
text:I'm kind of at this level already. This is what saves you money. You can simply buy hand sewing needles and thread for simple repairs.   I'm also learning to make my own clothes, but that is definitely much more expensive than buying them.

text:Sewing your own clothes	labels:Whether it's worth it or not completely depends on what you personally value in your clothes.  Economy? If you just compare any shirt to any shirt, it's often not cheaper to sew it yourself. Fabric is expensive and if you use patterned fabric, you're going to have a lot of scrap pieces due to pattern matching (if that's a priority to you, it's often not a priority in cheaper fast fashion clothes).  Fit, style and comfort wise? If you get good enough at sewing, you can customize the fit of your clothes, choose the fabrics you like, and sew them in a way that you feel is comfortable, without itchy seams, bulk, tight shoulders, excess fabric pouting or whatever.  They're going to be perfect for your taste.  Quality compared to the price? Here sewing your own stuff will definitely be worth it. You can choose a good quality fabric, prewash the fabric to ensure a good fit even after washes, have a proper pattern that suits you perfectly, and then cut the pattern out of fabric that you've pattern and bias matched perfectly, which also means no further twisting after washing. Basically, clever and good pattern matching is going to take the garment from looking 20 bucks to 200 bucks.  There are many more factors to include, like time and labor and interest etc, but basically, if you like it, see it as a hobby that will provide you with clothes that most likely are going to last better than ready made clothes for the same amount of money.

Aside from producing clothes that you want and that fit you, you are developing transferable skills like manual dexterity, decision-making and problem-solving.   Not sure what you mean by lounge clothes, but if you mean clothing made from stretch jersey, you need either a machine that does zig zag stitch or (ideally) an overlocker machine. If you try to sew stretch fabrics with a standard stitch, you will either end up with puckering or a garment that doesn't stretch at the seams, or more likely both. If you have the right machine, it is no harder than sewing woven fabrics once you get the hang of it.

text:I want to eliminate the need for dry cleaning my work wardrobe. Sadly, anything nice seems incompatible with machine wash. What long lasting, work pieces have been easiest for you to maintain?	labels:I require a relatively formal work wardrobe that includes suiting and tailored dresses.  After years of wasting time and money at the dry cleaners, I decided to rationalise my work wardrobe in a similar way to you some time ago.   Some brands, including Emporio Armani, Joseph, Me&Em and Norma Kamali, make very high quality machine washable polyester suiting and dresses that don't look remotely cheap or plastic-y. You can get suiting in machine washable wool from budget-friendly brands including Marks & Spencer and Next, but surprisingly designer brands don't seem to have taken up the opportunity. Wool or cashmere knitwear (any brand) can be machine washed if you invest in a modern machine with a wool setting and a specialist detergent. While deeper coloured cottons will eventually fade, it is otherwise resilient to machine washing and probably the best choice for shirts.  I would avoid silk. Even if it's washable, the colours will eventually fade, and it's hard to remove stains without damaging the fabric.	episode_done:True
text:I want to eliminate the need for dry cleaning my work wardrobe. Sadly, anything nice seems incompatible with machine wash. What long lasting, work pieces have been easiest for you to maintain?	labels:I wear a lot of stuff from Rickis, RW&Co, and INC International Concepts. It's all fairly inexpensive, holds up well, and is machine washable.  "Dry clean only" is almost always a lie though. Clothing manufacturers are required to put care instructions on garments, dry clean only is an easy way for them to avoid responsibility if the garment gets fucked up while being cleaned.   Almost everything with a dry clean only label can be put in the washing machine in a mesh bag. If something seems really delicate (sequins, glitter, delicate mesh) then you can almost certainly hand wash it. Just avoid heat and you should be fine. At this point the only things I would dry clean would be items with sculptural/3d elements that would break down if they got wet.  I thrift most of my clothing, so I'm really daring about putting things in the wash, because if it gets wrecked I'm probably not losing more than $10. I've put dozens of dry clean only items in the washing machine and I don't remember the last time I wrecked something by doing so.	episode_done:True

I have a couple of ways:  1. wearing more often and hanging up between wears to air out and limit wrinkling.  2. Depending upon the item,using an undergarment to protect from sweat etc.  3. Using a steamer to help remove wrinkles and refresh clothes.  4. If having to wash in a machine,gentle cycle on cold and air dry. I use a mesh wash bag for the most delicate articles. I find for a lot of "dry clean only" this method is usually ok.  5. For wools and silks etc. I use Eucalan.   edited to add: I don't really havs brand recs - much of my wardrobe is thrifted and even when I've gotten recognizable brands I don't think I'd be able to say with confidence if they were indicative of the brand's current quality.	episode_done:True
text:I want to eliminate the need for dry cleaning my work wardrobe. Sadly, anything nice seems incompatible with machine wash. What long lasting, work pieces have been easiest for you to maintain?	labels:When I worked in a bank (the most formal setting I've worked in), New York and Company was my staple (their quality has since gone way downhill sadly).  Their dress pants were machine washable and I would typically wear a shirt/cardigan combo.  Their dresses and skirts are also machine washable.    Now I WFH and I could wear PJ pants (or no pants) as long as I look okay on Zoom.  With a few exceptions, my industry is super casual.	episode_done:True
text:Have you ever gone out on a limb and bought clothing from an unknown brand advertised on Instagram/Facebook/online? How did it work out?	labels:Bought a hoodie as a gift for someone. She specifically asked for the one I got; she provided the link and all. It arrived and was a major disappointment. The fabric was thin, the cuts and seams were weird as hell, sleeves were short, and more. It was obvious that it was just a "straight from crappy manufacturer" product with lies on the website. What's unfortunate is that I had a feeling prior to ordering it that it wasn't going to be good. It's just hard to tell someone that they're not good at identifying scam-like products that are all too common nowadays on FB and Insta.	episode_done:True
text:Have you ever gone out on a limb and bought clothing from an unknown brand advertised on Instagram/Facebook/online?

But its been over 2 months and i still havent gotten anything and i was never able to reach customer service!! when i finally did they said “no need for condescending messages we’re just trying to assist you” all i did was say “thanks again! babe!” 😩😩😩	episode_done:True
text:Have you ever gone out on a limb and bought clothing from an unknown brand advertised on Instagram/Facebook/online? How did it work out?	labels:I’ve had decent luck with my targeted ads. I almost use it to my advantage now. If I’m looking for something, I’ll spend 5-10 minutes searching Google and browsing sites - then wait a few days. My Instagram will pop up with lots of places that I wouldn’t have necessarily found off Google but I am their target market.   Then I stalk. Check out the product reviews on their website, do a product review. com check, go into the tagged photos on Instagram to see people who are wearing the product and their feedback. Search comments! Companies not worth shopping with will have complaints under Insta photos or fake responses to their customers. Worse is no response to questions.   You can also find discount codes from their influencers on the tagged photos page that they wouldn’t necessarily share on their main page.   I’m a very cautious buyer. I need to have a good return policy if I’m shopping online from a company. So yes, I have a good experience but I put in a lot of prep into preparing my parachute before I jump.	episode_done:True
text:Have you ever gone out on a limb and bought clothing from an unknown brand advertised on Instagram/Facebook/online? How did it work out?	labels:I bought a skirt from a Pinterest ad that arrived and was constructed out of what appeared to be dollar store plastic-coated table cloths. Another time, I ordered cotton overalls from an Instagram ad and they swiftly fell apart - I wouldn’t even dare to try washing them. Buyer beware!	episode_done:True
text:Have you ever gone out on a limb and bought clothing from an unknown brand advertised on Instagram/Facebook/online? How did it work out?	labels:I casually browse AliExpress when I'm really bored, so I've got a really good eye for catching dropshipped products. This is why the only fast fashion sites I tend to use are SHEIN when their items are on sale. I've only bought 1 full price item from them because it had super good reviews.    Other than that SHEIN is basically dropshipped clothing that I *could* buy from AliExpress, but after shipping fees it would be about the same price and would take a month or more to arrive if it doesn't get flagged in Customs.	episode_done:True
text:Have you ever gone out on a limb and bought clothing from an unknown brand advertised on Instagram/Facebook/online? How did it work out?	labels:I went out on the thinnest limb of hope for Romwe after seeing ads on insta. I saw the cutest blouse and had to have it. Then I went online and was shocked to see the prices and may or may not have gone a little crazy and bought a handful or so pieces. Only until after did I do research and find multiple negative reviews.  Most of the items that arrived were not good quality. But some were acceptable so I kept them. The sandals lasted a little over a year. The blouses I still have and wear. They haven't decreased in quality. Of course, I also take care of them when I wash them. So, it's hit or miss.  But, honestly, I wouldn't purchase from there again. The anxiety that I can't be certain I'm getting what I'm expecting isn't worth it. And the thought that I might've been lucky this time but next time might never receive my order like others.  Rookie shopper move, for sure. I should've known it was good to be true. And, at least for 5 pieces I kept, it has worked out. But if a company cannot guarantee that their products are of an acceptable quality, you have better luck at target, from which I have a few items that are of way better quality. Also, forever 21.  The clothes do last (I know fast fashion is horrible but if you're on a tight budget, you can find pieces that'll last so you're not buying often). I haven't tossed out a single piece and I've owned them for years.	episode_done:True

text:How to find the confidence to wear clothes you like?	labels:Hitting up thrift stores to experiment with new looks is an easy entry point for a lot of people. I'm sorry your mom talked you into returning things you were excited about! That's a bummer.  I try to remind myself that realistically no one will remember what I wore. Or at least they won't spend time thinking about it. If I put together an outfit outside my comfort zone, I can take it off at the end of the day and it's like it never even happened. Same way makeup washes off, clothes come off in an instant too. The stakes aren't as high as they feel.  I used to feel boxed in by what I describe as "school picture day mentality," meaning I felt that every outfit had to be *just right*. It had to represent me perfectly as if that's how I would be preserved in other people's minds forever. But that's so goofy, idk why I thought that. Every day is a new opportunity and every outfit is temporary. I hope you can have fun and tap into your confidence!	episode_done:True
text:How to find the confidence to wear clothes you like?	labels:If you're nervous about the look itself: I used to wear things I was iffy on when I was in a new or different place. Like, if I was worried a dress was too loud and attention-getting for my comfort level, I'd wear it when I was in a different city for the day, because if it did catch too much attention, who cares, I was never seeing these people again! Obviously this is harder to do in covid, because we aren't casually daytripping or traveling, but even just wearing the outfit to the grocery store, where you're probably not going to know everyone, vs wearing it in the office, where you see the same people all the time can ease you into being comfortable...	episode_done:True
text:How to find the confidence to wear clothes you like?	labels:Do you buy with your own income and do you do your own laundry? If yes to both then when your mother points that out again you say “thank you I will take that into consideration” and move on. That’s how adults should talk and the whole point of being adults. You can share your opinion but I don’t have to follow your every word. Then you experiment with light colours yourself. Buying from thrift stores or online second hand apps sounds like a great place to start. Then you can make those calls for yourself or confirm and see if you agree with your mother’s advice	episode_done:True
text:How to find the confidence to wear clothes you like?	labels:Main tip would be to try not to care too much about what others think and do what makes you feel good. I started gaining more confidence when I actually started wearing the clothes I found cute. It was gradual of course and I felt a little self conscious at first but as time went on I felt so much better about myself until I became completely confident in everything I wore. It sucks that your mom discouraged you but I would just say not to mind it and do what you feel like doing. At the end of the day it’s you wearing the clothing- not your mom, and you should feel great wearing whatever you’re wearing! Good luck	episode_done:True
text:How to find the confidence to wear clothes you like?	labels:Maybe for starters not listen to what your mom has to say. I was a tomboy and got girlie in a second when my first skirt turned out pretty. Mom told me I had scrawny legs which was exactly not a nice thing to say at the time. She also made me wear pantyhose with my skirts AND made me pay for them out of my allowance which was a huge bummer because I loved music and had a hard time buying albums as it was.  From then on I learned to do what I wanted to do.	episode_done:True
text:How to find the confidence to wear clothes you like?	labels:Get old!  I'm a Little Old Lady who DNGAF.

Have dressed the same for the last 25 years, since I left a job where I had to wear skirts.	episode_done:True
text:How to find the confidence to wear clothes you like?	labels:Confidence usually comes as a result of doing things. Part of this is trying new things and facing the fact that you might make mistakes; and that's okay, because it's a learning experience. It is not a crime to buy something and realise later it's not for you. Everyone does it.   Some people don't like the idea of making mistakes, so they try and protect themselves and the people they love from them. Sounds like your mother is like that. But at the end of the day, your clothes are for you to wear and wash. Her opinion is just an opinion. The only way you'll know is by wearing the clothes, washing the clothes and seeing how YOU feel about it.	episode_done:True
text:How to find the confidence to wear clothes you like?	labels:Wear them to the grocery store. Wear them on a walk around your neighborhood. Wear them to run errands or to get coffee from a new place.   The ultimate advice is to not care what other people think of your clothes, but that's just a lot easier said than done, especially when people you know are giving their unsolicited opinions. So wear them in spaces where you're not interacting with people or, at least, not with people whose opinions on your clothes matter to you. See what it feels like to be out in the world dressed how you want to be dressed and go from there.	episode_done:True
text:How to find the confidence to wear clothes you like?	labels:For light colored clothes:  - Persil laundry detergent. It’s gotten stains out of things that I never thought possible - Keep a few Clorox wipes or a tide pen in your bag for random spots that may occur  - Carry a scarf in your bag to sit on, I always do regardless of what color my pants are  With new clothes, I’ll wear them around the house for a bit to get comfortable in them & make any adjustments to the outfit. IMO it’s a great time to listen to music, maybe have a drink/tea, relax, and enjoy the process. Invoke the feeling of getting ready for a Friday night out with your best friends.   Then it’s time to for the outside world. My lizard brain chose these beautiful clothes, it’s time to embrace them.

text:What did you teach your mom about fashion?	labels:My mom died years ago, but I wish I could have taught her how to do makeup. Liquid eyeliner is a PITA and her attempts needed help. I miss her so much.   She taught me to always try it on, you don’t know if something that looks like a sack on the hanger may fit your perfectly.   She wore sweats all of the time, but her pale skin, dark hair and icy blue eyes looked amazing with cobalt blue. I should have encouraged her to wear that color more.	episode_done:True
text:What did you teach your mom about fashion?	labels:I taught my mom to have a little more fun, and to spoil herself. My mom has great style, but we live in the Midwest and looking at older photos of her I know later took on a sort of “mom” approach to style-to put it nicely, she likes good clothes, but appreciates them on other people. I have lots of photos of her in the 80s with amazing hats, gloves, and other things that had so much presence. I work in fashion so my goal is always to nudge her a bit so that she can feel like the center of attention, but not so far as to make her uncomfortable. This means buying nice and ornate little accessories for her, or introducing her to trends she might not know are age appropriate and easy to find at a good price. Last year I got her a 3/4 length sleeve top in navy from Jcrew with little ostrich feathers on the sleeves, and it was understated enough that it allowed her to feel like a celebrity wearing it, and it seemed to suit her. It BLEW HER MIND! This year she asked for a red clutch, and was afraid it was too specific. I promised that I would search high and low to find something perfect. There is literally no place I won’t go to find something specific if she wants it, and I often know where to look and have my eyes open all year long. I want her to feel special because she is the only reason that I do.	episode_done:True
text:What did you teach your mom about fashion?	labels:I helped teach my mom self love! She grew up without a mom (fuck cancer) and always struggled with depression, eating disorders, and self esteem. When I was growing up she tried but didn’t know how to teach me to have self confidence, and I picked up a lot of her insecurities. She eventually encouraged me to go to therapy (for other reasons) and I helped pass on a lot of the tools I learned for self love. My entire childhood she almost exclusively wore my father’s clothes, who was much larger than her, so none of the clothes fit and she never picked them out for herself. She still doesn’t care too much for fashion but she now buys clothes for herself that make her feel good, instead of just wearing clothes to be clothed.	episode_done:True
text:What did you teach your mom about fashion?	labels:It's a little thing, but the French tuck. I started doing it one day, and then I noticed she was doing it, too, a few weeks later. It was a fun detail to notice since I copy her so often (even at 28 y.o.)!	episode_done:True
text:What did you teach your mom about fashion?	labels:How to mix and match pieces. My mom finds a combination that works (often because it is the store display) and just does that. She'll "mix it up" by buying the exact same thing in several different colors, but she will still pair them with the same item. So, like red shirt and blue pants and the same shirt and pant but in green and brown, but wearing the blue pants and green top would probably not occur to her. Which is very uniform and fine, but she was complaining about how she has two closets of clothes and looks the same all the time...the first time I took a skirt and paired it with a different shirt than the one she always pairs it with, it was like she thought I was a magician. She also still has some matching-print tops and bottoms from the late 80s/early 90s and breaking the pair up (like, wearing the patterned skirt with a solid top) made them look fresh and new...But she is also the type of person who doesn't ever rearrange furniture on her own and rarely tries new recipes either. She just is good with sticking with things that she knows will do well enough.    But yeah. Shopping her own closet for new combinations was a lightbulb moment for her. (My grandmother is the same way. She literally hangs her outfits on the same hanger, so *those* pants go with *that* sweater, which is how she ended up with, no joke, 47 pairs of white pants at one point 😬)	episode_done:True

She was beautiful in middle age but had no income for clothes and stuff as she was a stay at home mom. She did however teach us a lot about femininity and hygiene and hair and makeup. I didn’t realize how much she had taught me until recently. As a preteen I watched a lot of What Not to Wear so I thought I had become a fashion expert (even if i only got one new outfit per year and it was an embarrassing monkey character T-shirt 🤣) anyhow I always tried to give her fashion advice to make her feel better about herself and in hindsight she shouldn’t have listened to my tip to buy green seersucker capris 😂 she died when I was 17 but if I could, I would treat her to all the nice stuff I can now afford to buy for myself 🥰	episode_done:True

text:What did you teach your mom about fashion?	labels:My mom liked the makeup I wore for our family Xmas photo so she said next time she wants me to do her makeup too (she doesn't wear makeup anymore). I hope we'll get a chance to do that one day.   Back when she was working, I did help her pick some clothes and shoes so it was always flattering when her coworkers thought something she wore was 'cool'. She does ask me for style advice so I'm flattered she trusts me. I learned a lot about clothes and makeup on my own but as I get older I definitely find myself going for cozy pieces that are like a step away from what my mom would wear lol.	episode_done:True
text:What age did you start pinning down your style? And how many times has it changed since then?	labels:Changes all the time. I’m 36. Thought I was preppy a couple years ago. Athletic before that.

text:What age did you start pinning down your style? And how many times has it changed since then?	labels:My fashion is evolving! I was raised in a strict conservative homeschooling environment, so until college my fashion was nonexistent.  In college, I had the same instincts for fashion I do now— but no taste. Meaning I knew the message I wanted to send but didn’t have the language down.  It took me five years, and several kind friends in grad school. I used the Curated Closet, lurked on this sub, and- I know it sounds weird- watched RuPaul’s Drag Race with a very fashion-forward friend.  I have three key “styles” and rotate based context: 1. Business casual— lots of black leggings and Uniqlo swing dresses, blazers, button-ups, minimalist sweaters. Clothing that says Take Me Seriously, I’m Here to Work. 2. Flannels and nerdy or artsy graphic tees. Laid-back mode.  3. Artsy, edgy, fashion-forward. I like the subversive and truly odd. As a confused baby in undergrad, this love combined with poverty drove me to a series of failed experiments. Notable: the notorious black sequin dress and top hat, a vintage 20s button up with poofy sleeves paired with high waisted jeans, camo jacket and flowy skirt. Now, my artsy style manifests in outfits like: Universal Standard Geneva dress, green bomber jacket, cherry Doc Martens and matching lipstick, dangling silver figure earrings, statement bag. (I’m currently in love with FashionBrandCompany’s garbage bag purse).   I put a lot of thought into my wardrobe and 75% are pieces that can rotate through all three. Black leggings and black dresses are great neutral canvases— the accessories make the style!	episode_done:True
text:What age did you start pinning down your style? And how many times has it changed since then?	labels:I work in an office and am supposed to dress business casual.   My entire closet is work clothes and while some of it is cute it’s mostly boring and safe.   I feel like my personal style is edgy and fun. I’m working on curating a weekend wardrobe and not focusing on work outfits until I have just as much weekend  and after work clothes. I’m thinking fun  Art teacher and also colorful mom clothes but we will see I also like basics a lot like jeans and a black top .
text:I love the idea of a weekend wardrobe! I work in an office where everybody is super casual (jeans and T-shirts) that whenever I dress up (wear a cute dress or even mini skirt + stockings in the winter), I get asked if I have plans after work or I end up feeling overdressed. So even if I do feel good when I leave the house, I feel super conscious by the time I get to the office. A weekend wardrobe sounds like a good plan!	labels:I was in the exact same situation as you a couple years ago! When I first started wearing cute clothes to work I def felt self conscious. I'm sure I got a lot of "why the heck is she so dressed up" stares. But I kept dressing cute and eventually people were like oh that's just how she dresses - i.e. you just gotta own it. (I did start slow though, so like I worked my way up from casual to minor upgrades to clothes to more cutesy looks)  Disclaimer: everybody's situation is different and this might not work for you. I'm just sharing what worked for me. :)	episode_done:True
text:What age did you start pinning down your style? And how many times has it changed since then?	labels:I'm 65, retired.  Have dressed pretty much the same (not the same items!) for 25 years, ie jeans/cargoes/tees/denim shirts/hoodies. Prior to that I was in a job where I had to wear skirts, I wore collared tees/shirts, jumpers and cardies with them.  That takes me back to 1981.  Before that, too long ago to remember but certainly not "business wear", and before that when at uni/college/school, I guess the then equivalent of what I wear today.  Well school was uniform, I meant time not in school.	episode_done:True
text:What age did you start pinning down your style? And how many times has it changed since then?	labels:I work in an office and am supposed to dress business casual.   My entire closet is work clothes and while some of it is cute it’s mostly boring and safe.   I feel like my personal style is edgy and fun. I’m working on curating a weekend wardrobe and not focusing on work outfits until I have just as much weekend  and after work clothes. I’m thinking fun  Art teacher and also colorful mom clothes but we will see I also like basics a lot like jeans and a black top .
text:I love the idea of a weekend wardrobe! I work in an office where everybody is super casual (jeans and T-shirts) that whenever I dress up (wear a cute dress or even mini skirt + stockings in the winter), I get asked if I have plans after work or I end up feeling overdressed. So even if I do feel good when I leave the house, I feel super conscious by the time I get to the office. A weekend wardrobe sounds like a good plan!	labels:Thank you. I feel like a lot of my years of shopping for work clothes was just me surviving and not really being too fashion forward or myself  but now that I have a little bit more heads space and time to think about what I wanna wear outside of work I am really excited about creating a great wardrobe. That being said if you have a lot of cute pieces that you want to wear to work it would be Cool challenge to set for yourself to see if you can find a good middle ground  to use some of your nice pieces for work while still keeping it business casual. But yeah I do wish that in the past years I had spent more time on outside of work wear, I feel like having multiple interests and hobbies outside of work is super important and my wardrobe wasn’t reflecting that	episode_done:True

I'm in a super male dominated environment for both my jobs and my style is very Ms. Frizzle-esque.   One of my jobs is uniformed, other isn't. The former, I go absolutely nuts and colourful on my makeup (legit will wear glitter and draw designs with eyeliner if I'm feeling in the mood for it) and the latter meant I was more dressed up than about 98% of the staff (there was one cashier who was like me, she DGAF what people thought and would wear jewel tone velvet shirts and leather pants and studded boots when everyone else was in jeans and t shirts. She looked awesome. )     After about a week, people stopped asking questions.	episode_done:True
text:What age did you start pinning down your style? And how many times has it changed since then?	labels:I had a school uniform til 17 and truly wore the most random clothing until I was done university. I never thought of the clothes I owned as a whole, and instead just picked up whatever piece of clothing caught my little magpie eye.   When I was about 23 I started looking at my clothes a bit more strategically in terms of “outfits” rather than “items” as in, if I want to have these cool funky pants then maybe I need to have a simple black shirt to go with it. When I started I definitely got sucked into the “essentials in every wardrobe” lists but in the last two years (since I was 24!!) or so I have learned stopped using those as a template for my own closet.   It also helped that I became a bit more confident in myself — I used to just want to blend in and be unnoticed and that showed in my wardrobe, but now I am happy to be wearing something a little more out there. I have always loved the ripped jeans, all black, big stompy boots look, but where I grew up was so not a big stompy boots country that you couldn’t even find items like that back in my day. Now that I’m older I’m more confident in wearing those kinds of items.    Since that is my main style I don’t vary too much from it, but I have been enjoying working on little “mini capsules” of items that are a style I like to delve into occasionally, such as a cowboy/cottagey look or just looking like a disco ball. I have a very narrow colour palette of 3 colours so  as long as my mini capsule items are the same three colours I can wear them head to toe for eg a full cottagey look, or I can just wear my peasant blouse and black jeans to tone it down. :)	episode_done:True
text:What age did you start pinning down your style? And how many times has it changed since then?	labels:I had a general style from a relatively young age, like teenage years. Kind of preppy, kind of quirky, lots of animals on my tops, lots of jewel tones, etc. I'd play around with buying other types of looks, but most of them left my closet pretty quickly. In my early/mid 20s, I did have this horrible period where I thought I needed to "grow up" so I purged a *ton* of stuff and thought I was just going to stick to neutrals and sleek lines and be very polished, or my idea of polished...I was miserable and by the time I was in my late 20s, began rebuilding my wardrobe to be filled with more things that just make me smile. I do have some of my neutrals hanging around. I learned I don't hate them, as long as they have texture or dramatic sleeves or things like that. So I guess the experience wasn't a total wash...  But yeah, I'm 31 and my style journey is just kind of ending up where I was at like 3. (I mean, I just bought a sweater of a giraffe, haha) But it was really about just kind of accepting who I am and realizing I'm probably not going to outgrow a lot the idiosyncrasies the way I thought I "should" 🤷‍♀️	episode_done:True
text:What age did you start pinning down your style? And how many times has it changed since then?	labels:I experimented with a lot of different styles over the years but I think I really settled into my style at around 23 years old. I’m 28 now and still dress the same, which may not seem that long but before I was changing pretty dramatically on a yearly basis. I think it just came with age and getting to know myself better. Before I was always chasing trends and trying to dress for others, but as of 23 I started to dress for myself and stopped caring if something was in fashion or not. It led me to discovering pieces and styles that I really loved, that also suit my lifestyle, which hasn’t changed too much over the years (living in a big city and working at an office that allows for casual dress).	episode_done:True
text:What age did you start pinning down your style? And how many times has it changed since then?	labels:I was gonna say now, but I actually I had a pretty good idea of what I liked around 16.  I was low key obsessed with J-fashion, specifically Gothic Lolita, most my friends were all emo/alt, as was I, and I was reading a lot of Vogue, so I had good trend awareness, and balancing all those things to make outfits that worked was a lot of fun.  I had two distinct phases after that.  The first was that kind of aggressively flattering/appropriate style that a lot of people develop in their early twenties, which was a compliment magnet, and was also a lot of fun.  After that I had a phase that wasn't really so much a style as it was having a retail job and no strong preferences.  I wore some fun items, but there wasn't much cohesion, and it eventually made getting dressed feel like a chore.  I got tired of that in 2019, did the big chop, started my closet overhaul, and pretty much got down to writing myself a rule book, since I knew what I liked and wouldn't get sick of wearing. (Also, I tend to forget anything not written down.)  Turns out, most of that was based on what I liked in high school, and the handful of things that stuck since then adapted to my life now.  I genuinely like black, and am fine with only a handful of other colours I can wear head to toe.  I like a simple, compliment magnet of a shoe.  I enjoy a fun print or a ridiculous statement item- just in a limited colour palette.  I had my exploratory phase and didn't particularly care for it, so outside of life changes or new fashion loves, I don't see any drastic changes in my future.	episode_done:True
text:Changing your mindset from fast fashion to one of investment pieces. What did you learn?	labels:One of the big things I learned is that there's a lot less room for error or experimentation with investments. I feel pretty fortunate that I had a pretty good idea of what I liked and didn't like, but I think if you're still wanting to experiment then it may be best to stick with very specific investments. For example, I started just with shoes (I have strong preferences) and outerwear (I wanted to upgrade shapes/colors I already loved). That'll help build confidence in moving to other areas.
text:This is a good point. I started by replacing things I wore all the time with better quality versions. I also started with shoes	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Changing your mindset from fast fashion to one of investment pieces. What did you learn?	labels:My new year's resolution is to only buy (at most) one new piece of clothing per month. I have a pretty well-stocked closet, but I also don't love most of my clothes. I did too much stress shopping because of Covid, and spent more money than I needed to on mostly cheaper clothes, and I made this resolution to help change my mindset about shopping.  With my resolution, I'm not even looking at outlets of other cheaper stores. Yes, it is still hard to stomach spending more money on clothes, but after I've had an item in my cart for a couple days and feel certain that it's the one new thing I want to get for the month, it has been easier for me. It  has also forced me to be much more thoughtful about what I need. We'll see how the rest of the year goes!  I think that thrifting can (obviously) be great, but it can be a lot easier to buy things that you don't love because they are great pieces that just don't work for you.	episode_done:True
text:Changing your mindset from fast fashion to one of investment pieces. What did you learn?	labels:It sounds like you're having trouble staying motivated so maybe you need to remember why you wanted to change your habits in the first place - you mentioned that you wanted to reinvent yourself.  For me, it took years and it's an ongoing process to change the way I think/buy, as well as to save up ad afford the nicer things I wanted. I would say that some main factors for me to change were that I became dissatisfied with the quality I saw (once you learn to sew, you can't unsee it), and I had a friend who was starting to buy nicer things. She made more money than I did, so it took more effort for me when I wanted to buy some, too.  I had to learn to do my research - follow the brands/makers, see what sales and discounts they offered, if any. It might take a season or easily longer to learn about their habits before I made my move. I also had to learn about when to just buy something full-price - if I thought I would be so disappointed to miss out, I'd consider buying the piece sooner. I wear a XS-S most of the time, so these sizes tend to sell out faster. Most of the time though, I had to learn to be patient, be honest with my style/needs, and shop smarter.	episode_done:True
text:Changing your mindset from fast fashion to one of investment pieces. What did you learn?	labels:Having gone through this transition, the main advice I would give you is to understand the categories and "slots" in your wardrobe before you shop for pieces, and if you have an item-type you like while you wish the piece were better in a particular way, upgrade that piece specifically, and take your time doing so.  For example: I learned I love well-fitted, thin turtlenecks with structured trousers and skirts, so now I feel secure shopping for high-end turtlenecks. But I also know I only have 4 "slots" in my closet for these - one black, one gray, one taupe/camel, one cream - so that's all I need, forever, and I can upgrade one piece at a time. I'm giving myself permission to wear the same things all the time, like a cartoon character, while I do so. :)	episode_done:True
text:Changing your mindset from fast fashion to one of investment pieces. What did you learn?	labels:My experience with this is to upgrade pieces that I can use multiple times and that are essential. Purses, shoes, coats, jeans, sweaters. Then once those are in place then we move to smaller items — tops for each season, dress pants, etc. best of luck !	episode_done:True
text:Changing your mindset from fast fashion to one of investment pieces. What did you learn?	labels:Going through the same thing right now - same age range and a student as well :) Honestly, COVID has helped my mindset a lot. I'm not wearing real clothes as much anymore, as I mostly live in PJs and sweatpants, so I'm re-evaluating why I have so many fast fashion pieces in the first place. Do I really need ten pairs of cheap jeans? No, and I don't even like wearing most of them anyways. There's a thrill of buying things on sale "just because," but after that fades, I'm left with a piece of clothing that I don't really **love**. So I just gravitate towards the same few pieces that I really **do** love, and I realized that I should just invest in a few quality things that I'll always go for.  Donating and selling a ton of my old clothes over the past few months has really helped me settle into a more minimalistic mindset. I also think about the ethical and environmental impacts of fast fashion a lot more nowadays, which really puts me off from buying things online from cheap sites. Thrifting is also a great way to save some money and be more sustainable while still getting quality pieces!	episode_done:True

text:Changing your mindset from fast fashion to one of investment pieces. What did you learn?	labels:You can find quality items + tailoring for less than $200. Make sure to read what expensive clothes are made out of - just because a shirt costs $200 doesn’t mean it’s good quality. You can also thrift good quality vintage clothing for less than $20.   I bought a blazer almost 5 years ago for around $150, tailored it, and it fits perfectly to this day. Pair that with a white 100% cotton t-shirt from The Gap ($15 max) and a real gold necklace ($$$$$) and you have yourself a business casual outfit for work. My dress pants and jeans are also all tailored.   I would say statement pieces - jewelry, shoes, bags - look cheap if they actually are cheap. Invest in quality leather shoes, an expensive watch, and gold/silver jewelry. I find that some tops and jeans from Forever 21 and Zara don’t look cheap if you tailor them and know how to style them. However if you buy cheap $20 shoes and a $5 fake gold necklace, an expert eye can tell and you’ll look quite tacky.   Just my 5 cents!  ETA: you don’t need to buy $200 items of clothing, but you also can’t buy $10 clothing. You need to find something in the middle. Don’t shop at stores like  Primark, but you can still find a decent blazer or pair of dress pants at Zara or H&M. My personal favourite for work clothes is Banana Republic. Their dress pants are less than $80 and they frequently go on sale. However, do NOT buy statement pieces at these stores as I mentioned before.	episode_done:True
text:Changing your mindset from fast fashion to one of investment pieces. What did you learn?	labels:Once, very soon after starting my job, I bought some pants that didn't fit super well but I liked the color. I asked my friend, a lawyer and the best dressed woman I have ever met, whether I should keep or return the pants. She said the material wasn't great and the color wasn't going to wash well. She also said something that was a revelation and really stuck with me, "I'd hate for you to wear something that is beneath you." Until then, I'd never had the thought that I could be "above" certain clothes, but attaining a certain level of maturity and professional success did mean I should have higher standards. My parents never taught me anything about clothes and I wasn't discerning about quality till I'd owned and spent time in good quality stuff. When I compare old and new clothes side by side I see a big difference in the material, stitching, and cut. I don't think of them as investment pieces--to me, that's just a euphemism for expensive clothing, because I wore my fast fashion clothes for years too not months. The new mindset I have is that enjoying expensive clothing is fine. I'm not "undeserving". I'm allowed to pay attention to my appearance and spend resources on looking my best.	episode_done:True
text:Changing your mindset from fast fashion to one of investment pieces. What did you learn?	labels:I have no idea if this is a good idea but it’s what I’m trying out. I transitioned to thrifting and focused on “vintage” aka <2020 clothes in natural fibers to find my style. Now I feel like I can recognize quality clothes, which cured me of any desire to shop crappy fast fashion. Now if only I could break my thrifting addiction...that would be the last step on the road to a small, high quality wardrobe.	episode_done:True

text:can you tell me the major difference b/w style and fashion?!	labels:Fashion is collective, is what's trendy. Style is personal. Sometimes the 2 overlap but most times people with style are wearing items that are not considered in fashion.   For example a celebrity has a distinct style (eg Billy Eilish). If everyone started dressing like her, then it will be in fashion.	episode_done:True
text:can you tell me the major difference b/w style and fashion?!	labels:One of my favorite quotes is by Coco Chanel: "Etiquette are for those without manners, in the same way as fashion is for those without style."  What this means to me is that fashion is a series of "rules" and transient ideas about what "good style" is, but isn't really a substitute for having your own well-defined, more solid and long-lasting style.	episode_done:True
text:Looking for aesthetically pleasing pajamas	labels:I will put in a rave review for Recliner pajamas. I now own way too many sets to mention, as I've been slowly replacing all my pj's with this brand.   I have the second skin nightgown which is a midi length nightdress that is super flattering, yes you could call it sexy (my husband does). I also love the PJ set long sleeve version.   Not silk, not gauze, but infinitely washable -- my very first purchase is 4 or 5 years old now and I've washed it every week and it still looks brand new, no piling, no stretching, no fading. It holds up to its claim and you can wear over and over again without getting stanky. I say this as someone who's been wearing this brand since I was perimenopausal and had hot flashes.   The second skin nightie is cut in a way that is super flattering--- but so are the Pj's which i am basically living in since COVID. I just sleep too hot so the PJ's are for day and the nightie is for night.  I did give the Lilly Silk Pj's a try but they don't stretch at all and just weren't as flattering or as comfortable.  I tried Lunya as well but I'm 5'0 and they were designed for very slim and tall people.	episode_done:True

text:How do your clothes wear out?	labels:For me, it’s typically the elasticity of fabrics start to give and the items no longer fit correctly or if it’s a bottom, they no longer “stay up”. This usually happens with leggings or panties after about 5 or more years of regular wear with caring for the items properly.  I also had a faux leather jacket wear out after 6 years of regular wear. The faux leather ended up “peeling off” or something like that.
text:This reminds me of these cheap leather boots I had. I had them for years but always forgot about them and one day I needed something to match an outfit for an event and the boots came to mind. Wrong move... The leather looked okay but once they creased and stretched while walking, the whole thing started peeling off. Thankfully, it was dark at the event and even if somebody noticed, nobody said anything... The boots ended up giving me permanent injury on a specific spot on my foot afterwards bc they turned out to be very painful to walk in, though.	labels:	episode_done:True

This should be enough, but if stains do start to appear, use The Laundress Stain Bar (which contains borax) as a pre-wash spot remover. This regime won't work on old stains, but it will work on preventing any new stains.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:How does one incorporate haute couture into everyday work outfits?	labels:My advice when incorporating an element that's "off" from the norm is to add another element in the same vein to balance it out and make it look more intentional. By "element" I'm including accessories and hairstyles, makeup. So you could pair a couture blazer with a blowout, or a dramatic blouse with a bold lip, or an iconic skirt with a high end bracelet. Also, outerwear is a great place to start if you're tentative bc you take it off once you get to work. Coats, jackets, bags, scarves.	episode_done:True
text:How does one incorporate haute couture into everyday work outfits?	labels:real haute couture should be treated as an art piece, first of all if you can afford to buy a piece of haute couture chances are that you not only need the money to afford it but also the power and most pieces are only made for events such as the oscars. if even that you still have the money and the influence in the fashion industry to be able to have haute couture in your closet, I wouldn't wear it for work tbh appreciate it	episode_done:True
text:How does one incorporate haute couture into everyday work outfits?	labels:I don't own anything that's truly haute couture, but I'm sort of a collector of independent, higher-end fashion. I'm a stay at home mom right now, but I LOVE the idea of mixing high and low pieces together. I also think there's nothing wrong with just going all out and letting a piece shine. I have actually displayed fashion pieces that I love in my home, especially when I can't wear them on a daily basis.  I have a beloved Rachel Comey wool purse with a drawing of a nude woman on it, and I display it on a mannequin in my bedroom, so I can see it everyday. One day, I'll carry it to the store, lol. I also have a Suno NY skirt that is way too small for me, but I bought because I loved the fabric pattern. I've draped it over a shelf or used it as a pillow cover to display it where I could see it.	episode_done:True
text:How does one incorporate haute couture into everyday work outfits?	labels:More info needed: What luxury designer* pieces do you tend to fall in love with? If evening wear or voluminous skirts are what makes your heart beat faster, there might not really be a good way of bringing that into your 9-5... but if you’re drawn to something like Balmain blazers (a personal weakness), it’s a lot easier to just throw one of these into your work rotation in place of a “normal” blazer. If you’re into a particular brand’s prints, textures, use of color, etc., then accessories are an easy place to start as well - a full blown Pucci dress may be a bit “too loud” for an engineering firm, but you should be able to get away with a silk Pucci scarf.   *Assuming you meant fashion house runway / main line pieces, not true haute couture which is really not work-appropriate unless you’re a model or actual royalty...	episode_done:True
text:How does one incorporate haute couture into everyday work outfits?	labels:Depends on what kinda of styles you mean and also what your work dress code is, but tbh you’ll likely stand out.

text:F21 and CR are terrible. Shein isn't even as good as *them.*	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Thoughts on Shein?	labels:As others have said, it's very unethical (but I think most places are at this point) and extremely hit-or-miss. But it can be much more cost-effective than similar places like Forever 21. You need to look at the reviews to make  sure you're getting a decent quality item, and even then the sizing is inconsistent, so be prepared to give some items to a friend when they don't fit. I would absolutely not purchase anything that doesn't have a lot of reviews since a lot of things they carry seem to be straight garbage.	episode_done:True
text:Thoughts on Shein?	labels:Don’t buy from there if you want clothes that last any longer than 4 months. It’s terrible for the environment and they have child labor as the reason they’re so cheap.  That being said, I know it’s a puller because a lot of people cannot afford the cost of clothes that are visually high fashion and shien is appealing for it’s low price. If you can afford to buy better and more expensive clothing, do so. It’s worth the price in the long run, and you won’t be helping this scummy company.  If you cannot afford higher, then I understand buying from shien, but recognize that they are a terrible company and see if you can find any good thrift stores or online resellers that may be around the same price range for a much more ethical choice.

Let’s have some empathy for a moment: it is an absolute privilege to be able to shop at a sustainable store and/or to be able to buy secondhand. Imagine being someone who hasn’t bought new to them clothing in years because they can’t afford to and then fast fashion prices are waved in their faces on clothing that fits them and is their style. I’m not going to tell someone to not buy clothing from a place they can afford. I’m absolutely not doing it.   People demonize fast fashion because they look at it as black and white and don’t understand that, if you’re shopping at SHEIN, you likely can’t afford the more sustainable sources/you can’t find what you’re looking for secondhand. I’m plus sized. I can’t fit into and afford a lot of the sustainable brands out there. And, people buy out the “fashionable” plus size items in my local thrift stores to sell on Depop, so, I don’t blame people for shopping on SHEIN.  I’ve bought SHEIN secondhand and I’ve had items for years and I haven’t had any issues. I haven’t bought first hand from them in a long time but when I did, I never had any long shipping times or anything, either. I found the same defects I’d find at Target, like, a long thread here or there that I can easily snip off.   This goes for fast fashion in general—if you take care of your clothes and wear the appropriate size, you can make them last. It’s not like they spontaneously rip apart, you have to do something to make them do that. Steam your clothes to get out wrinkle. Tumble dry, hand wash, etc.
text:I would agree. I already commented but there's a huge market gap for plus sized women that Shein fills. It's beyond obvious most people posting and commenting on this sub aren't plus sized or are on the smaller end of it like me, size 14/16. Shein accommodates women up to size 24/26 or so and those women are more likely to need inexpensive clothes (obesity/poverty correlation, it sucks but its true). Most people on this sub can afford or have the option of a huge variety of ethical and sustainable clothes that are not Shein either due to being straight sized or having enough disposable income. If you're committed to ethical and sustainable fashion and you're avoiding all new clothes, fast fashion, and mall brands, sure, I'll listen to your critique of Shein, but please realize most American women don't really have that privilege. If you're out here buying Zara and Express, you can kindly shut the fuck up with your hypocrisy.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:My thoughts as this came up in another thread: SHEIN is mostly dropshipped, but if you *only* buy SHEIN clothes on sale you're often getting it at the same price as what it sells for on AliExpress without paying a lot for shipping *and* you don't have to wait a month or more for it to arrive from China.    I've ordered from both AE and SHEIN and tbh getting everything in one package in a week vs 10 packages that may or may not show up between 1-2 months after the order date is one thing that SHEIN does right.     Do I think it's a good company? No. But I'm a broke bitch who can't afford nice staple pieces, esp with my weight fluctuating so much due to covid and being depresso.	labels:	episode_done:True

What about the people who are being paid 40p a day in sweltering and unsafe Bangladeshi factories? Factories that are dumping toxic dyes into water sources? We all have a responsibility not to perpetuate the monolithic success of these horrible fast fashion conglomerates.  What gets me about it is that there's a pretty big luxury component to fashion. Clothes are a necessity, but how much do we NEED? Are we really so entitled to large wardrobes and constant output of new stuff?  Of course, the people buying the most stuff aren't poor folks, and without fast fashion some people would legit struggle to have the clothes they need. But I don't like hearing the "what about poor people" argument being used to dismiss the issues entirely. I buy cheap shoes when it's all I can afford... But that doesn't change the fact that people suffered for those cheap shoes to be available to me. It's just a difficult thing to reconcile, because either way, someone suffers.  I certainly don't judge anyone who buys fast fashion, I'd be a hypocrite if I did. I just don't think the issues should be dismissed.	episode_done:True

As people have gotten away from covering them as a rule, that's opened up a lot of new styles.

text:Hats - discussion	labels:I don't know anything about "hat energy" but I know that hats, like hair, look best when they're shaped, colored, and styled in a way that suits your face and outfit.  The bolder the hat, the more obvious it may be if you don't know what you're doing, but even with a more understated hat, a clumsy choice is going to be pretty obvious.  I mean, it's *on top of your head.*  I wear a lot of hats and I've been told I wear them well, but I dress in vintage style so I have outfits that are made to be worn with hats, a pretty good frame of reference in terms which hats to wear with which outfits.  More recent maintstream fashion is really not styled to be worn with hats, so fitting a hat in there requires a bit of crafty innovation, and it probably requires reducing your range of hats to the most basic casuals; floppy sunhats, berets, cabbies, beanies and baseball caps.  Each of those styles has an existing set of visual conventions:  While you don't necessarily *need* the whole tweed jacket and oxford shoe getup to pull off a cabbie, for example, taking some queues from that genre of style will help contextualize the cabbie in a way that makes it less jarring to look at.	episode_done:True
text:Hats - discussion	labels:I love hats but hats don’t love me.	episode_done:True
text:Hats - discussion	labels:I think "hat energy" is just the confidence to wear one. My ex used to visibly cringe whenever I tried a hat on and so I believed I was too ugly to wear a hat. After I divorced him, I started wearing hats regularly and now have a wall dedicated to my collection. I needed a little time to get used to seeing myself in a hat and I prefer wearing them with large sunglasses because it looks more stylish to me.

text:Hats - discussion	labels:My "hat energy" translates to "college kid who skateboards and/or plays hacky sack." As in, I have an entire drawer full of knit beanies (both fitted and slouchy) that I cycle between. I have one in almost every color, some with pompoms, one with my first initial embroidered on, one Nike with a gold metal Nike emblem sewn on, some thin and others thick and chunky. I love beanies of all kind and will never part with my collection. I used to have a couple other random hats, like a straw fedora and a black and white printed sun hat, but they never seemed to mesh well with my fashion sense and I ended up getting rid of them to free up space for... more beanies.	episode_done:True

text:Sounds like a great hat! Happy cake day!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Hats - discussion	labels:I hadn’t heard of “hat energy” before, but I DO believe in it. I also believe it can be faked, as I have done my entire life. High school and college saw my collection of fedoras/trembleys grow. Kind of died for a while. Then my 20s ushered in wider brim hats because I’m pale and hate sun screen.   I get compliments all the time, and people love to say how they can’t pull off a hat. I always tell them I feel the same way and you’ve just gotta commit to it because it’s true.	episode_done:True
text:Hats - discussion	labels:Hats are great. When you wear one with aplomb, people remember you! It’s just a matter of practice. How to remove and put one on in public (which you may have to do, for example in restaurants). There’s hat etiquette which varies in different eras and places, but I go with not wearing a man style hat while eating, and during times of remembrance/commemoration, and when in doubt. I believe ladies hats can be left on indoors.  The other thing is, WIND. If it’s windy, you’ll need a chin strap or have it snugly on. A blown off hat is annoying.	episode_done:True

text:Hats - discussion	labels:Oh, BIG hat energy.  I think hats are the only accessory I consistently wear. Pom-pom toques in the winter, berets/wide-brimmed felt hats whenever it's warmer, and as soon as the sun pops up you better believe I have a beach-sized hat on my head...  ...in the middle of London.   I LOVE hats. I have a wall dedicated to them (best storage option I found, plus it looks pretty damn cool) and I'll wear them forever!	episode_done:True

text:How do I improve my fashion sense beyond just tshirt and jeans?	labels:Go on Pinterest and pin things that catch your eye. Once you have a board try and find similarities between the pins (for example ruffles, silk, strappy backs etc) and start searching up those things at stores that are within your price range.  In terms of comfort, look for materials you like and what silhouettes you’re into. If you tend to do tighter tops with more volume at the bottom then look for dresses that match that for example. If you know you like cotton blends look for those.    Also look for stores that carry petite sections or find a tailor in your area  Don’t go crazy trying to push yourself too far out of your comfort zone. Look for things that are your style but that you’ve never worn before.
text:Similarly, I often look at tv and movies to see what I like - whether it’s a piece of clothing or a general look that character has, it’s a nice starting point to see what you like and don’t like and the aesthetic you might want to go for.  I am 5ft and I find that certain types of clothing are more likely to fit at non petite sizes, like skinny jeans (since they can scrunch up at the bottom a bit and it doesn’t look wierd)and tighter skirts. Brand I have found good petite clothing at include Express, GAP, Ann Taylor, and Loft	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Start with shoes and bags/accessories! This is what I did when I started growing out of my younger fashion. It makes it easy to update an outfit and eventually led me to wanting to update to nicer things as I went along. I feel like clothing is a slow collection, don't buy everything at once. Find a couple things you like and that you wear consistently and start to add as you go. So many times I convinced myself that I would wear something and it wound up in the back of my closet so just make sure you take your time!	labels:	episode_done:True

text:How do I improve my fashion sense beyond just tshirt and jeans?	labels:An easy transition from tees can be a cami (satin or something drapey) with a cropped or duster length cardigan. It seems more put together because you’re combining items and layering, but is still very comfortable. Add jewelry and mix up the shoes and you’re done. Variations of this can take you from super casual to the office to date night.	episode_done:True
text:How do I improve my fashion sense beyond just tshirt and jeans?	labels:I used to always wear jeans and t-shirts too (and still do a lot of the time), but what has helped me is just paying attention to people around me and what they wear. Friends, acquaintances, strangers. For me, this helps a lot more than looking online because I feel like I can't really tell what the clothes look like in real life.  TV shows or movies help too, where I can see how the clothing a character wears contributes to their "vibe" and matches their personality or other things the creators want to show. Sometimes that's even better than real life because so much thought goes into what the characters wear and what it says about them.  A big barrier for me was the cost of buying new clothes when I'm not really sure if I'll like them long-term, so it's helped to borrow or trade clothes with friends to try new things out. One of my friends used to organize a big clothing swap once a year. Thrift stores, Facebook buying & selling groups, and discount places are also a good option.  Another barrier was that I had only really seen fashion as being about creating a feminine image and emphasizing a slim body type. I would always be upset with my body for not looking like that. I've recently learned I feel much more myself in more androgynous and masc clothing, which I think is why I liked jeans and T-shirts so much. Realizing what I actually like to look like makes it feel a lot more natural and intuitive.	episode_done:True
text:How do I improve my fashion sense beyond just tshirt and jeans?	labels:T shirts and jeans are a great staple and can be totally changed up. I basically only wear t shirts and jeans too, but I’ll change it up a bit with different shoes - Chelsea boots, sneakers, timberland boots, loafers.   Also, different Jean types, tops and jewelry can change up your look while still maintaining the “t shirt and jeans” style.

text:I agree with you, as I aged and had other responsibilities I realised I did not care to follow trends.  Though I enjoy following fashion and learning what is going on. It is interesting to look at it as an expression of culture, social and public mood, technology advances, and as an artistic expression.  It's also interesting to see how fashion percolate (the famous Devil Wears Prada scene on the jumper).  On that same note, as fashion changes, it is difficult not to follow it. Trends come into most clothes we buy no matter what we trie to do.	labels:>Trends come into most clothes we buy no matter what we trie to do.  Exactly. And it's also really difficult to predict what will culturally "stick" as a more longterm trend that may even end up being a "classic." I remember when skinny jeans were becoming a thing and people decried they they'd be a passing trend, when they've gone really strong only until very recently (and even though they're no longer super fashionable, they're still a common "basic" at this point.)   I was recently watching an old episode of "What Not To Wear" and Clinton was aghast at the trend of people wearing white sneakers/trainers to the grocery store and anywhere other than the gym. That reaction seems so weird now that athleisure has become so ubiquitous.

text:What is something you've heard as fashion advice that isn't worth following?	labels:I don't think any fashion rule should be followed. You should take heed of them, but there just general guidelines and tips not the holy word of the lord. If you are self conscious of your wide hips, then it's a good thing to be aware that a lot of horizontal striped will exaggerate this. Doesn't mean you can't or shouldn't, just that you should be cognizant to check before buying any horizontal stripes. Pretty much every fashion rule *can* be broken, but it takes you understanding why the rule is the rule before you can understand how & when you can get away with breaking it   I think *most* attempts to inject color theory into style advice is overly reductionist and doesn't quite work for most people (*especially* for non-white people)  I also think that most shoe advice and recommendations should be ignored. If you do not like heels or are not good at walking in heels, than no, 2 inch wedged are *not* a "laid back summer look for a garden party". You're gonna look fucking ridiculous clomping around. On the other hand, if you *love* platforms and know how to rock them, then there's very few circumstances where you can't figure out a way to make platforms work. Plus, people don't pay nearly as much attention to shoes as you'd think anyway. For most people, it's not in our eyeliner of what we look at when we look at a person. So just wear what you like regardless of the kind of shoes deemed "appropriate". I think that with "Personal style", shoes are substantially more personal than style compared to other items.	episode_done:True

Personally I would love for 2000s jeans to come back - not super low rise or the ones that were bedazzled or laced up but just normal rise bootcut and flare jeans. I have a few from that era that I still wear all the time and a couple more that I had to replace with similar ones from poshmark because I couldn't find them in shops.  I also miss 2000s makeup.

Not everything in the 2000s was horrible lol.
text:> there was also the fresh dewy look of blush and a light lip gloss - think Britney Spears in her Oops I Did It Again video, or Mandy Moore's makeup in her video for Candy.  Ohh this took me way back! lol. Do you remember when MAC Prrr lipglass was huge and everyone was going crazy over JLo's makeup in the All I Have music video?!	labels:I remember Hilary Duff saying her favorite makeup was MAC Lipglass lmao. After that, I noticed how it was promoted everywhere by everyone. And Jennifer Lopez's makeup always looked amazing. She hasn't aged physically since the late 90's.  I still think the best makeup I've ever seen was in Mean Girls. Everything from the color choices to the application. Everyone just looked more alive lol. The baked face/matte colors/highlight and contouring that eventually became popular was pretty in it's own way but I felt like it made everyone look like plastic barbie dolls. I'm glad that trend is slowly dying out and I'm finally seeing more lipglosses and rosy shades being sold again.	episode_done:True

text:Is Y2K fashion coming back organically or is it a result of progressing the 90's comeback to the next decade since that trend seemed to work out?	labels:i personally disagree that there are no aesthetic reasons for y2k fashion to come back. there definitely are, or else it wouldn't be as huge as it is!! i personally love a lot of aspects of y2k fashion. :) but you're right that nostalgia is a huge part of it. nostalgia as a whole is so trendy these days. for example my whole tiktok is full of people talking about shows from their childhood, or toys, or disney channel stars from our childhood. "1999, 2004, 2008" picture day tiktoks are also a huge trend right now. i've even seen tons of people talking about 2011-2014 nostalgia which wasn't even that long ago!! it's insane how it's such a big thing. i'm honestly more interested in analyzing why everyone's so nostalgic in general these days haha

text:I watched the vampire diaries when I was about 13 (I was born in 2000, so I was too young for it when it first came out) and I remember being so jealous that Elena and her friends would wear those bootcut, mid-low rise jeans. In 2013-2015 jeans that were not skinny and up to your ribcage were barely socially acceptable.	labels:I’ve been re-watching Supernatural and the styles the women wore in that show take me back! I kept pointing out to my boyfriend the low-rise bootcut jeans/overall outfit and saying, “oh, I would have worn that in 2008!” I was in High School too when I watched Vampire Diaries and I remember how I wanted to dress like Elena. The Y2K trend I feel isn’t an exact copy of what we wore, but just pieces of the era made modern. Overall, the re-cycling of Y2K trends are very nostalgic for me.	episode_done:True
text:Wardrobe not updated	labels:I feel like at 32 years old, I've passed looking at trends and have just figured out over the years what looks good on my body. I dont think anything I own is trendy by today's standards cause anymore I tend to look at fit, rather than style, if that makes sense. I used to walk by shops and be unable to decide which items I wanted to take home cause i thought everything was cute, and then end up with a closet full of stuff I hardly wore or felt embarrassed by later lol. Ive become much more selective and comfortable with the pieces I do choose to invest in, and dont think much about whether or not it's in style.  I still get compliments from younger and older people so I don't *think* I look outdated or backwards, but I dont care if I do, either, haha	episode_done:True
text:Wardrobe not updated	labels:Wardrobe not updated? You might have to download a patch.   srs though, don't buy stuff for the sake of your fantasy self. It sounds like you want to be a person who goes outside in jeans and sneakers, but you're not right now, and you might be interested in different things once we're all vaccinated and getting back to normal. When I add something to my wardrobe, it's something that I want now, to satisfy the self that stays indoors and shreds documents for funsies. (I wish my life were more interesting than this. Alas.)	episode_done:True
text:Wardrobe not updated	labels:i understand! i think it’s a smart financial approach right now. especially bc we’re, in my opinion, in a very “trendy” phase of fashion right now and a lot of hot styles are not going to last very long.  however, i have nearly the opposite problem! i normally don’t wear what’s “in fashion” as i have a very particular aesthetic, and i felt very very liberated and “seen” by the trends of last spring/summer, bought myself a very nearly full new wardrobe (i also lost a ton of weight so it wasn’t a completely impractical decision) and i am a sitting duck waiting for next spring/summer and i will be wearing everything i bought last year and i don’t give a damn if it’s not the trend anymore.	episode_done:True
text:Wardrobe not updated	labels:Who even knows what will be in style when the pandemic is over? Save your money? Where are you going anyway?
text:Totally! I think we will see new trends being available, but average people simply wearing what they have with some updates vs entire wardrobe overhauls. I find it refreshing that there is less pressure to feel fashionable in regards to trends at the moment. I mean... I’m wearing stretch pants and lounge bras half the time now as I WFH. I feel Fly AF when I put on actual pants and a real bra!	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Wardrobe not updated	labels:I can relate. I have several years’ worth of “fond” memories of going to the stores and hating everything, so I haven’t been trendy for a while either.

text:Wardrobe not updated	labels:What makes sense for you, your life, your budget, your mental health, your storage space etc? These are questions I consider for myself.   Following fashion trends can be fun to engage in, but I'd recommend asking yourself whether you follow the trend because you like it or you feel societal pressure. Are you doing it for yourself? If so, is there something else you could be doing to substitute that would cost less money, use up less space, last longer, etc?   I've acquired a few things since Covid, and the later purchases have been way more mindful than what I bought initially. I've been investing more time into hobbies I've been meaning to get back into in lieu of online window shopping mindlessly. You see more things to buy, you'll likely have more urges to shop.   It does feel like my wardrobe is in a time capsule-- more so the idea of "these are clothes I wore pre-Covid" and now "these are the clothes I currently wear." In a way, things feel dated because they are no longer in active rotation. But I don't feel the need to get rid of things I like. If I no longer like them, then there's no reason to hold onto them.  I bought warm clothes for the winter and I've been very grateful. I don't pay a lot of attention to trends as an indicator for what I should buy, but rather if I like something then I might invest time into finding the right version of x piece. But lately... I can't justify too many purchases and that's okay! Enjoying trends vicariously is just as good as owning something.	episode_done:True
text:Wardrobe not updated	labels: I feel like (depending on where you live) we are all stuck in a holding pattern. I would normally buy more "work shirts" at this time of year, but there isn't much point since I'm only on the job site about one day a week (and it's so cold indoors, I'm always bundled up anyway).   I've encountered some similar issues before when I had to switch to work from home a few years ago due to a move. A lot of my new purchases went unworn. If I learned anything from that experience, it was to spend money on clothes that are for the house or for trips outside, not for work. In practice, this meant a lot of yoga pants, but also light summer clothes that were suitable for walking the dog. Most of the work staples just didn't even register. I know it isn't fun, but it's not a bad thing to wait and see what happens in your area.	episode_done:True
text:Wardrobe not updated	labels:Most of my wardrobe was office appropriate, so I’ve bought some comfy clothes and basics over the past year. I’d love to get some nicer clothes, but I’m WFH and there’s no place or occasion to wear them. I’d love to update my wardrobe, but I don’t want to buy things just to sit in my closet and possibly not fit or be out of style by the time I can wear them. Also, I still don’t know if WFH is temporary or if my employer will decide to keep us remote, so I wouldn’t know yet if I should update my casual or work appropriate wardrobe.	episode_done:True

text:I second the Blundstones! I've had the #1351 Original High-Top Boots and the #584 Thermal Chelsea Boots, and I love them both. The #1351 have a slimmer ankle and are water-resistant. The #584 are completely water-proof and have a removable sheepskin footbed and are super warm. I wore them nearly every day last winter, and they still look new. They do take a bit of breaking in though, especially the #584 because the ankle is slim.	labels:	episode_done:True

If they get too broken down, you can send them in and they’ll replace the rubber sole and spruce them up.  Every couple of weeks I keep the leather soft by rubbing Chamberlain’s Leather Milk on them and they’re soft and supple despite frequent negative degree temps (0 degrees today!).   I truly can’t recommend them enough.	episode_done:True

text:How does your makeup style and clothing style relate? - discussion	labels:I have WAY too much makeup and love to vary my eye looks every day.  My makeup look depends on what is going on that day?  Do I have a work Zoom where I need to look presentable?  Then I'll do a neutral look with taupe/pink.  (Meanwhile, I can wear a nice top and PJ pants on that Zoom call.) If I don't need to be on camera, then the sky is the limit and I will go wild and colorful.  I have over 30 palettes and do a shop my stash rotation.  Also if it is a holiday, I will do a look in that holiday's colors.  Coming up is a pink look and later a green one.	episode_done:True
text:How does your makeup style and clothing style relate? - discussion	labels:Nope, they are completely separate. When I wear makeup, it’s always minimal and designed around hiding my flaws and making me look healthier.

text:How does your makeup style and clothing style relate? - discussion	labels:Im Op I’ll share mine-  Personally I sort of plan my makeup look based of what I’m wearing   I do mostly dramatic Smokey eyes and cut crease looks with bright blush and lipstick everywhere in colors that either match my outfit or just compliment it well! I also do more eye liner dramatic looks at times as well! Usually if I’m wearing something a bit more cutesy I’ll do my makeup to reflect the look. If Im wearing my black velvet blazer set I’ll do thé likes of and orange and gold Smokey eye to make it more bold and less professional looking! I have a very dressy style with masculine, Victorian, and highly detailed elements so bold colorful makeup makes some of my more stuffy looks less boring. I’ve lately been after doing my foundation putting a bit of blush from the bottom front of my eye bags to the top of my brow bone. I love how it makes makeup a little more unique and makes me look a little less baby faced.  I used to wear very skater boyish/ art kid outfits and hair ( I still respect the style still though ) but wore heavy Instagram glam style makeup. I still do glam makeup but it looked quite odd at times! I didn’t really think much about makeup in relation to clothing then, not that it’s really necessary! I feel I’ve come far with my style!

text:How does your makeup style and clothing style relate? - discussion	labels:I only wear makeup in places I can’t get in trouble for it (i.e. not work) because the only makeup I own is foundation, concealer, and COLORS.

text:How does your makeup style and clothing style relate? - discussion	labels:I like to coordinate makeup with outfits or wear makeup that doesn’t match, but that compliments my outfit . I love makeup, especially lipstick so much. If I’m wearing a red dress generally I’ll also wear a red lip. I have a mustard yellow dress that I think looks amazing with an orangey-red lipstick I have. I have a light lavender/lilac coloured dress that I like to wear a plumb lipstick with or a lilac coloured eyeshadow. If I’m going for a more neutral look I do beige or pink eyeshadow and a nude lipstick. I also think white tops and dresses look really good with red or bright pink lipstick.	episode_done:True
text:How does your makeup style and clothing style relate? - discussion	labels:I wear two types of makeup: red lip with no eye makeup or eyeliner with nude lip.

text:How does your makeup style and clothing style relate? - discussion	labels:My makeup tends to stay the same unless it’s for a formal occasion and even then, that usually just means I use an eyeshadow that’s even sparklier than usual and go just a little heavier on the blush. I tend to stick to light, shimmery, pink-champagne-white tones for shadow and generally rock a nude lip unless I’m feeling spicy. I have a couple good berry lips and some deep reds.	episode_done:True
text:How do you handle budget increases when it comes to clothes? (ex. going from student to working professional)	labels:You Need A Budget. No, really - it's the best money-management app/process I've found. I signed up when I realized that I had promise to pay for a family Italian cruise because I had my first well-paying job - But I didn't seem to be getting ahead even though I was making twice as much as I had before. Zero-based budgeting in general is the way to go but I love YNAB for making that system easy to manage.  The thing that works for me about zero-based is that I can really easily prioritize the things that are important to me and also see the trade-off I'm making for every purchase if I change those priorities. It keeps those little windfalls or pay raises from just vanishing into the ether. I got paid $64 last week for a poshmark sale, and I immediately put that money in my March rent category. Before, I would have gone and bought a new shirt, or spent it all on soup dumplings, or bought a new shirt and then spilled the soup dumplings I also bought on the new shirt. 😅  If fashion is important to you, then you can prioritize that and invest in a wardrobe that will give you joy. If it's travel, put your money toward that instead, and you'll feel the power to walk away from a good sale because you know it's just a distraction from your real goals. I still spend a lot on clothes and eating out, but I no longer feel guilty or stressed about it, because when I spend it's a conscious choice.  I guess this is more general financial advice than specific to OP's situation, but I find it useful for any of us who have expensive hobbies (aka all of mine) or potential big expenses like OP's.	episode_done:True
text:How do you handle budget increases when it comes to clothes? (ex. going from student to working professional)	labels:I have a pretty extensive budget that I still have plenty of room for clothes shopping in! I have had a budget since I started working professionally 3 years ago.  I have three sections: Bills (phone, rent, student loans, power etc), Expenses (food, gas, “fun”) and Savings (anything I’m saving up for: laptop, trips, gifts, my niece’s college fund, hobbies, and clothes! As well as an emergency fund where everything else goes).  I generally consider the clothing fund to be a low priority so I set about $40 a paycheque to it, but I don’t necessarily spend that much every two weeks. I also usually cap it at $500, where if it’s grown to that amount then I take my $40 every two weeks and put it to something else.   Generally I don’t spend all of it before a new paycheque comes along but if I do, I will use some of my “fun” money in expenses to cover the rest.   I have gotten two pay increases in the last two years as well as moved houses twice + paid off my loan (different bill amounts) so whenever I readjust my budget I start with my bills, generally keep my fun + grocery amounts the same, and then increase my savings categories a bit while mostly prioritizing putting the excess into my emergency account. When I started working I think I was setting aside $20 or $25 for clothes, now up to $40.  Maybe more long-winded than you wanted but that’s the jist :)	episode_done:True
text:How do you handle budget increases when it comes to clothes? (ex. going from student to working professional)	labels:I had a career and location change where I had a lot more disposable income than before and I definitely overspent on clothing/shoes/bags I didn’t need. It’s weird because it’s something I never did when I made less money. This years focus is to pay off debt and sell items I’m not actually using or don’t actually love. And stick to my budget on mint.com.	episode_done:True
text:How do you handle budget increases when it comes to clothes? (ex. going from student to working professional)	labels:Raising awareness of what I actually use.   Complimenting people's insistence that you budget, you also need to know where YOU will find the best VALUE of your wardrobe spending. What do you use? What are statement pieces of your fashion? What brings you the most joy?   * I have been using a closet inventory app. Stylebook tracks the costs and number of times I actually wear my clothes with which outfits too.   Although some styling habits might seem like common sense (like basic quality t-shirts and winter coating pay off), I learnt about other neat tendencies:  Scarves vs Sweaters. Scarves might seem more versatile and can pair with so many outfits for other people. But honestly, I live in sweaters.. maybe because it's cold... or maybe because I want to be cozy. If I didn't have the style app, I would probably think about 'investing' in a cashmere scarf. Now, I'm so much happier to budget for vintage pre-loved cashmere sweaters.   Do I even put on my accessories? Bracelets? Necklaces? Nope. Apparently throwing on colourful clothes is my go-to. I save so much money, not buying any jewelry - no bracelets, no necklaces, no earrings. (It makes my savings happier)  * I prioritize my next purchases from there.   The other thing I've invested in: **10x spending more in proper clothing care.** Proper laundry detergent, keeping old toothbrushes to scrub stains, a foldable drying rack, a sweater comb, and leather conditioners.   * Clothing care, only way to keep clothes looking professional and last.
text:Thanks for posting this! I’ve had the Stylebook app forever now but haven’t put in the work to enter all the necessary info. It’s great to read such detailed, practical feedback on it and makes me want to start using it more intentionally.   And you’re SO right about clothing care.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do you handle budget increases when it comes to clothes? (ex. going from student to working professional)	labels:I don't have a prescribed budget that I stick to, but I try my best to ensure I max out my generous 401k match and other accounts provided from my employer. I have a certain amount I keep stashed away as an emergency fund if I can't work for several months, some for paranoia from being raised lower-income and some for the fact that I live in a HCOL area. Other than that, I am super flexible with how I spend my money, which is ~dangerous~. Luckily, fashion and food are my only pricey hobbies. I'm really privileged to be in this position with a rewarding job and understand that this is not the norm for many.  I got a substantial promotion and raise this last summer, so I definitely have been overspending this year as I try to ramp my wardrobe back to my ideal self, rather than my more practical self; I was also purchasing a limited number of pieces since I was in a client-facing role making half as much. I moved from buying clothes on the more affordable spectrum (mainly pre-scandal Everlane, and KOTN) to buying pricier pieces, usually in the pre-owned designer spectrum (mainly bags, shoes, and outerwear ranging from $200-$3000). I'm finally scaling back by having a curated wishlist and aiming to resell any unused pieces (easier said than done).	episode_done:True
text:How do you handle budget increases when it comes to clothes? (ex. going from student to working professional)	labels:Hmm I don't set money aside for clothes specifically. I have a general budget divided into monthly bills, savings, food, and other expenses. Clothes usually fall under "other expenses", unless it would be a huge purchase that I'd have to save up for specifically - but that rarely happens).  I only buy clothes like 3-4 times a year, usually to replace old stuff, or if my wardrobe needs some extra something, or if I find a really nice item that I'll definitely wear a lot. I know what sort of styles, colors, fabrics etc I tend to go for. I avoid impulse purchases, I already have enough stuff sitting around because I have nothing to match it with or nowhere to wear it lmao	episode_done:True
text:How do you handle budget increases when it comes to clothes? (ex. going from student to working professional)	labels:Budget + plan ahead! I definitely fell for the lifestyle creep when I first started working, and it unfortunately took me too long to dig my way out. Now that I have, I use the 50/30/20 budget, and if there's something I want and it's not currently in my budget, I'll wait until the next month to get it when there is. I also mostly shop at Aritzia bc their sizing works best for me, so I've also learned their sale cycle and I usually plan ahead so that I do most of my clothing shopping during those times.	episode_done:True
text:How do you handle budget increases when it comes to clothes? (ex. going from student to working professional)	labels:I finished up grad school last year and started working full time, so I totally went through that transition. For me, I don’t have a set clothing budget, but I do have a monthly “wants” budget that clothing purchases go into. I try to be strategic and identify gaps in my wardrobe and work from there, buying things as I have the money/need for them. It has been a big change going from mostly buying secondhand to having more to spend, but I still love to thrift/posh etc. My budget now is significantly more than it was in grad school though, so I have more flexibility.   One of the more difficult parts for me was feeling like I needed nicer, high quality items for work. Those get expensive! For example I recently bought a wool dress coat since I only had a parka. I am lucky in that my work is quite casual, so most of my wardrobe works for both work and casual stuff.	episode_done:True
text:How do you handle budget increases when it comes to clothes? (ex. going from student to working professional)	labels:When I had to buy business/work clothes, I invested in a really nice, fitted black suit, a couple of collared shirts, and a pair of flats. Those were my basic essentials that I knew I could mix and match with a lot of stuff. Everything else I picked up at Goodwill.   My coworkers commented on my cute clothes so I think it was a great strategy. I collected a pretty huge work closet for practically pennies.  After that, I've never had a clothing budget. My closet is a pretty good deterrent of overspending because I hate clutter and I hate having a crammed closet so if I think I dont have room and an item I'm looking at isn't worth creating room in my closet, I dont buy it.	episode_done:True
text:How do you handle budget increases when it comes to clothes? (ex. going from student to working professional)	labels:For the last few years I started tracking all of my spending. I then make an educated guess for what my budget should be for the upcoming year, based on past averages and predictions about what type of life events might be coming up that year.   Each paycheck, I set some money aside to my Girly Savings. This way, when I do a bunch of shopping or find an expensive item, it's not just coming out of my general spending money.   Currently I'm setting aside $400/month to my Girly Savings which includes clothes, makeup, skincare, hair and accessories. I buy most of my clothes in large batches in the spring and fall so it helps me to have an accumulated stash of cash.	episode_done:True

text:Absolutely!! I do what I can, but mostly I just try to buy less because even cheap clothes are a huge portion of my income. If your budget is such that a $50 jacket is already a big purchase you're only doing every few years and a $900 jacket is impossible, it's ok to buy the cheap version and keep yourself warm.	labels:1000%! I have a parka from American Eagle that I got in high school (I graduated 11 years ago...) that I still wear every winter. Was it sustainably and ethically made? Likely not, but thanks to that $70 purchase I’ve avoided buying who knows how many new coats.	episode_done:True
text:Is fast fashion really fast fashion if you get years of use out of the garments?	labels:My personal philosophy: If all you can afford is fast fashion, but you buy minimally and wear frequently and for a long time, no one should judge you for not being sustainable. That’s absolutely a valid way to participate in slow fashion. If you can afford ethical brands though, then I think you should purchase from them instead.	episode_done:True
text:Is fast fashion really fast fashion if you get years of use out of the garments?	labels:I love that you brought this up. Of course, there are are ethical retailers out there that have lower prices, but if you are young and/or poor, there is a certain amount of fast fashion that you need to buy because it fits your price/budget. Even though it isn’t ideal, not all fast fashion is gone in a couple years, if you are buying less trendy pieces you can wear for a while.  Many things I’ve bought from fast fashion retailers I’ve had for years - I haven’t changed my height or weight much in over 10 years, so I have tops from Old Navy I have had for 10 years and other clothes that have lasted way past 5 years.  Reducing consumption is a key part of ethical fashion and even if you buy it from a retailer that is cheaper because that’s what you can afford, if you keep it a long time and don’t buy a bunch of clothes all the time, you are reducing demand and helping the environment.	episode_done:True
text:Is fast fashion really fast fashion if you get years of use out of the garments?	labels:I’ve struggled with this as well. I think the most important thing is to just consume less. Easier said then done that’s for sure.   I’ve definitely had clothes from forever 21 last longer than aritzia. I’ve gotten clothing from thrift stores that have lasted me longer as well.	episode_done:True
text:Is fast fashion really fast fashion if you get years of use out of the garments?	labels:The reason why fast fashion is often seen as bad is because fast fashion is synonymous with trendy clothes that wear out within 2/3 washes and unethical labor practices.   Trends change very fast and If a shirt is $5, how much do you think each person who worked on it is getting paid?  I personally have a hard time believing in sustainable fashion nowadays because so many brands that marketed themselves as sustainable have been found to use the same practices as unsustainable ones. This includes high end fashion labels that sell a T-shirt for $2000 but pays their employees the same as forever 21.   So I think of you can get multiple wear out of a fast fashion item, it’s a win for you as an individual. More expensive doesn’t always mean better practices or quality. I’ve bought more expensive items that lasted just as long or not even as long as my Zara items.	episode_done:True
text:Is fast fashion really fast fashion if you get years of use out of the garments?	labels:r/zerowaste has had discussions on the topic. So has r/frugal I guess and there are a few other subs. I don't think there is a fixed rule. The world is changing too fast for that.  Maybe the key is to scale down spending, thrift as much as possible and be critical when shopping. Price does not necessarily equals quality.    The way I see it, high-end brands are just expensive. Nowadays luxury brands seem to be as mass-produced as anything else. Profit above all.  I also have realized that brand loyalty in the 21st century might have become a bit silly. I have trusted brands in the past but it seems pointless now, bc even sizing can change randomly.  Maybe customers shd spend more carefully. Buy what is needed, make sure what you are getting is looking good on you, it looks well-made and it feels nice on your skin. It is better to have fewer garments that make you look superb than many trashy pieces that will not do you any justice. Every person has their beauty, we shd only have and wear what makes us look fabulous.  My two cents	episode_done:True
text:Is fast fashion really fast fashion if you get years of use out of the garments?	labels:The most sustainable choice is the one that is already in your closet. If you already own something that wasn’t made ethically or sustainably, there’s no benefit in trashing it if you still like it and can use it. In a similar vein, there’s already so much clothing out there, that buying something second hand that’s still in good shape is often an option.  I think aritzia and j crew are still fast fashion, just more expensive fast fashion than old navy or forever 21- they’re still introducing tons of new products and feeding in to the consumerist drive to have the newest things.   No one is perfect, but we can strive to reduce our impact on an individual scale and aim to reduce our purchases, focus on buying used when it’s possible and try to purchase ethical and local when it’s not.  I definitely am not perfect on this front, but I try and buy from consignment shops as a first choice when I want something, and I’m working to choose smaller brands that have clear supply chains and ethical manufacturing. If it’s made in Canada (where I’m from) then that’s awesome.  At the end of the day I hope that my fashion choices exploit the least number of people and has the lowest environmental impact possible, and often that looks like me telling myself I don’t really need the new thing, even if I think it’s amazing and really really want it	episode_done:True
text:Is fast fashion really fast fashion if you get years of use out of the garments?	labels:Capitalism has made us believe we can always buy our way out of problems--that consuming differently will fix the consumption problem. The true antidote, like others have said, is buying less and taking good care of the items you have and like (ethically sourced or not). I don't think there is much difference between Forever 21 and J Crew, just the price. No one is going to advertise "buy less", "wash your stuff gently!" because...how do you make money doing that? It's on us to see the sham and make the changes necessary	episode_done:True
text:Is fast fashion really fast fashion if you get years of use out of the garments?	labels:Sustainable consumption complicated and everyone is going to have their own ways to go about it. It's good that you're keeping and using what you buy for years (no matter what the brand), so that's a start.  Synthetics are made of plastic and can release microplastics into the environment when they are worn and washed. Cotton takes up lots of land and water. Leather lasts way longer than pleather but then you have the cruelty aspect and tanning leather does require a lot of harmful chemicals. Expensive doesn't always mean ethical, but ethical clothing does tend to cost more. There is always going to be a footprint - not buying anything at all is probably the safest and most sustainable way but obviously we still need things now and then!   It's taken me YEARS to change my habits and transition to a better wardrobe, and even then I'm still not fast fashion-free. I had to wait to use up what I had and be able to afford something better. It took time to refine and define my style to determine what pieces would give me the most mileage. Each person will have to determine what is important to them when it comes to sustainability. Like, I'm not very picky about my purses but I tend to vet my shoes and what my options are when it comes time to repair or dispose of them.	episode_done:True
text:What's been your experience with men's stores/departments?	labels:I usually don’t experience any negativity when shopping in the men’s dept. Go after what you’re into and don’t worry about the employees anyway! One thing I will say is for pants or shorts, in my experience, it’s better to buy masculine styled clothes fit for women. Then you avoid the weird men’s fitting and bulge.
text:Agreed. My son is FTM and finds most men’s pants to be problematic because his hips aren’t straight. He does a lot of elastic waists and athletic wear. You’re probably better off with bottom items designed for women. As for the employees...I wouldn’t worry. People are more open minded than ever, and if they do act rude you can take your business elsewhere.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What's been your experience with men's stores/departments?	labels:No one has ever bothered me, I’ve even had a female sales clerk agree with me that men’s shirts are more comfortable.  I typically only buy men’s tops, tees or hoodies or sweatshirts. I don’t try for fitted, only loose, and usually go for second hand since I mostly wear it as loungewear.  Pants I haven’t had much luck with. If the waist can be cinched small enough, that means the hips barely fit or they are way too tight when I sit down or bend over. A medium is too large and can’t be cinched small enough.  Board shorts/basketball shorts are ok, the leg is loose enough to accommodate the lady hips, regardless of the waist size. I generally don’t like the look of these on me, but you may have different preferences.	episode_done:True
text:What's been your experience with men's stores/departments?	labels:I only have bought outdoorswear that is designed for men, but SAs don't seem weird about it.

text:What's been your experience with men's stores/departments?	labels:Not trans and don't dress intentionally masculine, but I'm a woman who shops in the men's section all the time and it's fine! Just do it and after the first couple of times it'll feel easy. Anybody who is rude to you has the problem, not you, but it's never happened to me, including while shopping in other countries - - in Japan I wouldn't fit in most women's clothes, so I basically have to shop the men's and they seemed to think it was interesting and were happy to make the sale.  Maybe not the most apposite comment for your situation but wanted you to have the perspective that there are a lot of reasons you might be shopping there so you don't even have to feel like you're under undue scrutiny. One more suggestion: if you can, it might be easier to shop in a bigger city; in New York nobody would blink.	episode_done:True
text:What's been your experience with men's stores/departments?	labels:I used to get heaps of stuff at the men's as well. Some  pieces are much nicer when made for them, don't ask me why.  Just go there and if you feel uncomfortable you can always say you have to try them on in order to see whether it fits your husband/partner/boyfriend/etc.   I actually did this many times, including for my dad, bc I knew how it shd look on me in order to fit them (sleeve length, shoulders etc).  Staff shd not really care, I guess -?   Imho, trousers are a bit trickier but I have bought men's shorts and pants as well, you just have to check them out and see....  Good luck and happy shopping :)	episode_done:True
text:What's been your experience with men's stores/departments?	labels:My partner shops in the men's section and hasn't had any issues, to my knowledge.   Brands that have worked include Lucky brand (especially for jeans), Banana Republic (boxer briefs and button-downs), and I think American Eagle (t-shirts, maybe shorts I think). I'll try to think of others.   They've also had a lot of luck at a certain local thrift store that carries a lot of menswear, which admittedly can be tricky to find and is especially challenging during a pandemic. That's a great way to find out what brands and styles work best for your body though: try out a ton of different ones.   Consider if there are any ways to access hand-me-downs from friends for this, too - my friends had a lot of clothing swaps in the before times and lots of my queer friends wear or used to wear men's clothes. If not your friends, there may be groups in your area that share or trade clothes. And on that note, regardless of your own identity, you might find some other ideas online by looking at queer fashion resources online.   Regarding the brands I've mentioned above, my partner's physique is relatively long and lean, so take this advice with a grain of salt if you are plus sized and/or generally have curvier proportions. For example, I'm close in size to them or possibly even a bit smaller right now, but I am smaller on top than on the bottom. That's pretty inconvenient for men's clothes, so I would probably need to shop a bit differently. There are definitely plus-sized and curvy queer bloggers out there who look awesome in menswear wardrobes, so hopefully you can find some inspiration about how to make menswear work for your shape.   Finally... If you have the funds, there are definitely custom options available. My partner got a custom suit for our wedding, including some tailored shirts. You can also get off the rack clothes tweaked by a tailor, which is probably something I would want to do.	episode_done:True
text:What's been your experience with men's stores/departments?	labels:I have shopped the men's department before and never had issues with sales associates. The biggest thing was once, they wouldn't let me in the dressing room and I had to go to one on another floor, because there were already men in there (but everyone had their own room and the only communal space was the mirror area? Like, not sure why it mattered, I ended up making the purchase at the register near the other dressing room and the guy lost a sale, which may have been petty but...I'd used that dressing room before with zero issue, so 🤷‍♀️) But I have had issues with some cuts of men's clothes--they aren't really cut for boobs and hips, so I had to get them tailored. There are some companies that do masculine/androgynous looks for those bodies, like Kirrin Finch, that might be worth checking out!	episode_done:True
text:What's been your experience with men's stores/departments?	labels:I work at a mid-higher end men's clothing store and we have women come in regularly for themselves. I can honestly say we 100% don't care who tries on/buys our clothes! We're just happy to help you find something you like and are comfortable in :) The only reason I can think of why you might not be able to try clothes on is if the store doesn't have their dressing rooms open, which unfortunately is the case for a decent amount of retailers around me. If you feel uncomfortable you can always just buy items you think you might like and return them. When it comes to pants I do know they're cut to have extra room in the "bulge" area. I'd recommend finding a lower-cut mens pant just so there will be less room in the fly. Welcome to the world of actually opaque white clothing!	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else have this style issue?	labels:Is there a way you could achieve the same vibe/aesthetic but using different cuts or shapes? I love those silk skirts that are trendy, but I have scoliosis and they just don’t work on my uneven hips. However, pleated maxi skirts achieve the same vibe but fit me better! Maybe there’s something similar you could find too.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else have this style issue?	labels:I noticed it’s the pants with pockets that creates that problem.  Maybe sewing them shut would help the silhouette issue.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else have this style issue?	labels:One thing we don’t talk about much is the importance of tailoring and undergarments for those 50s and 60s looks.  There’s a reason a lot of the actresses on Mad Men had to wear crinolines and girdles and cone bras with their costumes; that’s what created the silhouette.  Also 50s and 60s inspired clothes that have a lot of stretch in the fabric won’t hang or move the same. ETA:  oops, I see you said ‘men’s fashion’.  The part of my comment re: tailoring and fabric content still applies!	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else have this style issue?	labels:This is pretty much what finding your style is.  You're taking what you like or whatever vision you have in your head, and combining it with your reality; your budget, your time investment, your lifestyle, & your actual body.  That said, it's not impossible to pull of a specific look, but if it plays against your strengths, but it's going to be more of a time investment to get it right.  The most efficient way to do this would be to learn how to sew, so that you can either tailor or make everything yourself.  Alternatively, you've got to try on a ton of clothes to get the fit you wan,t and probably still need to get things tailored.  There are a ton of ways that you can get an outfit to lean one way or the other, either through styling or accessories.  Personally, I love a good menswear inspired look; but I don't love it on my body and I'm not gonna be bothered with finding curvy, petite pants when I don't even particularly like pants.  However, chopping off my hair really helped me feel a lot more comfortable wearing more feminine silhouettes without it feeling so feminine.  It might make sense to pick out the elements that work for you (colours? materials? tops?) and mixing it with other things that you like/work for you body.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else have this style issue?	labels:I definitely feel this. I have a large butt/hips and do often find that they impact the shape of silhouettes that I'm trying to wear. I'm very inspired by menswear as well and dress fairly androgynously. I tend to modify menswear silhouettes slightly so that I can achieve something similar. I personally feel much better in high waisted pants with a tucked in shirt/sweater - somehow I feel like it emphasizes my lower body less and gives me a sleeker line from top to bottom, so when I'm drawing influence from menswear I tend to modify it with a higher waistline. I also make sure that I'm defining my upper body with tops that are more structured around the shoulder. Drop shoulders don't play well with me.  I find with these tweaks I'm able to both find a nice balance where I don't feel like I'm fighting against my body and I'm also able to invoke more masculine references and play with most silhouettes I like. Although it did take me a lot of trial and error to figure out it out.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else have this style issue?	labels:It took me quite a bit of time and money to realise that there are some styles I like looking at but do not suit me - either my body type or my personality, or both.  The hardest to let go of was the sort of floaty, drapey, effortless boho style. I wanted to waft around the place like a modern Romantic whilst gardening and being all artsy and shit. But my shape is basically round with hints of hourglass, my personality is not best suited to wafting anywhere (I bounce, mostly), and show me mud or art supplies and I will be covered in them before I've actually got near them. And any skirt that's made of light enough material to drape and waft elegantly, or goes below my knees, is going to be ripped to shreds within a day. So yeah - I admire those looks on other people and have discovered a style I like, that's practical for me and reflects my personality a bit.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else have this style issue?	labels:Figure out what inspires you about the style and then "translate" that to your own shape (and vibe and lifestyle etc). The retro men's khakis probably look good on the men in the photos because they're tailored to flatter that specific shape - they communicate ease and perfection and the possibility of summer fun. Try a capri pant in a bright or summery color that fits your shape to communicate those vibes on yourself.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else have this style issue?	labels:I feel you on this. I love me some 20s and 60s, but my DNA said LOLNOPE  A lady on this very same site told me that she’s got wide hips, but can still wear some stuff designed for the “ideal” 20s body with help from shapewear. Would you try that?	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else have this style issue?	labels:I feel this. In my case I think the problem stems from me getting pieces that I like aesthetically but that have something wrong with them that I ignored/didn’t realize until later. For instance I got these shorts that looked really cute but got really wrinkly around the crotch after I’d sat down, and then they just looked like a monstrosity. Like my entire outfit was completely overshadowed by my goddamn crotch haha. I ended up donating them because I realized that even though they were a style I liked and a great color, the fabric was not right for me. Getting a good pair of khakis that flatter your curves will go a long way. Get them tailored if there is something wrong with the fit on an otherwise good pair of pants. Just look for that holy grail pair that fits you nicely, and don’t buy stuff that is *almost* good enough but has a problem (unless it’s a problem tailoring can fix).	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else have this style issue?	labels:I struggle with this as well, but I have sometimes succeeded in making a style work that didn't come naturally to me. The things that help me the most are:  1) Really studying the references I like. Where is the silhouette loose? Where is it tight? At what point on a limb are the seams tailored to fall? What are the other key styling details I need to recreate? With proper tailoring, I think you can recreate a lot of looks (think of how much contouring your makeup can change your face; it's easy to create illusions on your body even if your body proportions don't cater to the typical silhouette of the lewk)  2) Take photos of your attempts and study those. Having a reference photo of what you tried and then studying it in a similar way can really help you hone in on what's working and what's not. I especially recommend looking back on the photo over the course of a couple days. Seeing a photo of my own styling after some time has passed since I created the look helps me see what is and isn't working more objectively.  3) Experiment, experiment, experiment. This was easier when there wasn't a pandemic and you could go try lots of things on, but it can still be doable. And it often takes a LOT of experimentation, but it can be really fun if you're motivated to expand your style. May not be worth it for everyone though! I think it takes a hobbyist's amount of effort.   Of course, sometimes it may just be that you appreciate a style more on others than on yourself (I will never feel like myself in a bohemian look), or you don't appreciate it enough on yourself to invest the time it would take to nail the execution (which is totally fine!)

text:Brands that no longer live up to their name or quality	labels:kind of all of them? It seems like you have to pay pretty steep prices now to get the quality of clothes that mid-price mall brands had in the 1990s and early 2000s. It seems that most stores have switched to a model of selling poor quality pieces at huge markups with the expectation that they will sell most of the stock at clearance prices. The GAP used to have quality staples, and J Crew was "fancy." Now GAP is really the same quality as Old Navy, and don't know what J Crew is anymore. The quality has certainly dropped, but I also don't get what is up with the designs since you can't even get a reasonable women's suit there these days. Madewell is not made well. Anthropologie used to sell unique pieces with really good construction, now it's roughly the same as other fast fashion, though I do appreciate that they added petite and plus sizing and carry some high end brands too. Levi's main line is terrible now, and to get the heritage quality, you need to get the Made and Crafted line, which is really expensive!  I mostly shop secondhand because I can't afford the stuff I like. When buying new, I try to wait for sales and avoid buying anything "final sale" or with complicated returns unless I know it will work. Clothes that I used to get at Anthropologie, I now get from Sezane, Ulla Johnson, Doen, and Samantha Pleet. I started buying vintage jeans over Madewell/Levi's or expensive craft brands—my 1980s Chic and Gitano jeans were probably sold at K-Mart/Target but are better quality than anything I have gotten from Madewell. I don't wear jeans/denim enough to justify craft denim prices. Patagonia is still very high quality technical wear; I just scope out the Tyler sport outlet and secondhand for deals. Shoes are hard because I don't like to get them secondhand. I switched from Adidas to Veja and Diemme for sneakers (you can find Diemme shoes for huge markdowns on Yoox during the winter and summer sales—I don't think they are worth retail price).
text:Woah, thank you for this very detailed list of what you have experienced with your favorite clothing brands too! And for ideas of where to shop Anthropologie styles outside of the store.

text:Clothes are not the only item that work like this. I hope this is not considered too off-topic, but ...the Revere Ware brand was one that went downhill rapidly after World Market bought Corning (which own Revere Ware) in 1998. I wrote this to the company more than ten years ago:  *At one time, Revere Ware meant quality. After maybe a decade of use, I bought a new Revere Ware tea kettle to replace one that had finally worn out. It lasted a few months before breaking. "A fluke" I thought, and bought another. It lasted even a shorter period of time. I am looking for a stove top tea kettle that will stand up to daily use that is not a disposable item. Clearly, this is not Revere Ware.  I will never buy a Revere Ware anything ever again.*   They then offered to send me a new tea kettle. I wrote back:  *While I appreciate this offer, I will never buy another Revere Ware product ever again.*  *I recently inherited some nice Revere Ware copper-bottomed pots, which are probably 50 years old (or more). These I will continue to use, as they are the quality that one used to associate with the brand.*  *But it is clear that Revere Ware no longer cares about providing a durable product. I have no interest in having you replace a tea kettle with one will break in the space of several weeks.*  *Good luck with the business model you have chosen*   And the business model? Well, World Kitchen discontinued Revere Ware in 2018. They ran it into the ground, until the brand name meant nothing. It's just really sad.	labels:[INVALID]	episode_done:True

text:How is sezane quality for you? Do they hold up?   I love the aesthetic, but both times I tried ordering from them, I was so disappointed with the feel of the fabric and thought I wouldn’t want to pay more than Madewell prices for the quality.	labels:It really depends what you get. My Sezane silk pieces are high quality for the price, especially during the archives sale. My 100% merino wool sweater is also super soft, warm, and pretty—as soft as cashmere but warmer and without all the pilling. I don't like the jeans and would avoid the viscose and polyester pieces. The shoes are overpriced; I have a few pairs that I got secondhand but I won't be buying any more. I have some good Sezane dresses too but they aren't as consistently good as the blouses. One thing I quite like about Sezane is that returns are free and easy, even during Archives sale. The customer service has been good in my experience too—if there are issues with your order, you usually get credit notes or free gifts.  The best quality pieces have just really thoughtful details—beautifully designed patterns, nice buttons, buttons up the back (so no gaping in front!), viscose (as opposed to polyester) linings, laces made out of cotton so they sit well and aren't itchy. It you like a tailored fit or have a very curvy body type the fit may not be idea. But I kind of like that tops are boxy/oversized because they fit my larger bust and shoulders, and I can just tuck them in for my preferred silhouette.  It's hard to describe how the pieces have held up over time because they are typically things I wear to work, and I haven't been to work in almost a year. I had one viscose dress that shrank, so I swore off the viscose! My silk shirts have done great with just hand washing. I have a wool coat that I got secondhand that has gotten very pilly, but I think that's just the fabric. I have had it for years, and there are no tears in the lining or loose buttons or misshapenness (issues I have had with many winter coats before). The linen is a little on the rougher side, but my linen pieces have kept their shape and the color didn't bleed with hand washing. I also have a secondhand pink cotton blouse that I put through the washing machine all the time and it still looks great.	episode_done:True
text:Brands that no longer live up to their name or quality	labels:This comes up here a lot, but many of the outdoors brands have turned into mostly fashion brands, and the quality has dropped as a result. The North Face, with the exception of a few of their collections (e.g. Summit); Columbia, and Mountain Hardware which they bought; and Marmot are some of the more famous examples.  Patagonia, Arc'teryx, Outdoor Reaearch, Fjallraven, and Kuhl are currently good alternatives, but I like to check the ultralight / camping subreddits for the most up to date info.	episode_done:True

My local thrift and consignment shops only have the recent, poor quality of items, but marked up because of the brand.	labels:Due to COVID, I am doing most of my secondhand shopping on poshmark and depop. You can get very good deals on vintage on poshmark, and it's a lot easier to find mid and plus sizes than vintage shops. Just include "vintage" in your search terms and look at product measurements. I thought I would never be able to find vintage jeans my size, until I realized that my modern size 12 is a 16/18 in 1980s vintage. Then I was able to find lots of denim.  When I go on road trips, I like to go to thrift stores in odd little places—they tend to be less picked over for the things I look for. You can also find good stuff at lower end vintage stores and vintage by the pound. There is a cute antique store that opened up near me with a vintage clothing room, and I got one of my favorite skirts there for about $25. It's a corduroy midi skirt from some western wear brand, probably late 1980s-early 1990s. Thredup doesn't really do vintage, but if you search brands you like regularly, you can get super good deals on nice brands. I got a basically new Ulla Johnson dress for $60. I am also in a few facebook groups for brands that I like for new resale.

text:Brands that no longer live up to their name or quality	labels:I'm becoming more and more disappointed with JCrew and will only buy their basic t shirts at heavy discounts. Eventually, the tops always end up with a hole and stretch out quite a bit.  I've not shopped at GAP in over a decade, but I still own a pair of sweatpants from them that are now 20 years old. Yes, That's how well they have been lasting. I doubt that the current ones would hold up that well.  Anthropologie pants also always end up with holes and stretched out. The tops always feel very cheap to me when I look at them in the store. Even buying on sale is becoming not worth it.  I have tried Sezane recently and am very pleasantly surprised at the quality from the feel of it. It remains to be seen how well the pieces hold up. If they do, I'm ok with spending the extra amount if it's  going to last a decade.	episode_done:True
text:What have people actually worn to funerals you've been to?	labels:I used to work in a funeral home and can tell you that I've seen it all. There will always be the guy that shows up in jeans and a barely nice t shirt, for some reason. There will always be a woman who shows up wearing a skin tight tiny club dress that barely covers her bum, but I guess she thought it was okay because it was black and also a dress? I've seen people wear sheer black clothing like somehow that's supposed to be a shirt. I've also been to funerals with wacky dress codes: everyone wears Hawaiian shirts or the everyone wears a chosen colour associated with the deceased.   But good rules to stick by: Wear clothes that are darker in colour; black, navy, dark green/purple. White dress shirts are appropriate, but having a jacket to go over it is ideal. If it's the summer and it's hot; boys, skip the jacket, but wear a tie and tuck in the shirt and girls, wear a flowy dress, ideally to the knee, with a light shawl or dress pants and a light blouse.   The purpose of the funeral is to pay respect to the deceased, and you want to keep the focus there. Wearing something too bright, or tight, or short, or casual can distract from what's going on and the importance of the funeral. The goal is essentially to blend in, not stand out, because the funeral isn't about anyone other than the deceased, so the attention goes to them. It's one of the few times that I believe everyone should put aside their own ego and allow the day to be about the deceased.
text:[INVALID]	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What have people actually worn to funerals you've been to?	labels:It’s depended on the person. In general it’s been “smart casual”, with women in mostly black dresses or black blouse and pants/skirt, and men in a button up (with or without tie) and black pants/jeans.   The last funeral I went to was for my partner’s grandfather; he was a big bold man who liked bright bold shirts and hated black. We wore the loudest shirts we could get our hands on, most were made by my MIL. True they were still button ups but they definitely shunned the traditional funeral wear.
text:That’s so cool. I love when funerals and memorial services have a distinctive dress code that honors the person being mourned.	labels:So do I, it was definitely the cheeriest looking funeral procession I’ve ever seen and we were all commenting on how much he’d have loved it. And honestly, we all felt almost *happy*, like we were celebrating his life rather than mourning his death. There were a lot of tears, but there were a lot of laughs and smiles. It’s hard to be glum when you’re in a bright yellow shirt, two sizes to big, with cacti printed all over it! It really was a beautiful way to remember him and send him off.	episode_done:True
text:What have people actually worn to funerals you've been to?	labels:In my experience it varies greatly on the family of the deceased and what they want. Most funerals I’ve been to have specifically stated a dress code required. Most of my wife’s family generally has a “dress like you’re going to a party” kinda vibe.  I usually split the difference if I’m unsure and just wear a grey suit 🤷‍♀️	episode_done:True
text:What have people actually worn to funerals you've been to?	labels:I think that if they are a NICE pair of BLACK jeans paired with a very nice shirt, it’s acceptable. But looking like you are going to a mall is just poor taste and a little insulting.   I had a friend who wore bright red skinny jeans, a brown “Domo” tshirt and black converse to a friends mom wedding. We all dressed up and she could have too. I’ll forever shudder at the thought of someone dressing like that for my wedding one day	episode_done:True
text:What have people actually worn to funerals you've been to?	labels:I went to a funeral after a death in the family and everyone tried their best to dress formal. We didn’t say anything about a dress code. It was just understood that this was a special and serious occasion. A few relatives flew in at the last minute and couldn’t bring much so they wore dress slacks and a collared shirt. One of my cousins needed to borrow formal clothing from another family member which just goes to show how much we all wanted to dress right for the occasion. It wasn’t all black but everyone tried to wear darker colors. The service was at the funeral home where our relative was to be cremated.	episode_done:True
text:What have people actually worn to funerals you've been to?	labels:It depends on the crowd, but at the last 3 funerals I went to, I wore a simple black sheath dress, black hose, and black flats, with one piece of jewelry.   I did see people mostly in what I would call "Sunday Best" and this ranged from skirts + heels to nice pants and a simple knit top. However these were all funerals for people who lived in a super small town their whole lives and were farmers most of their lives, so YMMV!	episode_done:True
text:What have people actually worn to funerals you've been to?	labels:I’ve been unfortunate enough to have been to two funerals in the past few years, and the idea of wearing all black to a funeral doesn’t really seem to be a thing in Australia. I wore all black both times because I thought that was what you were supposed to wear but lots of people wore casual clothing. I’m talking singlet (tank top), shorts and thongs (flip flops). I was very taken aback that people would wear that to a funeral but I guess them being there is the most important thing.
text:Im in aus and the last funeral I went too (for an elderly aunt) there were a group of early 20 year old women in melb cup crossed with club wear. They were cousins of cousins type thing.  I'm talking like orange neon body con mini mini dresses with the fake tan, huge fascinators, glittery platform stilettos. When they walked in they seemed to realise it was not appropriate and spent a lot of the church service trying to yank their dresses over their bums and looking awkward.   At my wedding my brother rocked up with holey jeans, a flanno and a bouquet of dead roses he got from the servo for free.   I'm from syd so maybe that's it because people from melb really out do us in the fashion stakes.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What have people actually worn to funerals you've been to?	labels:generally quite formal although in my family we don't tend to do black.

I've really loved them over the past few years (shout out old navy $12 sale!). I have a pair of what I guess you might call camp shorts? They're kind of cotton with an elastic waistband and deep pockets? I'd definitely buy more of those if they were cheap enough.   One thing I've been recently fascinated with is bellbottom overalls. They've got a few options on amazon, but they're 40 or so bucks and that seems a bit much for something that may be awesome or very dated/weird looking in actuality.   I don't anticipate they'll get around to my vaccine until fall if not later, so I'm not "dressing" for summer at this point. Even if I have to go back to the office my new job has a "wear whatever as long as you aren't indecent" policy.	episode_done:True

text:For the parents of girls	labels:As a daughter. My mom and I went shopping together. And we figured what would be appropriate for my age that we were both happy with. And then i would dress myself. My mom always says that i came up with some crazy choices. But it is part of your development. You figure out who you are through clothes.
text:Same, My mom would set outfits together in the closet at first but I would always mix and match so she eventually stopped at around 4 years old. As long as I had clothes on my body appropriate for the weather she let me do what I wanted (even from before I could actually put on the clothes on my own). Some days I would literally put on a clown wig with my clothes and my mom let me roll with it. I’m 24 now but we did a lot of shopping limited too and thrifting at the goodwill &salvation army. My sister and I were the same size in everything until after we graduated high school so we always shared a single wardrobe. I could pick out what I wanted (within reason) even from a really early age.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:For the parents of girls	labels:My mom and dad bought all my clothes until I got a job and started buying all my own stuff. My mom dressed me until I was about 9 or 10 and then I started picking my own outfits. My mom and I have very similar body types, but somehow my dad was, and still is, better at finding things that fit me nicely. My mom never really pushed her personal style on me and my sister, even though she bought and picked out 99% of our clothes growing up because it’s just hard to find little girls clothes that are the same style as women’s. My dad just liked to go in stores on a whim and ask employees what was in style at the moment, so he picked out some pretty good things.
text:I love that your dad was so involved!	labels:He still is! Even though my sister and I are 17 and 19 and have jobs, he still buys us things he finds on eBay for cheap when he’s bored at work. My sister and I love fashion now so we talk about it a lot and he has picked up on our favorite brands, the ones he remembers best are Free People and Zara. It’s so funny when he’s opening his packages of car parts and archery supplies and opens up a dress or jeans that he forgot he bought for us lol.	episode_done:True
text:For the parents of girls	labels:Have 14yo. She has had her own opinion in what to wear since she was about 3/4, and ever before that she hated dresses. And honestly, We just rolled with it. My parents were super controlling over what I wore, and I hated it.   So for her, we try our best to compromise. Like, you have to get dressed for school. Even if you are more comfortable in sweats than you are in PJs, we can compromise with athletic wear, but they have to be clean and fit correctly.   Now, in high school, she’s gone more towards skater/alt kid, which means she steals my clothes and shoes.	episode_done:True
text:For the parents of girls	labels:I have three kids, one girl, one boy and one trans-boy (13, 10, 15) who still dresses fairly feminine. My kids have always been allowed to pick their own clothes and style them how they want. Sometimes I give them advice on their fashion choices which they are free to ignore. They love my style and frequently steal stuff from my closet.  We don't have a lot of body type discussions in regards to clothes, because I don't want that to be their focus. I want them to focus on creativity and enjoyment of their clothes. Plus for my trans kid, their hourglass figure is a stressor for them. If they are struggling to style something, I help them out.	episode_done:True
text:For the parents of girls	labels:My daughter dresses herself, and chooses her own clothing. She is a whole and intact separate human being from me and has autonomy and her own sense of style. She is a late teen now, but this has been true since she has been old enough to put on her own clothing. In her middle school years she started altering her clothes, changing cuts and retailoring them to suit her taste.   I don’t make comments about her body or what I think she should do with it beyond staying safe and healthy.	episode_done:True
text:For the parents of girls	labels:I don’t have kids, but I really loved how my mom handled it, and plan to do something similar: I had a clothing “budget” for each year, and I was free to ask for money for anything I wanted as long as it fit into the budget (or I could use my pocket money). I just had to keep receipts, and subtract the cost when we got home. Besides cutting down on “you don’t really need this” arguments, I actually ended up learning some useful lessons from the process—in order to set my budget for the year, it was my job to figure out what I needed and lay out a proposal, which was negotiating practice (my sister and I competed to see who could get a bigger one approved!), and we had to use Excel to log everything. I might’ve whined a bit about the process in the moment, but now I see that it was a neat strategy, and I’m grateful for it.

text:For the parents of girls	labels:My daughter is two and while she loves helping dress me (I'll ask her what colour I should wear today and she'll have VERY firm opinions about that), she's still utterly indifferent to dressing herself and prefers to run around naked XD         I absolutely HATED how I was dressed as a kid (lots of home made clothes in my grandma's very questionable fabric choices... the clothes were cute, the fabric would be like orange and purple plaid or garish green and gold stripes (why grandma, WHY????), so I have a lot of name brand clothes for my daughter that I got second hand (gap, tommy Hilfiger, tea collection, persnickety, etc.) for like $2-5 a piece (FB marketplace is really good in my area - pre-covid, people would just invite you into their front hallways, drop bins of nearly new toddler and baby clothes in front of you, and then let you rifle through them and then charge you a flat price for each item you picked.  Found so much good stuff that way.)      I'm very much going to let her develop her own style and experiment from as early as she wants.  As long as she is weather appropriate, I plan on taking a supportive, hands off approach once she actually shows interest.    She has definite fit preferences now though (when I do dress her, leggings are a must - no jeans or wide legged pants).  She also hates long sleeves.	episode_done:True

text:For the parents of girls	labels:Mom of two little girls - 4 years old and 20 months old. The four year old dresses herself in whatever she wants. If it is not weather appropriate, I make her adjust (like a long sleeve shirt under a tank dress). She rarely matches but I think it builds independence, confidence, and creativity. She hates it when I ask her to wear something specific (like for a holiday) so I just try to buy special outfits we will both love. I let her pick out some of what I buy for her (give her some options to pick from). We shop mostly online so it’s easy for me to have some control over what she can choose.   The 20 month old pretty much wears hand me downs lol and I mostly pick what she wears but she’s starting to prefer to select herself (she’ll tell me “pick dress” in the morning to tell me she wants to choose a dress). I will let her pick her clothes more and more as she becomes more independent.   I imagine over time my girls will start to put together more and more fashionable outfits as they become more aware of style and what their peers are wearing. I will always let them choose for themselves and only intervene when what they want to wear is truly inappropriate for some reason. And even then I will continue to give them options for alternatives and let them choose. It’s their body after all!	episode_done:True

text:Negative Self-Talk re: Fashion Choices	labels:Oof, I definitely know those thoughts. I'm sorry your brain is being a jerk right now. <3  Something I've had some success with (and YMMV) is to constantly remind myself that "Clothes are supposed to fit ME, I'm under no obligation to fit THEM." If a pair of pants doesn't fit me comfortably, then the problem is with the pants, not my body. Items of clothing are inanimate objects and I owe them nothing. It's far from a perfect system and I don't always succeed, but it does help sometimes.  On a more practical front, have you considered using a tailor? From the problems you describe it sounds like you've got more of a waist-to-hip/leg difference than most brands allow for, and if that's the case, it's actually something that a tailor can fix pretty easily (and often relatively cheaply.) You would just buy pants that fit your legs comfortably and get the waist taken in. Fair warning, though: once you've worn clothes that actually fit you the way they're supposed to you'll never be satisfied with ill-fitting pieces again.	episode_done:True

text:Negative Self-Talk re: Fashion Choices	labels:not sure if this helps contribute to the conversation, but i gained a little weight during covid, which isnt the problem, the problem is that i was eating shitty food all the time. i went up in bra size and pants about 1-2 sizes.  &#x200B;  so i made a point to go through my pants/shirts (i wear alot of crop tops in warmer months) and put them into a bag and they go in the back of the closet until i want to try them on again.

text:Negative Self-Talk re: Fashion Choices	labels:I don't think there's anything wrong with preferring dresses and leggings and it doesn't inherently signify that you are somehow unworthy for pants or "letting yourself go".   The thing is, historically speaking, dresses were actually far more practical for a woman's body due the cyclical changes we all experience, from menstrual bloating/cramping, to minor weight fluctuations, to pregnancy and breastfeeding (historically there wasn't much choice about the last two but obviously now there is), cuz you could cinch up or let out your dress depending on how you were doing.   It's only now that stretchy fabric is truly mainstream that pants have truly become as practical and cost effective in that they can tolerate a lot more cyclical size changes, which are *normal*.  Edit: not to mention all the times people would gain and lose weight due to the availability of food.   I'd say I have a pretty confident mindset and 90% of my non work wardrobe is dresses and skirts/shirt combos. I wear undersummers in the spring and summer, leggings and sweater tights in the winter and I've gotten SO MUCH MORE USE out of my dresses... They lasted me up until my 8th month of pregnancy, I barely had to buy maternity clothes.  I have been able to wear the same knit dress/leggings combo at 180lbs prepregnancy and later at 210 lbs post partum and still look cute.  What pair of pants could pull that off? Almost none, I tell you.  Saved me a lot of $$$.   No matter what I weigh, I always have a bit of a belly, so most pants dig into that anyways, which isn't comfortable. Only truly high waisted stuff feels ok, but I don't want to wear that in the summer.   It sounds like disordered thinking is creeping up on you, and you may have to consciously remind yourself that there's nothing wrong with enjoying comfy clothes that don't restrict your abdomen.

I'd say I have a pretty confident mindset and 90% of my non work wardrobe is dresses and skirts/shirt combos. I wear undersummers in the spring and summer, leggings and sweater tights in the winter and I've gotten SO MUCH MORE USE out of my dresses... They lasted me up until my 8th month of pregnancy, I barely had to buy maternity clothes.  I have been able to wear the same knit dress/leggings combo at 180lbs prepregnancy and later at 210 lbs post partum and still look cute.  What pair of pants could pull that off? Almost none, I tell you.  Saved me a lot of $$$.   No matter what I weigh, I always have a bit of a belly, so most pants dig into that anyways, which isn't comfortable. Only truly high waisted stuff feels ok, but I don't want to wear that in the summer.   It sounds like disordered thinking is creeping up on you, and you may have to consciously remind yourself that there's nothing wrong with enjoying comfy clothes that don't restrict your abdomen.
text:I cannot thank you enough for this! I’m a huge history buff,and I’m really interested in fashion and costumes, so the whole historical explanation really resonated with me.  I hope I’m paraphrasing correctly, but I really like what you said about separating your preferences from body image,because ironicly, my fellow adhd-friends who have the same anti-pants sentiments as me are all pretty petite and thin. Also on another ironic note, I definitely have been the fittest i’ve ever been when I’ve let myself wear what I want and feel best in, it’s hard to have the motivation to work out and eat for your body when you are so dang uncomfortable!

text:Same! LOL. I have basically only used the outerwear I need for my outdoor weightlifting class. And really none of my actual items have gotten much use.   But I did get a wool blend long coatigan from J. crew with an abstract leopard print in the fall. This was a big hit. It pills a little like most knits. But it is super warm, and adds a little fun to a basic outfit. Each time I have worn it several people have appreciated it as well.  I anticipate it will be a winter staple.	labels:	episode_done:True

Did you add anything new to your winter wardrobe that stands out?	labels:I almost completely revamped my winter wardrobe this year and tried really hard to shop sustainably and thoughtfully. I had enough jackets (am currently rocking my mom's old leather jacket, a patagonia puff, and a mountain hardware insulated ski jacket depending on the day).   The big things I did add were 8 new tops (5 good, thick sweaters, 2 waffle long sleeves, and a hooded long sleeve). Everything I get was from REI or L.L.Bean. One sweater and one waffle shirt is an REI Co-op (their in house brand), an L. L. Bean, Icebreaker,  Patagonia, and Prana sweater, the other waffle was North Face, and the hooded long sleeve was Smartwool. I love them all and have gotten rid of almost all my other tops. They are so comfortable and can be worn in many ways.  My other big addition was Kamik Sienna mid duck boots in a coffee ish color. I am in LOVE with them. They look super cute with jeans and leggings and are well put together. I have worn them almost everyday in slush, snow, rain and my feet have never been cold. I can not recommend them enough. For Christmas I got my sister in law a pair of Kamik Rouge lo snow boots and everytime I've seen her (almost every weekend) she's been wearing them.	episode_done:True

Columbia Lay D Down II coat- light weight but warm enough to wear in below zero weather, nice big pockets, but wish the hood had strings to adjust width. When I put the hood up on a windy day I can’t adjust it so it just gets blown back down.  Artix snow pants- warm and can take a beating, very durable.

text:Review your winter 2020/2021 outerwear: how did your coats and sweaters hold up this season? Would you recommend your specific brand to someone looking for warm layers. Did you add anything new to your winter wardrobe that stands out?	labels:I am very sensitive to temperature changes so I suffer when I wear layers. Every time I come indoors, I need to strip off everything except a t shirt but I’ll be shivering my butt off the second I go out. Best solution was to get a thick and heavy parka. I have the Moose Knuckles Beaver jacket (discontinued now). It’s so warm that I can wear only a bra under it and still leave it half zipped in -25C.   I’ve been wearing it for 5 years now and the only signs of wear are on the slightly yellowed fur that used to be white, and the stretchy cuff where some threads are coming loose. The only reason this even happened is because I wrap my whole hand in it while writing on paper, so there’s more friction on them than with exclusively winter use. I’ve even gone skiing and snowboarding with it when the slopes were icy and had absolutely no issue. I was learning too, so I spent more time on the ground than upright. It’s been beaten up quite a bit but i can honestly say that it’s still in at least 8/10 condition. The fur is also great since it doesn’t get ruined at all. I’ve been rained on too many times to count in this coat but you just gotta dry it and it’s good to go.   Compared to my aritzia coat, I’d say that it’s not even half as warm as my moose. It also doesn’t last anywhere as long and I ripped through the shell after a slip on ice. I think it lasted me 3 years, but the fur on it was ugly at the start of the second winter season so it required a lot of upkeep it keep it looking in better shape.	episode_done:True

text:How did you find your style/tips for a cohesive style	labels:Anuschka Rees does a great job of explaining how to merge styles in one wardrobe:  “If you think about it, a style is nothing but a set of individual elements. To merge two different aesthetics, you need to break them up into their elements, carefully select exactly which of these you want to incorporate into your own style concept, and then figure out how to turn them into actual outfits.   *As a first step, you need to ask yourself which exact elements—colors, shapes, textures, specific pieces, details, and so on—of those two styles you want to be a part of your own unique look.* By doing this, you are reducing those big, restrictive top-level concepts into a simple set of tangible elements that are much easier to work with.”  For my wardrobe last year I wanted to add some typical cottage+cowboy style pieces, since I live on a farm now and it felt kind of fun. Using her method I broke down what I liked about the cottage/farm style into this: - patterns and colours: plaid, paisley, traditional embroidery, light colours, plant/animals print, fringe - materials: cotton, leather, suede, denim - items: flowy dresses + tops, cowboy boots, sandals   Using all of that I added the following items over the last year ish: - white embroidered denim jacket - black denim jacket with plaid lining - cowboy boots - flowy embroidered blouse - flowy paisley dress - embroidered jeans - fringe skirt  I usually have a tougher/punker look, so i can wear eg my plaid sundress with sandals + embroidered jacket for a countrier look, or I can wear it with my combat boots. I can wear my embroidered jeans with my embroidered blouse for a cottage look, or I can wear it with a colourblock sweater and ankle boots for a day in the city. It added a bit of feminine with the flowiness but also more of the masculine that I usually gravitate towards. Still really versatile!

text:How did you find your style/tips for a cohesive style	labels:Figure out what your signature thing is. It is fine to pull from a myriad of influences, and evolve over time.   I have found that over the years I have incorporated other things but I have some unofficial style signatures:  * probably something colorful or patterned * I love pointy flats * I like to add one casual thing to a nicer outfit and vice versa * I mostly wear skirts and dresses * I have a few outfit templates: dress plus cardigan or jacket, slimmer pant/looser top, longer skirt/shorter top or tucked (this is a new one) * bigger earrings in mostly metal and geometric shapes (I do not really do colorful jewelry) * I love sneakers with skirts and dresses (since I was a preteen)  After that most stuff is fair game. Most outfits follow one of my templates and incorporate my rules. Over time you’ll find your rules too.

text:How did you find your style/tips for a cohesive style	labels:I think it can be huge to just have a consistent color scheme, even if you wear different styles, if you do it all in similar colors then it will always look cohesive. It will allow you to combine more style-specific items together, like combining something vintage with something more modern, or something more edgy/rocker with something more frilly/soft.	episode_done:True
text:How did you find your style/tips for a cohesive style	labels:I've spent so much of quarantine trying to find my personal style! Here's what worked for me:  I got all the clothes I regularly, reliably wear, and I laid them out on my bed. Then, I wrote down some observations about them. The materials, the colors, the styles, the patterns...anything that seemed noteworthy. I realized I had three different color palettes going on, so I grouped them accordingly. After assessing everything, I tried to come up with a few adjectives to describe what I was looking at in front of me, and those adjectives became how I describe my personal style. In other words, rather than gravitating toward an aesthetic and trying to make my wardrobe fit into it, I just looked and described what my style, in practice, as it already exists, is.   And ever since I loosely nailed it down, now I make sure that any new clothes I purchase relatively fit those descriptors too. So everything I own is pretty stylistically compatible. :)	episode_done:True
text:How did you find your style/tips for a cohesive style	labels:Personally I’m still somewhat new too this but I’ve had many different fashion phases and have done many different looks throughout my three years of personal fashion experimentation. I feel the biggest thing that’s helped me is sticking to a sort of color scheme.    It’s definitely not for everyone necessarily but it’s helped a lot as I have grown my wardrobe, slowly adding more colors. It makes things very easy to match. I started with three colors ( I know that’s extremely little however) now I’m up to six!  I feel accessories ( not just jewelry necessarily but belts, hats , bags etc. ) are also very important to obtaining a certain look.   I feel organizing ones closet can also really help. There’s no specific way I’d necessarily recommend I organize mine by grouping items article then group them by color , as I mentioned color and matching things is very important to my personal style so that’s what makes sense for me.   Hope this could help some! I’m new at this too as I mentioned lol!

text:How did you find your style/tips for a cohesive style	labels:Who I am is not defined by my outfits. If I have very different styles on different days it really doesn't matter. There are days when I leave the house wearing a corset, hoop skirt and three layers of petticoats. There are days when I leave the house in jeans and a t-shirt. I am still the exact same person.  A fashion style cannot tell you who you are. You have to know who you are first.   As far as the practicalities of merging different aesthetics, my approach is that I have a spectrum of  "looking like an escapee from a medieval vampire brothel" to "average 2020s adult woman". I mix things up between those based on how much attention I want to draw and what I need to do for the day. It's okay if things are perfectly cohesive. Nobody cares that much about a slightly gothy accessory on an otherwise unremarkable outfit unless I draw from way on the goth end of the spectrum. I get away with wearing medieval kirtles on public and no one cares. I get away with wearing medieval kirtles and modern boots and hats and no one cares. I also get away with wearing cauls and suits. No one cares.  People don't actually pay that much attention to other people's clothes. Which means that you can get away with a lot and no one will notice. Clashing really isn't as big of a problem as people think it ism
text:I don't care how people see me, i want to feel good with what I'm wearing and i want it to be cohesive, but that's just my personal preference. I know people don't notice fashion inconsistencies because I don't and i also don't care much for what other people wear, i want everyonre to express themselves however they see fit. Of course, who i am is not defined by my outfits either but it is an expression of what i like and i have a hard time transforming that into the outside.

text:What rules do you break for your body type?	labels:I'm short, and one of the fashion guidelines I tend to read say to create long lines - this means avoiding ankle straps on shoes. I LOVE ankle straps on everything - heels, flats, sandals, etc. I definitely ignore this rule! Another rule I saw was to avoid the midi length since it can sometimes be too long but not long enough to be maxi. I wear my midi length skirts high-waisted so they fall at the right point and I love them. IDC if they make me look short, they're gorgeous!

Buy what you like, wear it were you are feel safe. You might start by just wearing it around your room. Taking selfies and such. Get a feel for how you wear the clothes for yourself. Eventually start pushing your boundaries a little. Be paciente with yourself  This will get easier as you get older, think of your age as an advantage for your adventure not a hindrance. Do the same thing with your body. When I was your age, I was self-conscious of my big butt and thighs. Now they are in style.  You are enough as is
text:Aw thank you :). You're really sweet. Maybe the age thing is an advantage because who when they are my age really knows/knew what they like lol.

That said, you can pull off any look you want to if you do the work! I actually find the egirl style pretty cute and I don’t think there is anything about being a fat WOC where the style wouldn’t be cute on you!  As for your family, this grinds my gears so much!!!! I’m old enough to be your mother and it makes me so sad when adults crush the creative expression of their children. You don’t have to ever fit in the box they want you to. As long as it makes you happy and you aren’t hurting anyone else, it’s your life to live and they are just clothes. If you can muster the courage to do it, have an open conversation about how your family makes you feel when they trash the style you like. Tell them it hurts and makes you struggle with self confidence in a world that already does that to fat WOC every day. I think if they get that it hurts you, they’ll stop being unsupportive.  Keep your chin up! It’s gets easier to give less of an EF what others think about you as you get older, I promise!	episode_done:True

You being a woc does not make you less badass, I am not a woc but you ladies are literally stunning as hell and your skin tone doesn't prevent you from being the baddest bitch in your block. So what if you're not a skinny white girl, it's not like a certain skin tone or weight determines whether you can be an egirl or not. You are capable to be the baddest egirl being woc and not beansprouty. I'm not sure what to tell you about your family, but I know a girl who would always put on something baggy over something revealing at home and before she left for school, then take it off. That could possibly be an option for when you get to go outside, or just dress like that in your room or something. When I started wearing clothes I thrifted instead of shopping at my small town's h&m or the other 3 fast fashion stores I thought I would get judged, but actually quite the contrary happened and I got compliments on my vintage clothes. I'm not exactly dressing edgy,more very colourful, but at least from people our age, they don't seem to judge edgy clothes. And honestly, when talking about strangers and not family members, I don't think anyone actually judges that hard. Seriously, why care anyway? Other than sorta needing to conform to social norms when looking for a job, like when you need professional pictures for a CV because egirl makeup isn't seen as "professional" or whatever, there's nothing you have to lose. You're not losing friends over glittery makeup and short plaid skirts, if anything, they might rather admire you for your cool new style. And strangers? They're strangers anyway, you won't ever see that mean ass grandma at the grocery store who frowned at your eyeliner ever again, it's not like you dress and do your makeup for her. You'll be a super pretty egirl, you can do that shit
text:Wow thank you for that reply :) that really made me feel better. I guess the stranger thing isn't something to care about honestly, you're right. But it's going to take me a longgg time to reach your level of confidence lol.	labels:I don't really feel very body confident, but honestly what's stopping us other than ourselves from being the baddest bitches, we have all the potential! Honestly I really appreciate other strange people's cool outfits when I see them on the streets. So, wear what you feel comfortable wearing, and if anyone shits on you for your choice of clothing, they don't really deserve your niceness anyway, they're not accepting how you want to express yourself and that is fucking shitty, but if anyone does, then wear whatever you like proudly just to spite their asses, likely they envy your boldness and your style anyway	episode_done:True
text:I want to be that bada*** biCTH (Ik it's spelt wrong, it's meme bro lol sry. Plus idk if we can swear, I don't post) tl;dr at the end cuz I tend to rant :)	labels:I'll start with #2. I started shopping for my own clothes around 16/17 . My family don't really care what clothes I buy with my money as long as my closet wasn't bursting at the seams.  I sometimes get the "are you really going to wear that/buy that" when they see me in something new. I remember buying a pair of wide legged, long jeans, and wearing sports bras as tops. Maybe it's because they saw how happy and comfortable I was in them that they didn't try to put me down for wearing stuff like that. What I buy is with my own money anyways, which does give me more confidence in some ways and probably helps them accept it too.  I know you mentioned ripped jeans -- I know some ripped jeans can cost, like, $150-$300 a pair. My advice would be to buy it with your own income (if that's possible, I know you aren't even 18/21 yet) and purchase things that you want to wear AND feel confident in wearing. It really sucks to spend money on items that sit around collecting dust.  My story with #3 is that people around me are either 1. creative energy or 2. dress with a similar vibe to me. I try to play a game -- if I'm going out in something "basic"/very messy, it's to blend in and likely not to talk to anyone that day. If I'm going out in something I love wearing, it's because I love it and I want to share it with the world. So I welcome the stares (and the questions). I try to match what I'm wearing to a purpose or mindset for that day. I value my own productivity more than how I'm being judged for something so shallow: my outfit. So my advice would be to find a purpose for what you're wearing, a purpose that is strong and way more important than how others might judge your outfit.  Honestly, I found that finding and building my style (which is really just a collection of stuff I will wear often) was a combination of having some financial independence and buying pieces that I loved to wear. Best of luck to you!	episode_done:True

You're becoming a negotiation between different people, rather than your own self. You're totally focused on your appearance and your clothes as a way to get confidence, but that isn't the way. Body image is not related to the way that you look; study after study has shown that even after drastic appearance changes, most peoples' body image stays the same unless they work on it in other ways. Aim for body neutrality, and focus your efforts on things that will actually give you some level of self confidence. Consider reading the book My Body Is Not An Apology and detoxing your social media from "self-improvement" accounts that are only focused on appearance under the guise of "wellness."   What's your 5 year plan to become independent? What are you doing to become involved in your community? What opportunities have you not considered for your future - from teaching English abroad, to artist residencies, to trade school, to university, and beyond? Whose advice have you sought out? What have you read, and who have you contacted? What inspiring WOC outside the entertainment industry, who are NOT self-help "gurus" or "wellness "inspo", do you follow on your social media? The only thing you have to do now is become who you are. Concentrate on figuring out your values, your hopes, your dreams, etc, in isolation of what other people think. This is hard to do, but it's possible.  Dress however you want. The most common outcome of a teenage girl going on a diet of any kind is that she becomes obese; studies have shown that when compared to overweight teenage girls not put on diets, overweight teenage girls put on diets are much more likely to become obese. Set up healthy habits for yourself, like going to bed at the same time every night and getting an hour of good exercise that you enjoy - whether that's an hour long walk, or walking and jogging, or yoga, or boxing. Literally whatever.	episode_done:True
text:What do you think about having a signature style vs. a variety of looks?	labels:I have three or four distinct styles. Most of the time I like wearing dark, edgy punk-inspired clothes. However, I’m a style chameleon. If I need to be professional, I have a whole separate wardrobe of high-quality suiting. Take out my piercings, and I’ll have anyone fooled that that’s the realest me. In the summer and family gatherings I often wear more earthy boho and beachy surfer looks. Fashion is a great tool for self-expression, matching the mood, and setting the mood.
text:I'm convinced that there's something deeper than just boho styled, edgy, punk, professional styled etc. that we find ourselves liking, that creates our style.   Like music. There's something deeper than simply genre that makes me like a song. It's not genres that define my music taste. It's a combination of all my songs I like that creates my taste.	labels:My favorite songs blend two distinct genres together, like metal and synthwave (with a sprinkle of rap?!). And my style I can't have distinct very well, never straight up punk, never fully professional (I firmly believe I am a professional because I work professionally - they can take my badass spreadsheets and perfect grammar, but they will also get my dyed and shaved hair and eclectic clothing). I have to blend them because there's so much I want to express! Yes, I am punk/emo, glam, neon, normcore all at once. I was probably inspired by my early childhood fascination with Queen, and then Danger Days as an adult. Eclectic doesn't even begin to cover it!	episode_done:True

text:What do you think about having a signature style vs. a variety of looks?	labels:I unrepentantly have four distinct styles: renfest/earthy boho chic (linens, lace, fancy sleeves, flowy skirts, harem pants, tunic tops, earthy tones, etc.), grandma incarnate (chunky knitted sweaters and dowdy but comfortable and sensible), cryptid/alien/paranormal theme (mostly tees/long sleeve tees with The Theme, bold bright colors and graphics), and artsy college girl (leggings and oversized shirts/sweatshirts, sometimes funky). There is no way to marry most of these styles and in fact they clash horribly but some days I feel like my Mothman tee and some days I feel like a forest fairy, and I will not be denied these benign little pleasures that make me smile.	episode_done:True
text:What do you think about having a signature style vs. a variety of looks?	labels:I guess I would say I do, because I don't "use looks/trends" I use shapes and colours that suit me and that fit parts of me i'd like to express.  And that does create a signature "look" without trying too hard because well.. I can't change my shape, and the colours that suit me are very defined within a colour palette.  I'm almost always wearing something stretchy that accommodates my body gently, and I like deep colours, soft colours and neutrals. I can have different elements (such as a romantic element, or a classy element) but the underlying fundamentals of "me" is there.  The problem with having different looks is that less pieces go together and some aesthetics don't really suit people as well as other looks might because the "structure" of the piece clashes with the person. I'm thinking of someone who might like sleek aesthetic inspired by 6 foot tall people, when they are more small and rounded, and it may be better to keep to their lines and add "touches of sleekness". Keep the air of sleekness but twist it in a way that suits them.. in other words, not "copy the aesthetic".	episode_done:True
text:What do you think about having a signature style vs. a variety of looks?	labels:I personally swing wildly between an academic honors student, vaguely retro, more gender-neutral street style, and then something a little more punk. I just wear whatever I’m feeling like wearing on a given day (or what weather dictates, occasionally), so I don’t consider it strange to have more than one style.

So if you have not washed something in a darker color before, absolutely wash it by itself before tossing it in with whites! If the underwear is delicate, a delicates or lingerie bag is a good (reasonably inexpensive) investment, though I’d still be wary of tossing them in with anything denim or generally rough (t-shirts or blouses are fine).

text:I'm with you on the unscented detergent bit. They put WAY too much fragrances in them and they all make me gag.  I do a lot of hand washing, too. Many years ago, I ran out of Woolite and had to use shampoo...it works great. It gets hair clean, so it is a cinch to get clothes clean without an offensive amount of fragrance.

Shirts, bottoms, skirts, dresses--- Usually 3-4 times depending on use.  Skirts-- 5-6 times (these don't touch the crotch area so they don't get as dirty as other bottoms).  Outer layers (sweaters, sweatshirts, etc)--- As needed (I always have something under these).  PJs-- 3-4 wears  Sheets-- Every 2 weeks or so  Towels-- Washcloths-- after each use (I use two a day to wash my face), body towel-- after about a week.  Hair towel-- when I remember to (I only use this towel for my hair and wash my hair twice a week).  Hand towels, dish towels, etc-- as needed.

text:How does a warm weather wardrobe differ from a cold weather wardrobe?	labels:I moved from the Midwest to Atlanta. If it’s a similar climate dont get rid of all your winter clothes! I got rid of so much thinking it would be warm year round but it still gets really cold about 3 months out of the year. I kept one good winter coat as well. Also because you get used to the warm weather high fifties/sixties can feel wayyyy colder than it should
text:it's New Orleans! i'm moving from Maine	labels:That is so exciting! New Orleans could not be more different than Maine, but I hope you love it. I move from Oregon to Texas, and it was a huge adjustment, but now I really like it here.  Like the other commenter said, keep a coat and a few sweaters. When it’s “cold” here, it actually feels colder to me than when I lived in the North. The summer is pretty brutally hot, so I only wear natural fibers now (polyester makes me very sweaty), and lots of short and dresses. No jeans in the summer at all. You do need something to put on when you go inside because of the A/C, but don’t be like me and think you can still wear sweaters in the summer in the South like I did in Oregon.  Have so much fun! Moving to New Orleans is worth it for the food alone.  Edit: This is not weather-related, but the biggest difference to me between northern and southern dressing is that in the South, women generally look way more polished than in the North. I’ve been in Texas long enough now that when I go to Oregon, I’m always thinking “Why doesn’t anyone take care of themselves up here?” Haha just something to keep in mind...	episode_done:True
text:How does a warm weather wardrobe differ from a cold weather wardrobe?	labels:I live in Austin where the heat and humidity get prettyyy ridiculous. I pretty much live in skirts and shorts in the summer time. Tops-wise, I'm usually in short sleeves. If I'm daring to wear anything that doesn't show skin, it's loose and flowy!      No matter what clothes I wear, I think fabric makes the most difference. Polyesters and chiffons are the most miserable to wear in the heat and humidity because they're not breathable at all. Cotton and natural fibers all the way.      Hope that helps!

text:it's New Orleans! i'm moving from Maine	labels:Awesome!! I’m not familiar about their winter weather but I assume it’s quite similar that you’ll want to keep sweaters and at least one coat just in case. Something you won’t need that I brought was heavy winter boots! You’ll be happy to say goodbye to those. As for your ac comment, I keep a sweater at work because it can get cold (I work an office job) but I normally wear dresses in the summer so I can go outside on walks without sweating	episode_done:True
text:How does a warm weather wardrobe differ from a cold weather wardrobe?	labels:New Orleans is super humid all summer. Dresses, shorts, and athletic/moisture wicking fabrics will be your best friend.   You’ll be able to get by with one coat that you may never wear. I have pictures of me at Mardi Gras (in February) in short sleeves and jeans, perfectly comfortable.   Light cardigans for going inside are a great idea for southern summers. They have to blast the AC just to control the humidity.   It’s also important to consider what that humidity will do for your hair!
text:good point! i have wavy/curly hair in cold/dry weather so it will poof right up!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How does a warm weather wardrobe differ from a cold weather wardrobe?	labels:I used to live in the southwest and wore sundresses almost exclusively. Even maxi dresses would leave me with sweat dripping down my legs. But the AC would bring it back down to reality and I’d be wearing cardigans inside. Loose weave, 3/4 sleeves, or baggier are good calls.	episode_done:True
text:How does a warm weather wardrobe differ from a cold weather wardrobe?	labels:I wear a lot of dresses, skirts, and wide-leg flowy pants during the summer. I almost never wear shorts because I've always hated them. Breathable fabrics are important especially with humidity; you'll be a lot hotter in polyester than in cotton. Also thigh chafing is a thing, so I like to alternate between days I wear a skirt and days I wear loose pants.   I do tend to carry a lightweight top layer for air conditioned buildings. But it doesn't need to be something super warm; mesh or a loose weave is fine. I tend to like that layer to be something that won't wrinkle so I can toss it in my purse.	episode_done:True
text:How does a warm weather wardrobe differ from a cold weather wardrobe?	labels:As someone who moved from Boston to Houston - leave your LL Bean behind.  You don't have to spend a fortune on new clothes (target is fine).  Women do not tend to wear khakis down here.  Loose linen pants would probably feel good though.  Colors will be brighter, bring sunglasses.  New Orleans will be a swamp most of the year, so whatever you would pack for a beach vacation.  You don't need snow anything (shoes, coat), maybe a light jacket for the colder months.  I didn't use my wool coat for a couple years, it wasn't cold enough.  You could probably get away with a wool sweater and layers under if it dips to the 30s and you're still acclimated to cold weather.  Yes to a light cotton or linen cardigan for the AC.  Do not underestimate the heat and humidity.	episode_done:True
text:How does a warm weather wardrobe differ from a cold weather wardrobe?	labels:Having a heavier coat on hand isn’t a bad idea, especially if it’s already available - but for context I grew up in Austin, TX and the *only* winter coat I ever had I purchased specifically for a vacation. There’s an odd day every couple of years where you might want to use it... but for the most part people just stay inside and the weather warms up.  Things like a lighter fleece will take care of you pretty well on the coldest typical winter days.   A big thing I would recommend is a lot of light layers that are easily removed - cardigans, button ups, jean jackets, whatever. They served me well year round, even on the hottest days. I’m not sure specifically about New Orleans, but it’s pretty common to run the air conditioning really intensely in that part of the country (I swear my high school was kept at 50 degrees year round) and being able to cover my arms indoors was important to my comfort. Basically just something that’s light and easy to store away when you’re in the heat.	episode_done:True
text:How does a warm weather wardrobe differ from a cold weather wardrobe?	labels:I also live in Louisiana. You definitely want to have a pair of rain boots or waterproof shoes because of how much it rains in the spring and summer evenings. I have a pair of cute Chelsea boot style rain boots that are a lot easier to style. Also, get a pair of good quality sandals that are comfortable, I prefer Birkenstock’s.   I strictly wear shorts or mini skirts in the spring, summer, and most of fall, then jeans or leggings/joggers in the winter. I have denim shorts, chino shorts, and some cute dressy shorts, depending on the occasion.   I don’t really like dresses because it’s hard to find summer dresses that aren’t sleeveless, and I just prefer to have some kind of sleeve.   I personally would get too hot wearing a sweater in the spring/summer, and I am very cold natured, but I keep a lightweight jacket in my car in case I go somewhere and the AC is really cold. I am not really big on tank tops, so I just wear a lot of short sleeve tops. I don’t even rotate my tops because I will usually just wear the short sleeved ones under a jacket in the winter, and I only have like 3 sweaters anyway.   Also not big on hats, personally, and the only time I see other people wearing them are for photo shoots or going to the beach. However, I do recommend some nice sunglasses.

text:How does a warm weather wardrobe differ from a cold weather wardrobe?	labels:Lots of good comments already so I'll just say plan for one additional layer in the summer when you work in a professional AC environment. I used to live in sleeveless shirts and dresses in the summer for commuting in my miserably hot car and the walk to and from the building, during lunch, after work.  Then I'd throw on a blazer or a cardigan once inside.	episode_done:True
text:Using Pinterest to Help Find Your Style (or: how to tell Pinterest it is no longer 2012)	labels:I also think something that really helps me is when I find something I like, I scroll down to look at the “similar items”.

text:Using Pinterest to Help Find Your Style (or: how to tell Pinterest it is no longer 2012)	labels:Great tips, I definitely have not been using the "More Ideas" button to its full potential.    I've been trying to pin fashion and style again, and I find I really miss the website Polyvore.  I never used it, but the ease with which other people made outfits and shared them meant that there was always something new to pin.    I follow a few fashion bloggers who seem to be popular, but I sometimes forget the work that goes into doing a blog post, styling things just right, taking the photos, etc.  Not to mention buying the clothes!  With that old Polyvore website, users were pushing out complete outfits everyday.  I hope something like that comes back around again soon, because I found the flat lay design of the pins easy to identify with.  With real people or models, I start to worry about whether something would work with my proportions, what kind of style tips they're using, etc	episode_done:True
text:Using Pinterest to Help Find Your Style (or: how to tell Pinterest it is no longer 2012)	labels:This is really helpful, and detailed. A lot of effort went into this! I am fascinated by how clear and organised your approach is.   I would use pinterest in a different manner more a style "mood board" than practical.      * So I might have events or things I am desiring (like a manifestation board). I desire to perform this year for example, so I have board for dancing style inspiration and a new board for each vision * Then I have a board for my "colours"; I am a Summer (cool season), so I have a board of colours and combinations that inspire me, such as baby blue and creamy white * I have boards with different themes, such as renaissance, vintage, exotic/seductive and in those boards I place pieces or photos that evoke those moods.	episode_done:True
text:Using Pinterest to Help Find Your Style (or: how to tell Pinterest it is no longer 2012)	labels:Thank you for the in depth breakdown! I actually use Pintrest for most of my fashion finding needs and I've been in the habit of reworking my algorithm often. As soon as I start getting recommended a bunch of things I don't like I start unfollowing boards and abusing the hide button like crazy. I also went through and organized all my boards with the new subcategory option to combine a lot of my boards together.   Another note that might help people is if you can't figure out why your still getting recommended out of date pins, go back into your boards that your feed recommends from and delete the older pins that you no longer like. I went back into all my fashion boards and went to the pins I'd pinned when I first got into Pintrest (in like 2012) that were definitely no longer my style. Once those were no longer there to draw from my feed changed pretty dramatically.	episode_done:True

I’ve been using some of this for a while, and have been looking for ways to go from smart casual to a more business casual, and found a new person who tends to dress in a way which fits with my established comfort zone but with more of a leaning towards where I need to go (workplace with strict dress codes for professional and hygiene reasons). I know virtually nothing about this figure as a person or platform and don’t want to name them as I don’t know how I’d feel about them if I did. But their style? Perfect for my needs, and something I likely wouldn’t have come across otherwise.	episode_done:True

text:Goals and Resolutions Check in: February	labels:My goals are going well! A couple of ours are essentially the same. Good luck, we got this!  1) Wardrobe Overhaul  At the beginning of the year, all I owned was athleisure. I was a very cozy, but very bored, person. So I’m working on filling my wardrobe with clothes that really make me happy, and it’s working! I’m in a fortunate position right now, so I’ve been spending the last stimulus check on ThredUp and Poshmark. I gotta say I am loving online thrifting.  2) Dress for my emotions rather than comfort.  Part of moving away from athleisure. My clothes really influence how I feel, so dressing up to look like a badass bitch makes me feel like a badass bitch. Even on days I work at home, I wear outfits to emotionally prep myself to enjoy being productive. I change into pjs when my work is done for the day, so I actually get to look forward to my comfy clothes rather than feel like it’s just another lazy day in leggings.  3) Focus on fit and proportions.  This one is harder but is making me feel the most ~fashionable~. I’m trying to identify how/why certain pieces work on me while others look slightly off. I take videos of myself where I make a bunch of tiny adjustments to my outfits to identify the little details I do or don’t like. This is definitely the biggest of my goals, and will take a long time to really figure out. I can often tell when something isn’t right about an outfit, but identifying that element is tricky.

text:Goals and Resolutions Check in: February	labels:Later last year, I decided to go a year without buying clothes (with a few exceptions, e.g. if I end up getting a job that requires things I don’t have), so my style lately has been about making use of things I own. Last month, my goal was to spend time mending an article of clothing every week, and I’m happy to say I’ve salvaged a few things and improved my sewing! This month, I’m learning about embroidery. I want to add subtle decorations to pants.  The struggle is wanting to splurge on cute things. :( Another: sewing is time-consuming, but I often do it while I watch TV.  It’s cool to hear about your goals! I care about sustainability, too.
text:Thats really awesome! I hope you have a good embroidery journey this month - that is definitely on my desire list this year as well. I have a jean jacket that I would love to embroider with the national parks I visit. I have a design in my mind and everything but it’s intimidating.  I also get the struggle of wanting to splurge on cute things or find time for sewing. I’ve tried to mend or embroider while watching tv but my lighting is terrible (that or my eyes are aging).

Hardly anyone even wears wooden shoes anymore. :p   BUT we had a tradition of fishermen's sweaters/ganseys, and I actually have a photo of my greatgrandfather wearing a gansey with the motive of his village (I researched it) which I intend to knit my own version of. So if that counts, then yes!	episode_done:True
text:Anyone like wearing traditional clothing from you culture?	labels:I also love wearing my cultural wear! I was born and raised in the US, but my parents are from Vietnam. Our traditional dress is the áo dài, and I just think it’s so beautiful. It’s such an elegant piece of clothing and literally makes any girl look good, no matter what size or shape you are. I’d love to wear it as part of everyday wear, but it looks a bit formal for most occasions. I have seen some more modern versions and a bit trendier versions, so I’m trying to get my hands on that. As for now, I just wear my cultural dress to church on Sundays, which is a more appropriate setting.  But I wouldn’t worry yourself about what your mom has to say about it. If it you like it and it makes you feel good, then why not wear it? I bet you look amazing in them, it sounds so cute!

I find it a fun challenge to make them look modern in the way I style them, for example tucked into corduroy palazzo pants that have the same color as the embroided flowers.   I’m Dutch myself (my partner is Mexican), and traditional clothing here has kinda died out. The only thing I still use are my clogs as quick slip in shoes whenever I’m going into the garden, very practical haha	episode_done:True

text:Dressing for “housework” vs “working from my house”	labels:I've been a SAHM for 12 years now, and I learned early on that it was easiest for me to get up each morning like I was going to work, shower, and get ready for the day (do my hair and makeup). That means I'm prepared in case of an emergency or something unplanned. My uniform is jeans and a "cute" top. Right now, my kids are doing virtual learning, so I'm running around helping them, plus fixing their lunches and snacks, in addition to my normal chores and errands.   My favorite shoes are Gabor loafers, which I have in several colors. And I just purchased a pair of Dansko Nora loafers. They are super comfortable, lightweight, and have great support. I typically go barefoot at home (which is why my Bombas wear out), but I walk my dog every day and these are great for that.  I really love having a uniform, and I have several pairs of the same style jeans, and multiple tees in different colors and styles. If I have to leave, I can throw on jewelry, grab my bag, and I'm ready to go. I was a teacher previously, and having a system works for me at home. Huge hugs to all the moms doing double duty right now!	episode_done:True

text:My feet started to ache a lot from standing all the time barefoot.  Before the pandemic, my shoes were off at the door and my house was quite shoe-free.  Since the pandemic, I wear shoes for like 4-5 hours a week instead of 50 hours a week and my feet need more support.  I designated a pair of my "regular" shoes to be house-shoes for the foreseeable future because I need support and structure for my feet.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Another vote for apron, with a suggestion to look up japanese cross back aprons. They provide great coverage, stay on without restricting movement and don’t fit tightly at all, so they work with multiple outfit profiles and multiple wearers.   There’s kind of a trick to putting them on quickly but once I got it it’s faster than the tie-on aprons I had to wear for work (and I wasn’t slow with those, either!)	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Dressing for “housework” vs “working from my house”	labels:For the most part, my WFH clothes are versatile and can be worn for housework/lounging/telework.  I don't wear shoes indoors, just cozy slippers.  In general, my work-from-home wardrobe consists of things like wide-leg soft pants, cozy-but-washable sweaters, washable knit dresses, and jeans and a blouse for days that I'm feeling fancy. These are all things that I'm comfortable doing light housework in, e.g. cooking/dishes/laundry. Sometimes I'll throw on an apron over top if I'm doing something that might splash.  But one rule with all of my clothing is that I don't buy things that aren't easy care/machine washable. I have a lot of environmental allergies, so I need to be able to thoroughly clean things if they're exposed to pollen/animal dander/etc. And the bulk of my clothing falls into the range of mid to dark colors, so nothing's likely to stain.  Now, if I'm going to be doing heavier housework (e.g. scrubbing the bathtub, deep-cleaning the stove, anything gardening, anything involving bleach or paint), I'll put on old sweatpants and a tee. But that's the exception rather than the rule.	episode_done:True

It's easy to forget about shoes for a while until one day you're making weird pleasure/discomfort noises while putting them on because it's been too long since you've had adequate support.	episode_done:True
text:Thrifting lovers, what are your favorite thrift stores?	labels:Goodwill totally depends on the area. I'm from a college town and their Goodwill has amazing stuff, probably because there isn't a consignment store in town so they get everything. I live in a big city now and the Goodwills are completely picked through and don't have many trendy items but I would still go to find jeans to turn into cut offs or something. Buffalo Exchange is a consignment store so they don't accept anything damaged or dated, but its a little more expensive. I recommend Poshmark for workout clothes because you can search by brand and size. I buy shoes at Goodwill and don't have a problem since usually you can tell if they're heavily used or not.
text:My local goodwill is sooo overpriced! You’re so lucky! We have a local consignment shop run by my friend's mother and it is awesome, but I think they’re suffering due to the pandemic (the shop is very small and jam-packed).  I really want to check out the GW bins, too! It's definitely on my post-pandemic bucket list	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Thrifting lovers, what are your favorite thrift stores?	labels:Unfortunately the thrift stores where I am tend to not be worth my time. Last time I went they wanted $16 for a pair of used Target brand shorts that retail for $24 new. No thanks.  I've been thrifting on Poshmark and eBay for years and have always had good luck there. Having to pay shipping on every item kinda sucks but I figure that's the price I pay for having access to thrifted items from across the country/world and not just whatever's available locally.	episode_done:True

text:Thrifting lovers, what are your favorite thrift stores?	labels:It really depends on your area. My favorite in my town in Salvation Army. You really just have to check all the ones in your area out and decide for yourself which has the best selection and prices. Also, figure out which days they do sales (my SA has a color tag for 99 cents on Fridays) and plan trips strategically. I moved from a city to a small town and at first was really disappointed in the thrifting since I rarely find modern brand name items, but the prices are way better, there is lots of great vintage, and I feel like there are less 'trendy' people shopping for the same style of items as I am.   So it also depends what you're looking for!	episode_done:True
text:Thrifting lovers, what are your favorite thrift stores?	labels:I'm a big fan of going local if you can. My city (Richmond, VA) has a place called Diversity Thrift that funds the local LGBTQ Community Center. You have to dig sometimes and I don't know what it's been like since covid but I've found some amazing, unique pieces there.

text:Thrifting lovers, what are your favorite thrift stores?	labels:Mostly I just go to Value Village (which I believe is affiliated with Savers) and goodwill. There are one that are more curated like Buffalo exchange and Platos closet, but i usually just stick to VV and goodwill.   Largely with these thrift stores the location of the store is what matters. Bigger cities/nicer areas you’re more likely to get donations of nicer quality items.   I buy a lot of my shoes from thrift stores, but it often takes a lot of searching before I find ones that aren’t beat up and worn.

text:Thrifting lovers, what are your favorite thrift stores?	labels:My local Goodwill, is... adequate.  I've found some decent things, there but nothing amazing; it's overshopped, but one could find good things if one went regularly. There's a spot on the far side of town that's a great for, like, furniture and winter coats, but I don't hit it often.  We had a Salvation Army but it was, like all the other Salvation Armies in the area, incredibly terrible and I'm not sad it's gone.  The best spot in my town is the Hospital Thrift store.  It gives serious 'little old lady' vibes, but also consistently has very wearable, quality items as well as cool, funky stuff that's nice to look at.  Bonus is that it's tiny  (Covfefe restrictions have pushed the store limit to 10,) so digging around doesn't take long and is well worth the effort.	episode_done:True

text:Knee-high boots, classy heels, or trendy sneakers?	labels:Well I have been wearing sneakers with dresses/skirts on a regular basis since I was around 13 or so. Typically minimal types or when I was way younger even Keds. I am 42 now so that is like 30 years.   I also like pointy flats and those are a more walkable and polished option - and have been doing so since my early 20s. I also like ankle boots and have also been wearing those since my 20s.    These 3 are the shoes I wear the most - pointy flats, ankle boots, and sleek sneakers. I wear a lot of flats - those get the most use. The other two are regulars that can be a bit more seasonal.  In the before times it would be something like 4-5 days a week with flats and 2-3 days of sneakers. And in the winter or rainy season the boots replace the flats for many days.   I do not do heels very often and have been swapping out the ones I have for block heels since they do not get messed up on sidewalk grates. I love a slingback or mule so those are the styles I get the most.   I do not do knee high boots for a myriad of reasons.

Personally I love align leggings for everyday (knowing that they will eventually pill... but for me at least, usu more like a year or two in), fast & frees for lightweight running/spin (pockets!!!) and wunder unders or wunder trains for more of a sleek compressive feel (probably the best at achieving the slimming look you’re going for?).

Aligns are very popular, I love them they don’t slide down and are very smooth, however the quality isn’t as great. Wonder unders are popular too but they come in two fabrics that are very different from one another so you need to watch for that. The ones mentioned above with the side pocket and draw string are invigorates I like these but I find they slide down.
text:The issue with Aligns isn’t the quality. It’s the fact that it’s one of their most delicate fabrics. Most people wear them for workouts, and they’re really only designed to withstand light yoga.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:The best of basics: Black Leggings	labels:Coldwater Creek brand. Have worn/washed them at least 150 times and no fading. Excellent quality fabric, found another pair on eBay.	episode_done:True
text:The best of basics: Black Leggings	labels:Depends if I plan on always wearing something over them or not, but one of my favorite pairs is from Nordstrom, Halogen brand. The fit is perfect and the fabric is stretchy and durable enough to be slightly slimming. I've had them for years and they look brand new no matter how many times I wash them.	episode_done:True
text:The best of basics: Black Leggings	labels:The brand from TJ Maxx with a ballerina on the logo. $14-$25 for leggings, and they have super unique variations! Not exactly high end, but great when you’re unemployed and ballin’ on a budget!	episode_done:True
text:The best of basics: Black Leggings	labels:Athleta’s Salutation legging in 7/8 length! I don’t like any more compressive feeling leggings, but lululemon Aligns are also a bit too soft and non-supportive feeling; the Powervita fabric on these is soft but also hugs so better for the ass lol. Also, I don’t like leggings that cover my ankles, and the 7/8 length is just right, though they also have full length. Also good if you want mid and high rise and pocket/no pocket options.   Someone else commented about Athleta’s Elation legging, and I’m not sure what the difference is between these two styles, but they’re both made out of Powervita fabric.	episode_done:True
text:The best of basics: Black Leggings	labels:Honestly lululemon. Find a pair that fit you well and with all the features you want and you’ll never turn back. Leg pockets and waist drawstring for me.

text:What are your not-so-basic basics to pair with statement pieces?	labels:I have a teal suit that is similar in brightness to your pink one. Some tops that would work/that I think work with my suit are: - white/cream button down - white/cream turtleneck - turtleneck or mock neck in a shade lighter or darker than the suit for a monochrome look - silver (for mine) / rose gold (for yours) colour camisole or shoes  - lacy bodysuit + heels - graphic tee + sneaker for a casual streetwear look (I don’t really like wearing sneakers with suits but lots of people like the look)  You can also simply wear the pieces separately!! I tend to wear my blazer a lot more than my pants.	episode_done:True
text:What are your not-so-basic basics to pair with statement pieces?	labels:I'm a fan of combining bold pieces with more bold pieces. They say less is more, but I believe the inverse is true too: more is less. Meaning that when a piece feels like it's "too much," it can often help to add other "too much" pieces to balance it out and create a more intentional look.   The pink suit would rock with a base layer in red, light pink, tan/brown, or even a print or stripe if the mood strikes.
text:I think the print idea would be great! Also tan with pink is a color combination I wouldn't have thought of! thank you	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What are your not-so-basic basics to pair with statement pieces?	labels:For the pink suit, I think it would look great with any kind of tutleneck. Black could be safe, but if you really wanted to go mad you could go for a green or bright blue. it would look so fun.   The top I think would look really fun layered over a form fitting tube dress and then paired with some flat trainers.   The jacket would elevate anything for sure, byut what's stopping you just trying on a load of outfits you have and testing them out in the mirror? Have a fashion show!	episode_done:True
text:What are your not-so-basic basics to pair with statement pieces?	labels:Pink and burgundy can be a great combo. Pink and charcoal gray is one of my favorites.

text:What are your not-so-basic basics to pair with statement pieces?	labels:For the suit, I'm picturing a hot pink crop top underneath to go for a full monochromatic look, but with some more minimalist heels.  I've definitely seen a light/hot pink outfit before and thought it looked bomb.  As for the organza pink top, it would look lovely with some true black straight leg jeans and silver heeled pointed toe boots or nude strappy heeled sandals with your hair up in a bun and silver hoop earrings.	episode_done:True

text:What are your not-so-basic basics to pair with statement pieces?	labels:I usually wear one statement piece with more basic items, but if I want to combine more dramatic items, I try to pick items that stand out for different reasons (unless I'm going for full on maximalist).   So like with the pink suit, it's 100% the colour that makes it stand out. So I would pair it with a top with a bold pattern, or a dramatic scarf that creates an interesting silhouette, or a belt or necklace that has a lot of interesting detail.

text:What are your not-so-basic basics to pair with statement pieces?	labels:Actually i woould pair it with a black turtleneck as well. I got a pink tweed skirtsuit and i love the bold pink and black contrast. I have plenty color too and i am interested in what people think. I also paied it with lacy black body suit.  I m also doing plain cropped woven shirt but so far only black and white tops. Will be interested to see more answers.
text:now I too want a pink tweed skirtsuit to wear with a turtleneck to give those dark academia meets clueless vibes! love the ideas	labels: I thought sabrina meets clueless! So we re in the same boat!	episode_done:True
text:What are your not-so-basic basics to pair with statement pieces?	labels:I always like a graphic pattern. Maybe with 2-3 colors (like polka dots or something abstract). Or a graphic tee shirt. The pink suit can act as an almost neutral.    I do not love light pink paired with dark colors - so I’d pick something leading with a light color. Or a graphic pattern that is bright or light.   If your suit is hot pink or darker - I love mustard and bright pink. It is a really fun combo. Green is pretty classic. As is grey. Cobalt blue can be nice with a saturated pink. You could do tone on tone with another pink top.

It’s cheap crap made by underpaid and exploited workers so we can wear it for a month and be thrown in a landfill. It drives me crazy that influencers constantly advertise clothes from cheap retailers because I know they are getting the outfits for free/are getting paid to post about them. The loungewear sets are thin and warp when you wash them. The dresses are paper thin. Bathing suits feel like they’re going to fall apart. But they say “omg look how cute!” for a buck.   They also advertise the Walmart delivery service saying “omg, ordered this from Walmart 2 hours ago and it’s already here!”   If they were advertising quality clothing from sustainable companies that’s a whole different story.	episode_done:True

text:How many clothes do you have? (Really?)	labels:I think the size of your wardrobe is going to depend on your climate, job, hobbies, and general lifestyle. I have a lot more clothing than that. I also live in a place with four seasons. I have outdoorsy hobbies that require some tougher clothes. I can‘t wear my casual clothing to work (and I’m also holding onto some more professional clothing from a past job in case I return to that field). I don’t have a lot of disposable income either, so I always keep things like dress pants even though I never wear them in my everyday, because I can’t afford to go shopping when interviews and funerals come up.  For instance, I probably have at least 15 dresses alone, once you count all the strappy sundresses, nice work dresses, wool sweater dresses, the cocktail dresses, and the evening gown that’s in the back of my closet - and everything in between.  I swap out my clothing with the seasons and have one closet that I share with my husband, so I try to be judicious about what I keep, while giving myself grace that I don’t need to get rid of something just because I don’t wear it regularly.
text:Living in a place that has a cold winter and a hot summer makes a capsule wardrobe pretty much impossible.

text:I mostly try to use the same clothes across hobbies, though maybe I can get away with this because I don't need specific clothes for hobbies.   For me summer is super thin wool. Fall and spring I add on a lightweight wool or puffer jacket. Winter I wear both the puffer and wool jacket and a rain coat to block the wind. Though I am worried about having too many clothes, so I was very careful about being able to layer across seasons. Having one coat for each season would be the problem for me. Having multiple that I can layer and get use throughout the year is fine.   I have a little linen that can be added in here and there for purely aesthetical reasons, worn between the lightweight wool and warmth layers.  I also work in tech, so it is all t-shirts and jeans, so I'm usually the one who is "over" dressed. I pretty much only work, hike and lounge at home. So everything I do is "casual." I haven't been to even a business casual event in over 6 years. So yes, lifestyle definitely means I just don't need many clothes.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What is your favourite item from a discount brand?	labels:I have a 10+ year old floral dress from Kohl’s. It magically works for any occasion, doesn’t wrinkle, and needs no special care.

text:Not familiar with kohl’s as I am in Canada. What other brands would they be akin to ? Dress like that sounds amazing!	labels:Kohl’s is a low to mid tier department store. A bit like Target without the food/toilet paper stuff, and lower end than Macy’s. Fancier than Walmart. But it is like the unhip middle age mom suburban store - so you are supposed to be embarrassed to shop there. 🤣🤣🤣  Now in retrospect, I might have actually bought this dress when I was still in my 20s, barely! And now I am 42.   They have a wide mix of “exclusive” brands, and mass market ones like Levi’s, Nike, and Lee.   The ones I have the best luck with are the Elle brand (like Elle Magazine). And the Apartment 9 brand - which is like Target’s Merona and the Hudson stores INC.	episode_done:True

I have a pair of soft purple shorts and two perfectly shade/texture matching crop tops that have survived a considerable 3 years or so now, all of it definitely cost me less than $20 before my employee discount, I think it ended up being like $11 once all was said and done.

text:Southern hemisphere ladies where do you get inspo from?	labels:I had the same dilemma when I moved down under 2 years ago! To be honest, I just started following popular brands on Instagram - Zimmermann, Bec & Bridge, Camilla & Marc, Dion Lee, etc. The algorithm took care of the rest, lol.

text:Southern hemisphere ladies where do you get inspo from?	labels:depends on what's your vibe. try to find local influencers, the brands they're wearing and what works for you  here in Brazil (where I live) younger/trendier influencers have a very particular style that I don't follow 100% but like to check them out once in a while to see if there's something that fits my style. i can PM you a few instagram profiles if you're interested

text:Shitpost Saturday: Signature Scent	labels:*eau de essential worker* Notes of pritt glue stick, snotty jumper sleeves and hand sanitiser. This robust fragrance oil will almost distract you from how many times you’ve had to remind your class not to touch each other. Best enjoyed with a large coffee mug filled with wine, while shouting ‘PLEASE PRESS THE MUTE BUTTON WHILE MISS LOLLYKPOPS IS TALKING’ at a particularly excited 8 year old during your meeting with the home learners.	episode_done:True
text:Shitpost Saturday: Signature Scent	labels:Eau de T. Reg.: An undertone of iron from the blood of my enemies. A piquant whiff of brimstone. A fizz of pink Champagne builds with body heat.

text:Shitpost Saturday: Signature Scent	labels:*Eau de cat lady*: A heady blend of warm fur, litter dust, canned meat, and just the faintest hit of ammonia.   This cozy fragrance will remind you of working from home, wearing the same sweat pants every day, exercising by cleaning up vomit puddles, and somehow not minding any of it. Embrace your inner and outer cat lady - you'll never leave the house again!  ETA: Oh shit, I didn't read the assignment. This is totally my real life, sorry.

I lifted my head from the mound of cushions and attempted to extract my body from the hole in the sofa. Did I want another cup of tea? How many cups of tea had I drank? Did it matter?

text:Cotton Candy Femme Fatale: A Cassie (Promising Young Woman) inspo album	labels:Ooooh this is me! Cotton candy maximalist Lisa Frank is how I would describe my style. I like anything pastel and cute. Someone else mentioned Lirika Matoshi and I love her stuff. Edit: is it necessary to incorporate hard edged details?

text:Cotton Candy Femme Fatale: A Cassie (Promising Young Woman) inspo album	labels:I love this! Personally, I love to dress *majority* of the time in what I would have to call, “neutral academia” which is edging closer to, “dark academia” but with softer neutrals and occasional splashes of pink. This tends to be seen as professional, so it’s my work go-to. The closest reference I have is from the Chinese drama Meteor Garden, the newer one (2018?), I was amazed to see the Hua Ze Lei and I dress almost identical. A lot of that style section of my wardrobe is from Abercrombie, Little Lace, Reformation, and Nordstrom.   On the days I’m feeling playful, I dress more, “girly grunge” where I mix distressed jeans, with baby tees or crop tops and layer on a sweater or open cardigan. That section of my wardrobe is typically from Tilly’s, WildFox, Free People, Patagonia, or PacSun.   The days I feel moody/sexy remind me of the edgy part of your posts. I don’t wear black often so when I do I’m sultry about it. I love wearing Doc Martens or Paladins with distressed black skinny jeans and mesh tops, or a edgy graphic tee/sweater, or I wear fitted black dresses with any combination of shoes. I’m also really into wearing lingerie bodysuits with outfits—it’s feminine in the bedroom but reads as edgy once you step outside your house. That section of my wardrobe is typically from Ruckus, Dolls Kill, Gooseberry, Intimissimi, or Nasty Gal.   I incorporate hard details with accessories. A soft outfit can be topped off with a dark brown or black wool hat. I’m always wearing my All Saints goat head necklace, shortened to be almost a choker, and when I eventually replace that I’ll be looking on Etsy for a new one. It’s so dainty that it looks sweet until you *really* look. I also tend to carry a black purse no matter what the outfit. Plaid, gingham, and houndstooth also feel (to me) to work well together when making an edgy/soft combination look.   Such a great post, and good luck cultivating your dream wardrobe; you’re going to look amazing!	episode_done:True
text:Cotton Candy Femme Fatale: A Cassie (Promising Young Woman) inspo album	labels:Great album! I like to dress as girly or non-girly as I want, but always have dark nail polish to show that I'm edgy on the inside.	episode_done:True
text:Cotton Candy Femme Fatale: A Cassie (Promising Young Woman) inspo album	labels:I love this style!! I don’t wear it a ton bc, well, I haven’t been able to go anywhere. I have a sort of style I’ve dubbed “glitterbitch.” Basically it’s throwing on whatever you want and topping it with sparkly eyeshadow. This is along the lines of what I like, I love the sweater in the thumbnail and stuff from Lirika Matoshi or Selkie, both sadly too expensive for me but still my inspiration. I think adding neutrals or structured pieces can offset the soft nature and age it up a little.	episode_done:True
text:Cotton Candy Femme Fatale: A Cassie (Promising Young Woman) inspo album	labels:Oh my god that straw hat/doily dress?? Perfection!!!   I love wearing a 'cute' look at the grand old age of 37, but I try and make sure all the cute bits are always neat, tidy and made of quality materials to avoid looking too 'kiddy'. Quality fabrics and well-made vintage always elevate a look, I think!	episode_done:True
text:Cotton Candy Femme Fatale: A Cassie (Promising Young Woman) inspo album	labels:You might want to look into Japanese fashion magazines for inspiration. Dressing in sweet saccharine hues, ruffles, bows, polkadots, and just general cutesy-ness is a big thing. Refer to the magazines Ranzuki, Popteen, CanCam and AneCam, and Farfa if you're on the plus size side. Good luck!	episode_done:True

text:Cotton Candy Femme Fatale: A Cassie (Promising Young Woman) inspo album	labels:I LOVE this album. As for walking the line between cute and sensible, I really think there is no wrong way to do anything with style as long as it is 1. appropriate (fits the environment and situation you're in), 2. fits properly (including not too short, not ill-fitting, etc.) and most of all 3. makes you feel like you are stylish and makes you feel amazing. The album you have created really incorporates hard edged details into a softer look well. Notice how it's just 1-2 items, mostly accessories. That's the way to do.
text:You're absolutely right, as long as one isn't inappropriate, personal flair is a-ok. I actually often think to myself that when i'm elderly, I may actually like to wear say a cardigan with heart patterns or stars, but it will be in a relaxed fit and in a boyish 1920s silhouette.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Cotton Candy Femme Fatale: A Cassie (Promising Young Woman) inspo album	labels:First and foremost, this album is AMAZING!!! I fucking love the pieces, and you definitely channeled the essence Cassie so well with every outfit.   Truthfully I think there doesn't have to be a line between cute and sensible. I just make sure that I cater "cute" to my setting- like what's "cute" at the club, isn't going to be "cute" at work and vice versa. In terms of sensibility, fuck it. As long as your outfit is appropriate for your setting, and the heels aren't hurting your feet too much,  don’t worry about sensibility.   I typically like to interpret edginess into softer looks with significant color contrast, thoughtful accessories, and statement pieces. Like for instance, a soft colored dress with dark colored, edgy shoes and a bag to match the shoes. But statement pieces and accessories are the easiest way to give a cutesy, girly soft look some edge.

text:Experience with fast fashion brands for office casual clothes (Shein, Fashion Nova, etc)?	labels:I haven't yet shopped FashionNova/Shein. But have spent plenty of time shopping cheaper brands like Target, Old Navy, NY and Co, Kohls, H&M, Forever21. And honestly I have plenty of things from these places that have held up fine. Especially when you follow wash instructions and avoid the dryer as much as possible.   Even cheaper stores have some gems among the low quality items.  The biggest issue I found is that certain things needed to be replaced like annually or sometimes 2x a year. But on the other hand some stuff will just last forever. I had (have) some decade+ stuff from all of those places that still get worn.  Some were super frequent, some weren't.  Now that I am a bit older - I realize there are a few things I always wear - vetted by years of experience - that is makes sense to spend more on. I'll always use a black cardigan, grey cardigan, and black knit pencil skirt (ponte or similar) year over year - so those can be upgrade picks. But as for dresses? My vibe changes often so I am ok at saving on those and trading them out as I see fit. There are some that live in my closet forever, but really as long as I have a couple of black/white print dress options I am happy!	episode_done:True
text:Experience with fast fashion brands for office casual clothes (Shein, Fashion Nova, etc)?	labels:I would not recommend Shein.

text:Experience with fast fashion brands for office casual clothes (Shein, Fashion Nova, etc)?	labels:My 20s were spent wearing fast fashion as business casual! The really cheap brands (e.g. F21, Fashion Nova - this was before SheIn) did NOT work well for me - the low-quality was obvious in the fit and drape of the fabric, plus it was pretty difficult to find office-friendly pieces in the first place.  H&M and the Banana Republic/J Crew Factory Outlets (they're online!) were a lifeline, and I still wear many items!

text:Experience with fast fashion brands for office casual clothes (Shein, Fashion Nova, etc)?	labels:Full disclosure: I am not addressing any ethics concerns in my comment.   I've ordered a few times from Shein. I've gotten some really nice unique and flattering things that I get a lot of compliments on. I've only returned things that I didn't like on myself, not because they weren't as pictured. I find the exact measurements of every size and picture reviews very helpful. Don't order anything without reviews, at a minimum text reviews, and triple check the measurements and material on each item. I found the shipping to be decently quick and my refunds were processed quickly. No complaints.
text:Same I've had really good luck with some shein pieces but I also will only grab what has good reviews and photos.	labels:Same here. You can tell from customer photos which things have suitable cuts for the office (e.g. houndstooth/tweed stuff can be great but can be bodycon and the model photos don't always emphasise this), and which ones look to be good quality.	episode_done:True
text:Experience with fast fashion brands for office casual clothes (Shein, Fashion Nova, etc)?	labels:I think you would be best off buying from reputable brands during their sales. Their returns process will be better typically too. A $20 blouse on sale from J Crew Outlet is usually going to be better than a $20 blouse from Fashion Nova. A lot of these sites have customer service issues as well.  I have purchased from ROMWE (basically SHEIN they are the same company) and depending on the material you may be able to score some things decent enough for Zoom meetings, but not good enough that you will want to wear outside of a webcam.	episode_done:True

Usually I would mix them with more modern pieces or mix decades (so an Edwardian blouse with a 1940s skirt, for example) so it doesn't look like a costume. Most of my stuff I got from vintage/secondhand stores.	episode_done:True
text:Dressing 'out of time' (vintage/history bounding)	labels:I regularly look like a time traveling medieval witch. My wardrobe includes modernized kirtles, stays and petticoats. So yeah.  I got started long long ago when I was a historical costumer who decided that I really liked the way my medieval gear looked for everyday wear. Plus it's pretty practical for a cold winter. I make most of my historybounding gear still though I'll pick up anything that I find randomly that I think I can reuse.   People around me rarely react to my outfits. Occasionally I'll get compliments on them but I can full on wear a late Victorian walking skirt in public and nobody notices that it's a Victorian walking skirt. They do notice the pretty embroidery and I get comments on that. This trick relies on having a fairly modern silhouette for most of my stuff though. No obvious bustles and corsets. Mix in the occasional modern style clothing and it just sort of blends into people thinking I have a quirky fashion sense.  I have never felt a desire to hand sew underwear for a guinea pig. I'm honestly not the biggest Bernadette Banner fan girl. She's cool enough but she rarely goes into enough detail for me to replicate her techniques. There are other youtubers I like better for showing off how to do stuff in more detail.   I currently working on a piece that's inspired by Victorian depictions of medieval witches that's almost finished though. Next up is going to be a dress that's kinda sorta based on a Roman stola but with elastic cord involved.	episode_done:True
text:Dressing 'out of time' (vintage/history bounding)	labels:Well, I’m no fashion expert, but I’d try...  - mixing and matching old-timey-style things with modern things (like a corset over a tee (or blouse, for more vintage points) and modern pants/jeans, an old flowey dress with a modern leather jacket, things like that) - maybe adding vintage accessories (an antique locket, vintage hair pins?) - styling your hair in more vintage styles (like Bernadette)  Hope this is a good starter! If I think of any more I’ll try to update.
text:That’s really great advice. To start, slowly add pieces to your wardrobe that you can pair with what you already have. You’ll be more comfortable and get the chance to figure out what works.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Dressing 'out of time' (vintage/history bounding)	labels:I do this and nobody notices they aren't modern pieces, some are on trend. Victorian corset covers as camisoles underneath 90s flannel shirts, Edwardian mourning blouses paired with jeans and pistol boots, etc. Pretty much looks like modern day Sezane.	episode_done:True
text:Dressing 'out of time' (vintage/history bounding)	labels:When I was in university I was super into the 1950s look. My wardrobe had been a mix of vintage finds from specialized shops, eBay & Etsy, items from vintage reproduction stores, and things from regular stores (H&M, Zara) that had a vintage flair. I never went 100% as it felt too much like a costume to me, but wore a lot of day dresses, circle skirts, button up short sleeve blouses, etc. Paired with more modern items like ballerina flats or high waisted skinny jeans. I also frequently wore red lipstick and either slept with rollers or used hot rollers in the morning to get retro curls.  This was 2012-2014 in western Canada and the reaction was pretty mixed - some students made fun of me and I got a bit of a reputation on campus for being a weirdo, and I got a lot of stares when out in public. That said, I also got some really positive reactions (mostly from women). I eventually moved on from this look but still LOVE vintage items. I have a lot of vintage lingerie and a still have a few of my vintage dresses, tops, and pieces of jewelry. I also recently bought this gorgeous linen blouse from the 1800s at a flea market in Paris that gives me Shakespeare vibes - I like to wear it with distressed jeans and ballet flats. I want to try to find more pieces like that as I think paired with the right items it can look quite modern.	episode_done:True
text:Dressing 'out of time' (vintage/history bounding)	labels:I feel this! I’ve grown up obsessed with stories like little women, Anne of green gables, and a little princess, so I’ve always had an affinity for feminine, old fashioned styles. They are so wholesome and pretty 🤩 I’m a little afraid to dress that way in public since it’s not the norm, but I have some flowy night gowns with lace and ribbons and such, and I wear them to bed. I also have bloomer shorts with lace that were custom made for me. They’re so pretty. I’ve been buying more flowy dresses with little floral detailing lately. I don’t have a lot of money to spend, so I mostly buy from online stores, but you can get lucky finds at thrift stores, some unique pieces from Etsy, or from a specialty shop that specifically sells vintage clothing. A lot of those types of stores are located in downtown stores, so I’d look there!	episode_done:True

text:Office Clothes	labels:I am in a male-dominated field but in a sector of creatives in a professional office.  I usually wear:  -	Solid or patterned (houndstooth or understated plaid) pants. -	tops with interest like puff sleeves, boat necks, crochet detail, etc.  I don’t really like patterned tops. -	Tea length feminine dresses.  Not sheath style.  Usually a-line.  Most of my dress are in a mellow print.  -	cardigans or blazers depending on my mood  My personal palette is navy, forest green/dusty green, dark red spectrum, ivory, mustard, and sometimes black.  I can’t do pastels except pink because it washes me out, but they looks lovely on others.  I’d say 75% of my clothes come from Boden and the rest from Gap, Banana Republic, J. Crew, and some from Old Navy. Boden is my fav and their clothes feel and look nice in me and have lasted a while.   I get my pants mainly from any of those places that aren’t Boden.  Everything else, dresses and tops are from there for the most part.	episode_done:True

text:I am with you Pawbean. I am all about comfort At the office and cheap buys or things that I know will last. Banana republic had a version of the Sloan pant that they marketed at “travel” pants because they were breathable and stretchy. Loved them. This is a trick I “learned” in Boston, our building was in front of cobblestone/brick and my shoes would get ruined in no time. So I wore sneakers in and kept nice shoes in a locked drawer. Lulus and Walmart make great Sam Edelman knock off flats for half the price.  Also... to lululemon: please take your logo off the leg of dress pants.

text:Buying vs selling on resell websites	labels:I bought/sold on Poshmark when it was starting to get popular, and found great deals and sold pretty easily on it. I stopped a year later - by that time, I had started seeing wholesale distributers flooding the site and making it alot harder for me to find actual used clothing for decent prices. I'd agree that there are likely too many sellers now compared to buyers - or at least too much merchandise compared to buyers. To me, that makes Poshmark too much like Ebay, and is no longer as distinct a platform as it used to be.  Edit: typos
text:I mean tbh I have a harder time with random people wondering why something they bought at target two years ago isn't worth retail price or above now and arguing that its out of production so it's worth more (girl it's our of production because they don't keep producing the same things season to season oh my God).   I think some of this comes down to the encouragement of bargaining on the platform. People will say they anticipate being offered a lower number so they'll overprice something, but if you're a buyer that's just an additional layer of hassle that would stop impulsive purchases which isn't great for getting things sold.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:There's far too much merchandise, too much of the same stuff, too much complete junk to sort through, and a lot of sellers who have no idea how to sell their items. The categories and filters aren't that well thought-out, so you need to have a pretty specific idea of what keywords to search (or the patience to go through multiple categories). They could seriously improve the site for sellers and buyers by reorganizing their categories, adding boxes for measurements (and a checkbox for "listing contains measurements"), and removing items that don't sell after 6 months (the seller could always relist, but there are hundreds (probably thousands) of items that haven't even been updated in a year and sellers who seem to have abandoned their accounts).  As far as I know, you can't even set alerts for certain keywords or filters, which makes it even harder to use than Ebay--that said, when I do secondhand shop/browse I prefer Poshmark because it's easier to see at a glance whether the information is all there, which is a key aspect in whether I even consider buying an item.	labels:Yes absolutely with the old listings and abandoned accounts. I feel like everyone and their mother is jumping aboard the selling train right now, but the wholesalers grind my gears. No escaping them in this day and age, but eBay is worse than Poshmark because it’s nothing but Chinese scammers and drop shippers from Ali express and Taobao. Same for Etsy. Poshmark seems to have less of that (for now) at least in the categories I browse. But I agree there’s way too much crap on there. You can pretty much only sell if it’s a higher end brand name piece of clothing and not just general clothes because there are so many accounts with literally 1000 pieces of fast fashion garbage eternally listed   I’ll also add the constant invitation to go to peoples dumb selling parties and people constantly sharing my items is weird as a casual seller. I get that they’re trying to make it like a social media thing but it’s pretty transparent people are sharing my stuff so I’ll share theirs but I don’t have time for that and it clogs up my notifications so I’ve missed people bundling my stuff  Edited because i fumbled trying to correct it and hit send too soon!
text:> Same for Etsy.  This kills me on etsy. Look at this 'homemade' antique style ceramic cup set! $45 for a set of 2. And then you buy it and it says ikea on the bottom.  Or a 'handmade' beanie for $30 and its still got the made in korea tag and you see it on amazon for $4 dollars+free shipping.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:I agree. I like buying secondhand mostly so I used to use Posh/etc a tooooon and have pretty much stopped. I actually find better deals on eBay now for the same things. Sellers want to charge full retail (or more) for items and act like negotiating is a personal attack when that's literally what the site was designed for. Couple that with expensive shipping, no returns, and the high occurrence of issues with orders it just isn't worth it. The last time I was on this site was the summer and everything that I made reasonable offers is still sitting, now cheaper than what I originally offered, and because the sellers gave me attitude they lost my sale. I don't see Posh being successful for much longer, honestly. Mercari is just as bad and harder to find things on.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Buying vs selling on resell websites	labels:I buy/sell on eBay, Poshmark, depop, and Mercari. There are pros and cons to all of them. For me I’m not trying to make money or save money necessarily—I just want to recycle clothes that didn’t work for me and from everything I’ve read most donated clothes end up in landfills. I also prefer to buy secondhand for similar reasons.   Poshmark definitely has the best customer service. I’ve dealt with a lot of bad sellers (listing the wrong size, clothes not as described etc) and whenever I’ve reached out to Poshmark they basically refund all my money and let me keep the item. On the flip side, as a seller people have unnecessarily complained (item didn’t fit) and Poshmark didn’t allow them to send the item back for a refund—maybe Poshmark gave them a refund and let them keep the item but I wasn’t effected. This is something that REALLY irritates me about eBay—they always take the side of the buyer and u end up having wasted time, money etc shipping something even when u aren’t at fault. I really wish eBay would absorb the costs like Poshmark does, but this is probably why Poshmark has the highest fees.  Ultimately I think the downfall of Poshmark will be the wholesalers and people who are doing it as a side hustle. It’s becoming harder and harder for sellers with 20-30 listings from their actual personal closet to sell things because there’s so much garbage for buyers to sift through. It’s also hard for me as a buyer to find bundles anymore. In the early days sellers closets were made up of actual clothes from their closets so they were all the same size and the style of the person selling. Now if I find something I like it’s impossible to find another item in someone’s closet because there are 500 random listings to sift through.

text:What are the Luxury IT Bags right now? And which ones are actually worth the $?	labels:The #1 It bag right now is the Prada Re-Edition. Because of that, you will be seeing a lot of nylon and half-moon shaped shoulder bags over the next few months. Bag trends go in and out pretty quickly, so it is much more important to pick one that you really love (especially when you are dropping that kind of money!). The Dior Saddle Bag is an older bag style that they brought back in and saw a huge resurgence in popularity. It's not as trendy as it was when they reintroduced it, but it looks pretty likely to stick around as a staple style for the brand. Dior has been getting more expensive recently. The price doesn't really reflect the quality (the quality is just as nice as many luxury brands with lower price points), so you are really paying for the brand.
text:Yeah you’re right the Prada is everywhere but I’m really not a fan of it! It’s just so small. I think you’re right about the saddle bag too, not worth the cost especially for such an impractical shape! But it does look awesome with the various Dior straps	labels:Dior definitely knows what they are doing with the guitar straps! Which is why they charge $1k+ just for the strap on top of a $3.3k+ bag! If you want your bag to be relatively timeless, you can invest in something like a Lady Dior or Chanel Classic Flap, or opt for a more simple style bag from most any of the major brands. But if your style is more edgy and youthful like the Saddle Bag love suggests, you might just want to get what makes you feel happiest and what is most practical for your lifestyle and budget, regardless of what people are wearing at this exact moment in fashion.

Anyway we searched high and low right up until the week of prom, we drove to the US from Canada and looked there and I still couldn’t find a pair of heels that fit enough to buy and I decided I’d just wear uncomfy like always and deal with it.   Then I randomly walked into a thrift store and saw on the shoe rack a pair of pink heels in the exact shade of pink on my dress, with black trim. Picked them up, size 12W. They fit like they were made for me.   Wore them until they broke three years ago.

text:I had picked out black heels to buy for my uni graduation, was thinking to buy them next month. I was randomly walking into a second hand store to spend some time before bus. And there they were, my heels, my size, brand new and 90% cheaper then in store. Yes it's like common brand here, but brand new shoes  in thrift store for that price is definetly not normal.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:I can somewhat relate. My mom wears an 11W. I grew up watching her struggle endlessly to find shoes. She’s also an avid thrifter. For some reason I’ve long been better than her at spotting the one random pair of 11Ws in sight, whether thrift shop or regular store. Even since I moved out I find things for her regularly and mail them. (And send the bill.) I’ll usually text her, but I know her style well enough that I’m comfortable buying stuff without her approval. I know I’ve found several pairs she wears almost daily.	labels:Aww, you're a good daughter!	episode_done:True

I also go the opposite, slim fitted trousers and ponte pants with more whimsical tops. I'm not really pushing an boundaries because the industry I work in is pretty relaxed even for execs, but I definitely look a little different from most others in my office. I feel like I'm giving a nod to my love of hippie shit and my half Indian background at the same time, while looking professional and pretty polished

text:Shopping for clothing items you already own: confessions of an outfit repeater	labels:Little black dresses for me. Sometimes I look at my closet and think, "I should really get more color in there," but the fact is, I feel happiest and most myself in neutrals. Past couple years I've been trying more colorful clothes. They do get compliments and objectively I like them, but what are my workhorses? The neutrals. Mainly knee-length black dresses. And a single red bodycon dress that's made its way into the regular rotation.  So now I'm trying to look for clothing with interesting texture, silhouettes, and architectural details, but color is no longer a requirement. I make up for it by having a colorful home.	episode_done:True
text:Shopping for clothing items you already own: confessions of an outfit repeater	labels:I'm quite picky about tops so if I find a style I like in a good, durable fabric that won't disintegrate after 3 washes, I like to buy it in different colors so I have some variety in my outfits (even if it's just the same silhouettes all the time lol).

text:Shopping for clothing items you already own: confessions of an outfit repeater	labels:I’ve recently stopped doing this, actually! I was a sweater collector for years. Boxy crewnecks in super thick woven materials and weird patterns. I had like 50 for awhile, it was straight up out of hand. I’ve finally stopped buying them and managed to part with most and actually wear through a few (and unfortunately stained several and never wore again, which happens to anything light colored that I own). Now I’ve got a handful of good sweaters with enough room for another if I find one I *really* need.              All that said though, I’ve gotten into my mid twenties and my body has changed so now I can barely even wear sweaters at all anymore because I’m too damn hot all the time. Has anybody else had this change too? I used to be cold all the time and now I’m roasting in a t shirt at 70 degrees.	episode_done:True

We're under strict lockdown again in my area, so I'm sure there will be even more stores gone once malls open again. I really do miss physical stores - my sizing is weird, so it really helped to be able to try things on without going through a cumbersome returns process.	episode_done:True
text:Store closings at malls	labels:There’s been closings of things due to the pandemic but like Sears & JCPenney’s. Also on the food side there’s been restaurant closures.  As far as returns go, the place might be lenient with you on the return window and accept a return, worth a shot if you do find yourself going back to those malls.
text:I'd expect closings from Sears and JC Penny's...  I'm wondering how bad the carnage will be when this is over. I have not gone in person, just googled and found out they are closed.  Early in the pandemic, they were lenient. I wanted to return an item and at the time, the store was still in the mall but they were not open so I couldn't return. I returned by mail and they refunded me the shipping costs.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Store closings at malls	labels:I pretty infrequently went to the mall, but stores closing retail locations really doesn't impact their online store much. It can, if the stores are fulfilling the orders, but most major brands should be adapted to online long before today and are able to fulfill orders. It impacts the business in that they're not getting the retail location revenue but they're already established online with processes and can usually just adapt. Unfortunately, brands with retail locations can't be like Amazon because Amazon's business is really hosting the retail of other brands with some of its own products, which means it has more resources and volume to make various returns, deliveries, etc. more efficient. It's not without its issues itself. Unfortunately, it's a hard time for retailers. :(	episode_done:True

The first version was giving one of the people in our office headaches, so she changed up the components and that solved that problem. For me, most perfumes trigger headaches at best, and migraines at worst, so I avoid people who wear perfume. It seems like perfume has become less prevalent in recent years, and as far as I'm concerned I'm thrilled about that since it's difficult to avoid scents as a health trigger.	episode_done:True

I wear mainly Hermes perfumes only (because they don’t give me a migraine like a lot of other perfumes do), and I rotate between them based on how I feel and would like to be perceived if someone catches a whiff of my perfume as I walk by. I also have been in a situation where someone I’m talking to seems genuinely nice, etc but has horrendous perfume on. I can’t focus on anything else but the bad scent when this happens.	episode_done:True

I would probably judge more on whether it is too overpowering.   I've always worn one that I think is nice, but I now wonder if it's too smoky when my clothing choices aren't overly feminine, so I'm wondering if I should mix it up with something more floral.

What are some of your favourites?	labels:As much as I want to try many scents, I've worn Glossier You since 2018 and people associate it with me / recognize me by it now, so it's my "signature scent." I love how it smells anyway so I'm sticking with it. It's pretty affordable compared to a lot of fragrances I've seen and having just one appeals to my minimalist sensibilities.  In middle school my fav was Avril Lavigne Black Star. 😂	episode_done:True

Men who smell good always get my attention, but too much chokes me out. There are some vanillas I just can’t handle. But I always choose depending on what I am wearing.	episode_done:True

text:Best way to buy clothes locally?	labels:I shop at locally owned businesses, I go to thrift stores, and I follow local artisans to shop for their products.   &#x200B;  I'm a bit confused as to why it is hard for you to find anything unless you live in a town that only has chain stores

text:Best way to buy clothes locally?	labels:I am lucky to live in a large city, pre-COVID there were lots of artisan/craft market days where you could find clothes and jewelry that were locally made.

text:Best way to buy clothes locally?	labels:There are websites that feature many different “local” boutiques that you can shop at with one click, so to speak. I use Trouva and Avocadostore to buy from different sustainable boutiques across Europe for clothes and home wear. I can even narrow my search to just my particular city. Even though I use one online site, I have to pay shipping if shopping from different stores. There is an incentive to shop at one place though, like they give a discount on shipping or something.   I know some local boutiques use farfetch as well.	episode_done:True
text:Best way to buy clothes locally?	labels:In the Before Times, my family made a habit of attending the local fairs and farmers markets, which was a great way to find local jewelry and something I really miss.  Summer before last, I got weirdly obsessed with googling and visiting *every* thrift/consignment shop when I was out and taking notes, so at this point I'm intimately familiar with what kind of stuff all within about a 60 mile radius tend to get, which has been a godsend in looking for things nowadays.  It's also worth hitting up wherever Main Street/the old part of your city is.  It can be pricey sometimes, but it's a good method of finding local sellers.	episode_done:True

I’ve made good friends with the owner of my local one after visiting quite regularly over the past few years (COVID permitting of course). My most recent purchase was a grey wool blazer from Jigsaw. It was bnwt and only £35, but would have been well over £100 originally. Some are selling online now too so that might be worth checking out seeing as we can’t get the thrill of the charity shop hunt in person at the moment. Happy bargain hunting!

text:Matching shoes & purse	labels:I don’t think fashion has any rules anymore unless you’re royalty or it’s cultural.   I personally don’t like matchy matchy bag and shoes unless I’m going for a monochrome look. I tend to match tones rather than colours. I like a patterned bag (say Gucci dionysus or Fendi zucca or LV canvas) as opposed to patterned clothes because I find they blend in well with a variety of outfit choices.   If I do colour, I will make sure the tone matches. I can’t stand mixing warm times with cool tones. Eg I have a cool tone lilac paid of heels that I love wearing with my cool tone magenta bag.   You can also do opposite sides of the colour wheel with shoes and bags like a green bag and a purple/magenta pair of shoes. But again keep to the same tones. The key with fashion is the tone of colours, and that includes neutral colours too. I would always suggest everyone does a colour/tone analysis and then stick to buying items in that range. It makes mixing and matching easier.

text:I do the exact same thing with warm tones! Most colors have variations that fall in either side, like mint green and dusty teal read warmer than spring green. Even navy can go cooler or warmer. Black and white are pretty neutral, anything else has to be warm toned to work for me. If everything is the same tone, it's way easier to mix and match!	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Is Chanel going to be better off without Karl?	labels:I feel like Karl Lagerfeld's legacy & tenure really glossed over his last decade or so of design. Sure there were some good shows in the 2010s, but a lot of it was just....   Virginie Viard is always going to come up short because she's Lagerfeld-esque and has the misfortune of coming directly after Lagerfeld. Lagerfeld was good at making his name and Chanel synonymous so that if you see a tweed jacket - you immediately think of both. As Viard tries to draw upon Chanel classics & house standards, it's seen as copying Lagerfeld (and failing) rather than her being referential. She hasn't really presented her point of view, separate from Chanel or Lagerfeld, either, so it's really hard to pick up on the specific aspects of her designs that are *hers.*

text:Is Chanel going to be better off without Karl?	labels:Karl was a great creative and brought a lot of creativity to the brand, but it was A LOT different than Coco Chanel's classic, timeless, etc. His creativity helped elevate the brand with younger and trend-centric customers, which was good, without necessarily alienating the legacy customers who are not aspirational consumers buying the lower priced items but truly wealthy customers buying the $$$ items. It is a feat in itself to meet both, but that's also from excellent marketing and business team (not just him). The brand may be trying to cater more to its true wealth vs aspirational customers at the moment to keep the brand afloat during this time since the supply chain and margins are likely different, and the aspirational consumers are not able to buy as much due to impact on income, etc. But, fashion brands also play to the mood of the market, what more fashion-focused less trend-focused consumers are heading, etc. and it's global so it is much broader than just one country, etc. The new collection is still very fashion forward and very pretty. But, not as rocker/edge/creative as Karl's days. The thing with Chanel is that it has the younger aspirational consumer so hooked on its lower priced items, it really doesn't need to innovate for it - they consider the earrings, lower priced handbags, wallets, etc. to be status no matter what it is because they're buying the brand. Where, overall, it likely all works out. It's nice to see the change of vibe, but I did enjoy Karl's. His vibe was also getting a little tired, he was there forever. But, they are wise not to try to replicate him.
text:Of course people like Chanel because of the status quo the brand gives off but Karl impacted it to greater heights which we have seen today. It was a dead brand before Karl joined.	labels:The brand was huge before Karl, Coco was alive until 1971, and it was a major luxury brand at that time, before and after. He joined in 1983. But he did a great job at getting the mainstream aspirational consumer and young wealthy into the brand, which is what it needed. I know women who are in their 60s and 70s who have Chanel from way back when. There was a time after WW2 that the brand struggled a little, but so did nearly all luxury European brands at the time. Overall though it's always been a key brand in the category.
text:It was huge but it was struggling real hard to the point the owners wanted to just keep it as a perfume company. 11 designers after Coco's death. The Wertheimer brothers approached Karl and he is the one who changed the classic flap for the better and like you said made Chanel grand and even a larger status people aspire to be apart of.	labels:Agreed! I studied Chanel for a project, I love that we have both geeked out on Coco!

They have now become my house project jeans. And every time I put them on I actually sigh they are so comfortable! Just enough give to just move with me. So long story short I have them on poshmark notifications, every time I go into a thrift store I look for them in my size. They aren’t super hard to find but I’m a 0 long and that’s not a size I see often. It’s to the point I know what they feel like compared to other jeans and can spot them really fast. THREE DAYS AGO I FOUND THEM IN MY SIZE AGAIN. I practically ran to the check out. When I pulled them out of the dryer and put them on I actually danced. They are so perfect!

Typical etiquette for hat wearing is that if it's a very small decorative hat--something that stays close to the head--you may wear it indoors, but if it's a larger hat, you take it off indoors.  With something like a cloche or beret, which isn't exactly tiny but also isn't oppressively huge, it follows nearly the same rules as a coat:  If you're just popping by on an errand, it's fine to keep it on, but if you're planning to stay a while, you should take it off.  This is especially true if you're visiting a place of hospitality--a friend or relative's home, for example, or a restaurant--where somebody is offering comfort and relaxation, keeping your hat/coat on might be seen as a rejection of their hospitality.

text:Hats and how to wear them	labels:Everyone still wears hats! I keep the hat on at all times usually but it depends on the hat. For example, if I am going to be indoors for a duration of time (longer than average grocery trip) I will sometimes take a winter hat off because it'll get too warm to keep it on, or if it is out of place indoors for a long duration. Wear the cloche out! Hats are a great and super easy accessory to up level a look and make items into an outfit.	episode_done:True

I find that very feminine romantic looks really suit hats like this and I have similar large straw hats that kinda go with anything soft and flowy in warm weather.

What gives with your "friend"?  Now, if you find yourself unable to do that -- you're STILL okay. And if you need help, obviously that's why Daily Questions etc exist.

I've had *strangers* ask me if I was ok because they assumed someone who resembled a corpse that much must be actually nearing death.   I love heels and very sleek business casual as well as what I can only call ho-fits. I have bad ankles fr from working on concrete floors too many hours, and take public transportation. It's too much of a risk I could sprain my ankle from how much I walk, and I can't afford another sprain. My office is not business casual or sleek, but a no fuss "just don't wear t-shirts with slogans or anything" type of place. I am decidedly over my ho phase, despite my continued love of the clothes.   My fantasy of wearing heeled booties with a structured fashion blazer over a mauve dress is not any less real just because I have the common sense to not go through with it.

text:Style rut: Pinterest vs reality	labels:I think 'fashionable' and skinny/ white/ young etc. get confused a lot. A young, thin, white conventionally attractive woman wears and oversized tee and some leggings and its a 'look', and if I do that I've given up on myself.   I also think the overall styling of a look plays into whether its fashionable or not. A lot of the people you see on pinterest/ insta are wearing tailored clothes or have the photos edited or the clothes pinned at the back to make it look perfect. Hair and make up are also a part of how 'done up' you look.   Also, its not okay for people to be making comments that are hurtful even if they're not intending to hurt you. Its okay to say you're not okay with that.

text:Style rut: Pinterest vs reality	labels:my fashion professor was a very plain dresser. she had a passion for history and couture but she didn’t dress like it. and that was cool because later i was working somewhere where i literally wore a rubber fishing jacket most days and i always looked dirty or wet. since then, i have made a pinterest board of what i own and then a board within that of things i want to own. it’s cool because once you find your item, clicking on the pin will show you a bunch of similar items and outfits. so that’s where i was before the pandemic and hopefully where i can start from after.	episode_done:True

If, for example, you’re constantly seeing neutral colored cardigans or black boots, those are items you can actually go and buy.	episode_done:True

text:What does business casual mean to you?	labels:It's really dependant upon where you are. In South Florida, business casual is golf slacks and a polo, or a wrap dress with sandals (and this isn't the entirety of business casual in South Florida, I'm just pointing out things that would not generally be seen as such elsewhere.)   The best bet is to go online, find this group's Facebook or Instagram accounts and look at what people are wearing at their events. I doubt very much that anyone is going to bat an eyelash at you wearing a skirt, and I'm sure that your work clothing is absolutely appropriate for whatever events you're attending.

text:What does business casual mean to you?	labels:I usually do a nice blouse + skirt or a sheath dress for business casual. But I work in finance so my business casual may be different.

text:What does business casual mean to you?	labels:My usual office wear is midi circle skirt and blouse, sheer black tights, pointy flat shoes, cardigan or blazer.  Or a midi or knee length dress, cardigan or blazer.  In some offices I've worked in, solid coloured jeans with no rips count as business casual.  I would wear them with solid coloured tshirts or knitwear and boots or shoes but not sports shoes.	episode_done:True
text:What does business casual mean to you?	labels:To me it's more about the materials and cuts than it is about the pieces, because fabric and cut define the range of casual, to business casual, to professional, to formal, etc. The same type of item can look any of these all depending on the fabric and cut. That's how I view it.	episode_done:True
text:What does business casual mean to you?	labels:I go to a lot of networking events in the STEM field, where the dress code is business casual, and I know that business casual in STEM is a whole different beast to business casual Law, and as Australians in a hot city, I'm guessing it's a lot different to a colder climate city. Probably way more casual.  After work networking events: whatever I wear to work. Generally long sleeved button up, mini skirt or skinny jeans, ankle boots, loafers, oxfords or sneakers. No effort into hair or makeup.   Networking event where I know there'll be bigwigs: I'll swap out the mini skirt for a pencil skirt, or a sheath dress. Definitely avoiding sneakers.   For an event with kids (like industry engagement): I'll make an effort to present more femme and do nicer hair, makeup, work heels, pencil skirt, polo. Sometimes blazer. I am almost definitely overdressed, but I think it's important to subvert the stereotype of female engineers as "pink steel cap boots" because that's not really indicative of me.	episode_done:True
text:What does business casual mean to you?	labels:I think it's basically woven or high end knit items that are tailored and polished. So chinos, a button down, a merino sweater, skirts, dresses, etc.   I think jersey knits, tees, jeans, sneakers---those can squeak in on a casual day and if styled impeccably, but I lean towards woven in general.   Coverage wise, it's usually from the neck to the knees continuously or more (meaning no belly shirts, no cut outs, and if it's sleeveless, it's not a tank top or camisole alone).   Tightness wise I think it's "skimming" the body. It's not tight, snug, or showing off curves, but it's not baggy in a casual way. I do think biz caz can be oversized, but that's like...advanced biz caz, like a loose linen dress with a loose linen blazer and simple flats on a hot day type deal.   Generally patterns and prints are small and discreet, no slogans, and no "novelty" items or promotional wear.   No workout items, no sleepwear or lingerie.   In your case, I think the events are indicating "smart casual" meaning no open toes/flip flops, no jeans, shorts, tees, or other overly-casual items.	episode_done:True
text:What does business casual mean to you?	labels:If you are a woman, then skirts are absoluely part of business casual.  In fact, there are still some business formal environment that insist on women wearing skirts, even though such a rule is coming to be seen as a red flag for workplace misogyny.    Business casual can mean pretty much anything that is less formal than a complete suit in conservative cut and color, but more formal than jeans and a t-shirt.  In some industries, 'business casual' might still mean suit and tie, but your blazer and skirt/slacks don't have to match and maybe you can wear khaki instead of navy.    In other industries 'business' casual might mean "just about anything that isn't jeans, shorts, or a t-shirt."  I've seen solid-wash denim trousers, bold patterned dresses, baggy sweaters, even sheer, sleeveless tops being worn as 'business casual,' even though I'd describe that more as smart casual.   If it's at all possible, try to find someone who has been to one of these events who can tell you more specifically what 'business casual' means to this club.  If not, then I would suggest wearing a white, button-down cotton shirt with a collar and a full or 3/4 length sleeve, paired with a simple, knee-length skirt in black, navy or gray suiting, black nylons.  It's boring, but it's your safest bet for something that'll pass muster while you scope out the crowd and find out what your other options are.	episode_done:True

I have a Chloe Lexa that I got for 50% off when it got discontinued and it‘s a great bag. I‘d never buy either brand at full price though.  I‘m trying not to get sucked into any nee handbag trends, I really want to shop my own closet this year. That said, I got a piece from the Loewe x Totoro capsule collection that I couldn‘t be more excited to wear this spring!   If I really had to pick, I‘d say that I‘m still eyeing a Loewe puzzle or a celine belt bag. I do like the Dior Bobby and the newly released Caro as well.

text:Overdressing - Discussion	labels:Oh god. I'm instantly reminded of the embarrassment I felt whenever I showed up to a pregame for a frat formal and then realized it was SEMIFORMAL. I was there in a long red gown and everyone was in minidresses... I already felt out of place because I wasn't in a sorority, just was dating a guy in the frat. Thankfully I begged my bf at the time to bring me home before the formal and I changed to a better dress.  Anyway, I tend to be an overdresser. In college I felt more comfortable dressed how I wanted to rather than in big tshirts and athletic shorts or leggings. At the office, I work with a bunch of old dudes that are wearing polos at their dressiest lol. I'm perfectly fine being the odd one out there.  I think it's mostly rude to overdress whenever there's a stated dresscode. Like in my first example, I wouldn't call it "rude" but it definitely looked off.
text:This makes me feel 100% like I have the few times I’ve seriously overdressed. If you can’t feel confident and will think about it all night the look will not be the hit that you know it is in a situation you can feel confident.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Overdressing - Discussion	labels:I work on political campaigns for a living, and part of putting together event briefings for candidates is deciphering the dress code and putting in plain English what they should wear.  Neither of these were my candidates, but I have seen two candidates overdressed for the event-- one man and one woman (of opposing parties).  This particular event was a beach cleanup sponsored by an environmental group.  Volunteers were gathered to literally pick up trash from the beach.   If anything, the accessory of the day was cleaning gloves.  The male candidate wore a designer suit and newly shined dress shoes.  The female candidate wore a skirt suit (think Sarah Palin) with 4 inch stilettos.    This event was back in 2011.  When I put together what a candidate should wear to an event, I think of these two candidates dressed to the nines to pick up garbage from the beach.

I would have stood out a ton and potentially been messed with if I'd worn fancy dresses and things like that (for example while walking my dog).  It's much more comfortable and appropriate to dress up in my current neighborhood.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:My husband has a little outpatient procedure under light sedative at the hospital. I need to go with him because he’s going to be a bit zoinked out. Now, do I care about going to a place where Covid is rife and full of vulnerable people? Do I care that my husband’s about to undergo a not fun test? Yes, I do. But to my shame, after 5 weeks inside and 9 more predicted to come (UK) I am mostly thinking about  what I am going to wear. I AM GOING OUT! Fake fur, big red shoes, velvet, leopard and sequins are firm candidates. BUT I doubt I will follow through because I am afraid it will show a degree of carelessness and disrespect to hospital workers and patients. So it will be comfy and neutral, but it’s fine because I AM GOING OUT!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Overdressing - Discussion	labels:Oh god. I'm instantly reminded of the embarrassment I felt whenever I showed up to a pregame for a frat formal and then realized it was SEMIFORMAL. I was there in a long red gown and everyone was in minidresses... I already felt out of place because I wasn't in a sorority, just was dating a guy in the frat. Thankfully I begged my bf at the time to bring me home before the formal and I changed to a better dress.  Anyway, I tend to be an overdresser. In college I felt more comfortable dressed how I wanted to rather than in big tshirts and athletic shorts or leggings. At the office, I work with a bunch of old dudes that are wearing polos at their dressiest lol. I'm perfectly fine being the odd one out there.  I think it's mostly rude to overdress whenever there's a stated dresscode. Like in my first example, I wouldn't call it "rude" but it definitely looked off.
text:I have been frustrated attending events like that as a plus-one, because my BF doesn't really understand that specific levels of dress code actually mean different things. He just interprets them all as fancy. Not helpful. Please, let me read the invitation, email, facebook event, and/or wedding website myself, don't just tell me what day it is.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Overdressing - Discussion	labels:I work on political campaigns for a living, and part of putting together event briefings for candidates is deciphering the dress code and putting in plain English what they should wear.  Neither of these were my candidates, but I have seen two candidates overdressed for the event-- one man and one woman (of opposing parties).  This particular event was a beach cleanup sponsored by an environmental group.  Volunteers were gathered to literally pick up trash from the beach.   If anything, the accessory of the day was cleaning gloves.  The male candidate wore a designer suit and newly shined dress shoes.  The female candidate wore a skirt suit (think Sarah Palin) with 4 inch stilettos.    This event was back in 2011.  When I put together what a candidate should wear to an event, I think of these two candidates dressed to the nines to pick up garbage from the beach.   This is NOT an image you want to convey to voters.
text:I think this is an excellent example of when I think overdressing is rude.  How you dress communicates things. If you show up to a situation where messy and/or physical activities are planned and you're not dressed appropriately, you're essentially communicating distain for the planned activities. It's a non-verbal declaration of "you all go ahead and get dirty, I'll just watch."   If you're too good for picking up trash, why did you come to the trash cleanup day? If you knew you weren't going to participate in our frisbee game, why did you come to the frisbee party? Why did you come camping if you aren't prepared to let any part of you touch dirt - are you expecting everyone else to do extra work to make your camping experience squeaky clean? The only way to avoid that message is to dive right in and ruin your nice clothes.	labels:Aw this reminds me of the time when, in our honeymoon in France, we last-minute booked a grape-picking experience at a vineyard. I had no proper shoes so I just wore a pair of golden flats which were the most comfortable pair I had packed. When we went to the vineyard it was rainy and muddy and I felt quite judged by the looks when the rest of the people saw my shoes, they were all wearing rain boots or more appropriate gear. I was not expecting to go grape-picking in the mud when I packed! Anyway, the tour guide and the other women in the group made a bigger deal out of it than I did, I just went straight into the mud with my shiny shoes. It was incredibly fun and yes my shoes ended up all muddy but a good clean and they were good as new.
text:Haha oh no! That's exactly what I mean though, you weren't using your wardrobe as an excuse to stay aloof.... you can't prepare for every situation, especially when travelling.  I think the universe can sense when we're not prepared for rain. The only trip I've ever had to cut short due to weather was when it started pouring rain and no one in our camping group had brought rain gear... because we were visiting Death Valley, the driest place in North America!	labels:	episode_done:True

I'd also add that being overdressed (or underdressed) to an event with a dress code can also show disrespect for the host who chose the dress code.  For instance, being noticeably overdressed for a wedding could indicate that you think it's improper for someone to have a wedding that casual.

text:Spend $250 on a good replica bag or Tory Burch?	labels:I buy pre-owned past season bags exclusively. The discount is 80%-90% off the retail usually. So, I’d pick that option?

text:Spend $250 on a good replica bag or Tory Burch?	labels:I have a few designer bags, but I bought them heavily discounted. I went through a PHASE and bought a bunch of bags, and now I'm done. I also regret spending thousands on waxed canvas??  I have a friend who fucks with reps and she's always concerned that someone will call her out for owning fakes. I wouldn't be able to deal with that constant stress, even if the bag were a really good knock off and I got a great deal (compared to retail) on it. I also think that the whole "they aren't QCing the bag, they're QCing you" is really fucking rude.  If I buy more bags, I wouldn't buy designer and stick to okay quality and mid-tier prices. There's nothing wrong with indulging if it's going to bring you joy, but I think that a lot of people drop $$$$ on a bag and then never  fully enjoy it because they're afraid of scuffing the leather.
text:Waxed canvas, lol. Yup. I got tons of that.  Worrying about people being able to tell you have a fake and being self conscious about it is not worth it.	labels:The self-consciousness wasn't worth it to me, either. I decided I was better off going quality no-name, since the brands I could afford were not doing anything I liked. One day I'll have the money for even a used name that I'm interested in, but for now I'll support a smaller operation.	episode_done:True
text:Spend $250 on a good replica bag or Tory Burch?	labels:I’d probably go with a lesser known brand/designer or something on a great sale (yoox, outnet, etc) instead. Some of the bigger names (like Kors and Kate Spade) I find to be mediocre quality for the price.	episode_done:True
text:Spend $250 on a good replica bag or Tory Burch?	labels:I think it depends on the bag you want! If you really truly want a specific Dior bag for example but don’t want to spend $3k on it, you could probably spend about $300 on a nice rep. If you actually just want a specific shape/leather type, you can probably look at Coach and Tory Burch, or even smaller contemporary brands like Mansur Gavriel or Polene.  I’d recommend making a wishlist of bags and write out pros and cons of getting authentic pieces vs replicas, including price and how much you actually want it.  For a while I’ve been spending money on contemporary brands and a few auth designer bags, but recently I’ve been fulfilling my bag wishlist through reps and it feels liberating honestly. You can save money and still get the bag you truly want, and if there’s a bag you really like and you want to support the designer in some way besides wearing their logo/brand, you can always save up for and buy the auth.	episode_done:True
text:Spend $250 on a good replica bag or Tory Burch?	labels:I wouldn’t spend money on a replica no matter how high quality it is. I wouldn’t feel right ripping off the intellectual property of the original designer.
text:I like your integrity but i think of how crazy it is that most fashionable ideas are copies of other fashionable ideas. I have seen a few Kate spade bags that are pretty direct copies of YSL’s Sac Du Jour, Rebecca Minkoff and Michael Kors are pretty notorious for being inspired by whatever the it bag of the moment is. high fashion dictates and then that idea is typically diluted to the masses so intellectual property becomes an interesting conundrum. 99% invisible has a great episode about counterfeits if you are interested!	labels:>nspired by whatever the it bag of the moment is. high fashion dictates and then that idea is typically diluted to the masses so intellectual property becomes an interesting conundrum.

They do give a bit of a wedgie, but the fabric is light and soft enough that I don’t feel it and it isn’t visible under clothes. I wish they were cotton, but the fabric hasn’t given me any problems yet. I’ve been considering Meundies for a similar high rise cheeky cut, but am not thrilled about the price point.  ETA: should have read through all the comments before posting. The Knickey high rise briefs seem to be exactly what I’m looking for.	episode_done:True
text:Underwear review: Soma vs. Parade after 6 months	labels:Wow, I haven’t tried Soma but I did try a bunch from **Parade** and the wedgies from the boy shorts are unbearable and like another commenter said the waist bands get squashed and roll down in the wash.  Would not recommend their underwear, even though I do like their colors and branding.	episode_done:True
text:Underwear review: Soma vs. Parade after 6 months	labels:In terms of lace pilling, I've always had the best luck with Calvin Klein.  They last so long without showing any wear (machine wash, air dry).  Weirdly, I've had good luck with Topshop as well, but availability changes so much, sometimes everything they have looks horrible, sometimes there's lots of cute options.	episode_done:True
text:Underwear review: Soma vs. Parade after 6 months	labels:I've noticed durability issues with Soma undies as well. The fabric thins within a year. If I hold them up to the light, they're transparent. I machine wash and air dry.	episode_done:True
text:Underwear review: Soma vs. Parade after 6 months	labels:I stupidly fell into the Parade trap by an influencer I follow and I really just hate everything about them, and lucky for me I decided to buy 6 during my order lol  I got the re:play thong, the fit is just *bad*. I wear smalls in most underwear, and medium in others so based on them running bigger, I got small. They're loose in the hip/waist, but the crotch part is tight and uncomfortable. The bands are also really apparent under clothes, and there's a seem that gives me sensory rage	episode_done:True
text:Underwear review: Soma vs. Parade after 6 months	labels:I've been looking for better underwear than the 8 pack of crappy ones I got on Amazon! Thanks for the thorough review. I wear mainly pencil skirts, so the panty line problem is real.   I love the realistic models with stretch marks and all. I'm so glad companies are starting to do this more often.	episode_done:True
text:Underwear review: Soma vs. Parade after 6 months	labels:I ordered some Parade and I really like how they look and feel. But their waistband does roll up when washed, it's not an issue when I put them on but I did not expect this problem since they're higher priced than say, Aerie.	episode_done:True

text:I did something very similar with a very different outcome. Saw a dress online, they only had it in stock in the UK shop and not the US shop and, for inexplicable reasons, they shipped from UK to Canada but not UK to US. I shipped the dress to my friend who lives in Montreal and I waited about three months before I could finally get it from her, but, I got it, and I loved it, and I wore it maybe once, and then I sold it. :/ Not my finest moment tbh, but oh well, you live and learn?	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Summer outfit inspiration: An inspo album and 6 lessons on how to make complete outfits even when you are dying of heat stroke	labels:Used to live in US Southwest, temps 100+F in summer.    Clothing depends on what your activity is. If you're just going to the office, layers are key. Pants, short sleeve shirt, blazer/cardigan. Air conditioning can be brutal.   Day to day errands, dresses can be super nice (with safety shorts). DO pick ones that cover your shoulders/back/neck if you can, those areas sunburn very easily!   After the sun goes down, dark colors are fine and will make lighter clothing look more formal.   As someone else mentioned, moisture wicking athleisure can be nice (think tennis/golf polo).  Sneakers work surprisingly well. Sandals are nice, but make sure you don't get sunburn on the tops of your feet. Also don't ever go barefoot, pavement gets hot enough to give you 2nd degree burns in seconds.      Notice how many times I say "after dark" here, there's a reason many cultures with hot summers have a culture of socializing/doing errands in the evening!	episode_done:True

text:How do I find out what I really like and want?	labels:Hey, go on pinterest and keep exploring clothing styles, lookbooks, etc. Pin the ones you like...don't overthink it...they are just pictures; you have nothing to lose. After a while, look at your board and look at the styles that repeat or similarities in what you've chosen. That should give you an idea. It'll take time but don't worry....you subconscious likes and dislikes won't disappear just because you haven't thought about them in a while.	episode_done:True
text:How do I find out what I really like and want?	labels:i would say to just experiment with pieces. when it’s covid safe, go to the mall and try on some stuff in changing rooms. see what “feels like you” and looks right on your body and run with that. style is dynamic, and sometimes you just stop liking things. it happens! i also recommend pinterest, go on there and look at outfits, and pin all the ones you like, then go back and try to notice similarities, either in aesthetic or specific looks. good luck on your style journey!

text:Great minds? Too cheesy? :D	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do I find out what I really like and want?	labels:I feel like others said Pinterest is a good idea. Don’t feel pressured to stick to a certain style though. I don’t feel anybody completely embodies just one single aesthetic, people are more complex then that.   Also as far as making it easy to put cool outfits together I’d say find some colors you like some being neutrals I personally recommend main colors 3 - 6. It’s definitely not necessary but it’s really helped me out personally!   I also feel organizing ones closet in a way you like can make one appreciate there clothes more and easier to style. Like I mentioned before keeping a pretty strict color scheme in my closet is very important to me so I organize mine by article of clothing and in a color gradient.   I was in a similar spot before accept I more willingly just let my mom dress me. I understand how hard it is but now I’ve had my own personal style for 3 years and the amount of growth, and style phases I went through is insane! I made a discussion post about style phases if you want to check it out! I now have a personal style and good sized wardrobe that I am really happy with!	episode_done:True
text:How do I find out what I really like and want?	labels:a little late to the thread, but i would say first and foremost be practical...are you in a warmer or colder environment? Are you a student, or professional? do you go to a lot of fancy restaurants and the like in your free time (pre-covid obv), or are you more outdoorsy? This may seem kind of obvious but you'd be shocked at how many people don't think about these things when they dress, and your lifestyle is really important for creating outfits that you not only like, but will wear often! Pinterest is great but it can also be a little unrealistic sometimes. After you consider practicality its much easier to put together outfits and find things you like that match the occasion. Also, congrats on getting out of your parents' house, and good luck with the search!! you'll do great :)	episode_done:True
text:How do I find out what I really like and want?	labels:To add onto some already really good advice, what you like may not be what you look really good in. This part took me the longest time to figure out. Key here is to keep an open mind. Your likes will probably change every 2-4 years, so when you buy new clothes, take note of whether it compliments with your features,is easy to mix and match with other things in your wardrobe and how wearable it is for your lifestyle. Once you start understanding a bit more about what works for you, even if your style changes over time, you'll know what to avoid or what to look for.	episode_done:True
text:How do I find out what I really like and want?	labels:Loads of good advice already. I would also consider how you want to express yourself and be seen. E.g. Fun? Classic? Quirky? Uncomplicated? Elegant? That sort of thing, do some navel gazing. Do you want to show off your body or obscure it? What looks do you love on other people? What colours and fabrics do you love (or not).	episode_done:True
text:How do I find out what I really like and want?	labels:Go thrift shopping and try on whatever strikes your fancy. I like thrifting for this because just about every cut, color, fabric and style are available and you can get an idea of things you like that are not in new retail stores at the moment. And everything is much cheaper, of course.   All the secondhand stores in my area have closed their dressing rooms, so this isn't as doable right now, but it is still fun to cruise the racks and get an idea for the range of clothing that is out there.   Have fun!	episode_done:True
text:How do I find out what I really like and want?	labels:My advice is to notice what people around you are wearing.  Take notes!  Are you in school?  Glance around the classroom to get ideas.  Do you have a job?  Are your coworkers wearing mostly jeans, or something else?  You can balance that with what you see on pinterest.  I was in a similar boat in that my family was super poor growing up, so I just had to wear whatever was given to me.  It took me a while to figure out what to buy, I would end up in situations where everyone else would be dressed one way and I would be dressed another -- like, say, wearing jeans and a sweater while everyone else was in dressier attire.  It also helps to notice what you find yourself wearing a lot.  For example, if you start with two pairs of shoes, heels and sneakers, and you notice you wear your sneakers way more, then you've learned: you should own more sneakers than heels.	episode_done:True
text:How do I find out what I really like and want?	labels:Like everyone said Pinterest is a good place to start. Maybe start by looking at what you find yourself picking out of your current wardrobe for casual days and days you feel like dressing up and see how you would want those styles to evolve since you’re a young adult now! I follow a lot of fashion you tubers as well and there’s a variety of trendy (bestdressed)/minimalist(Gemary)/ grunge(Sarah Hawkinson)/tomboy(madeyoulooks) style channels. I also find myself taking inspo from tv show characters.	episode_done:True
text:How do I find out what I really like and want?	labels:My situation was the opposite as far as I know me and my sister were allowed to choose to wear what we wanted from as early as I remember.

I'm in my early 30s now and I think I finally found my style, but I'm struggling to feel amazing about it as I'm a bit overweight and I think things that I like simply look better on slimmer women.  Anyhow: I experimented loads as a teen and ever since, really. Buying things, wearing them or not, making things. It takes time to figure out which of the things you own get a lot of wear and which don't. You could go to second hand shops as it's cheaper to buy more here to experiment with. A lot also depends on any demands from your job, if you currently work. If you can freely wear whatever, you can go nuts. Some things that are great staples irrespective of style are some quality black leggings, nice trainers, good tops or bras for support, a nice handbag, backpack, and a few nice coats.  You could flip through magazines or websites and save any photos of style that appeals to you or simply individual pieces you like. Look at people in the street and take notes of any insights you gain from that.  I was very into goth stuff for daily wear until I went to art school and didn't want to get nice clothes dirty so I ended up wearing sports/athleisure gear. Now that I have a working from home office job I'm just wearing athleisure)chill stuff too but when I go out I try to dress in my style, which I've accepted is boho/eclectic/a mix. I've stopped trying to find a style and I'll just wear individual things I like, so I end up with a lot going on at times (big coat, patterned leggings, coloured trainers, hippie jewellery, an army style cross body bag etc. That's just me. I'm happy to look a bit strange and not according to one style.  You'll get there :).	episode_done:True

text:How do deal with being pressure to find “classics” and “timeless pieces” when you feel your style is constantly changing?	labels:Simple. Just buy whatever you want to and don’t worry about what you’re “expected” to buy.	episode_done:True
text:How do deal with being pressure to find “classics” and “timeless pieces” when you feel your style is constantly changing?	labels:Buy whatever it is that is a useful / most worn item as your staple.

text:How do deal with being pressure to find “classics” and “timeless pieces” when you feel your style is constantly changing?	labels: This seems like more of a psychological problem than a fashion problem. People tend to have different priorities and motivators. For some people, “fitting in”, “meeting societal expectations”, and things like that are very important. To other people, “Being true to yourself,” and “being individual” and other things like that are quite important. A lot of people end up straddling both though, and the decisions that you make should depend on the values you identify for yourself.   We are very influenced by the values of those around us, so you may feel this disconnect because what you value may not be the same as what your friends value, or what your parents value, or what people on the internet value. But we feel influenced by the values of others anyway if we want those people to like us. So what you should do is identify which things come from yourself and which things come from other people, and then which values out of that whole set you really want to embody. If you can label this more firmly, it may help to ‘own’ whatever decisions you make regardless of the values or expectations of other people.  It’s also important to remember that you can’t please everyone. People who value timelessness, elegance, and classic pieces might look at other people and describe their outfits as tacky, childish, too trendy, etc. Meanwhile those other people are looking at the timeless/classic people and describing their outfits as boring, aging, and bland. Neither camp is really better or worse, it’s just a different perspective - and it’s not like there are only two camps. But there’s no way to please everyone - so you just need to confidence to choose what you want to wear for reasons that feel right to you and then you need to own that choice.	episode_done:True
text:How do deal with being pressure to find “classics” and “timeless pieces” when you feel your style is constantly changing?	labels:I think I figured out how to ditch that pressure after I realized that I didn't like most items in all those "10 things every girl should have in her closet" listicles. I know that's less about trendiness, but it is about realizing that "classic" pieces really aren't for everyone.  It sank in even more when I got older and truly experienced how today's "classic" is tomorrow's "dated": Trust me, in 20 years no one's going to think those silk blouses, ankle-length pants, and button-down dresses really were the end all be all of timeless fashion, no matter how plain and minimalist they look to young eyes today.   That doesn't mean fast fashion is great, if only because the business model is unsustainable in a plethora of ways. But that's not something wrong with your preference for novelty! People have always liked novelty in their clothes, it just wasn't doable to buy tons of completely new garments so they made smaller changes. Buying less really is a good thing for the world, but "buy it for life" is a nonstarter for women's fashion unless you're a true ascetic.	episode_done:True
text:How do deal with being pressure to find “classics” and “timeless pieces” when you feel your style is constantly changing?	labels:When I was entering adulthood I mostly just bought secondhand clothes to experiment with and then resold them when I got bored or the trend was done (or if they didn't work for me). My "timeless classics" are pretty much just the experiments that worked - pieces that stayed in rotation or got so much use I needed to replace them with something similar later on, etc. I do keep on experimenting with little trends here and there, but it's also a nice comfort to have my classics around to mix in.	episode_done:True
text:How do deal with being pressure to find “classics” and “timeless pieces” when you feel your style is constantly changing?	labels:There's no pressure? Buy what you want, wear what you want. That's what I do, and I've been an adult for a few decades now. A wardrobe that contains (also, or mostly, or some, depending on your preference) timeless pieces, is something that builds over time. You don't just go shopping one day and get it all a-la-Pretty-Woman.	episode_done:True
text:How do deal with being pressure to find “classics” and “timeless pieces” when you feel your style is constantly changing?	labels:Wear. Whatever. You. Want. Life is short, fashion is fun, don't build a closet around what others think is acceptable to wear or own.	episode_done:True
text:How do deal with being pressure to find “classics” and “timeless pieces” when you feel your style is constantly changing?	labels:What pressure? There's a pressure not to dress like a child when you're an adult, and I guess that intersects with trend-following, but it's not the same thing. Most fashion brands make their money selling to adults not kids.  While you can't quite 'wear what you like' and still be socially acceptable everywhere, you can most certainly follow fashion if that's what you want to do.	episode_done:True
text:How do deal with being pressure to find “classics” and “timeless pieces” when you feel your style is constantly changing?	labels:I buy/wear items that I like, whether they are in style or not, whether they are considered classic or not. For example, I love high waist pants and maxi skirts - both were "trendy" a couple years ago and I'm so glad they were produced more as a result. I will keep wearing them even though they're no longer trendy, because I love how they look and feel, even if no one else is wearing them.   Another example for me: neutral colors are considered classic, as well as patterns like plaid and houndstooth. But I love fun colors and funky patterns, so those are what I wear most, no matter if others are wearing different styles.  Just because something is labeled classic or trendy by social media, fashion brands, retailers, etc. doesn't mean that we have to adhere to them. You can wear whatever style you like, whenever you like, regardless if others woild label those items trendy or classic.	episode_done:True
text:How do deal with being pressure to find “classics” and “timeless pieces” when you feel your style is constantly changing?	labels:IMO there is \*almost\* no such thing as classic and timeless.  Just buy the things that you like, it's fine if you like trends and your style changes over time.  The idea that you become and adult and you must ditch trends is an internet myth, if you look at actual people (adults) that have some interest in style/fashion - they are following trends.  Maybe not in the same way or timeline as teenagers but they are not just wearing white buttons and trench coats all the time.  And even if they were, white button downs and trench coats are not exactly the same now as they were ten or twenty or thirty years ago.	episode_done:True

I have an athletic build - big thighs, an ass, but not an enormous waist (but not hourglass, I'm rectangular by all definitions), and finding jeans that fit or even come close to fitting is a challenge. I don't want skinny jeans and am just fine with a high waist, but when I sit I need to not feel constricted and they need some stretch to accommodate my legs and butt. I went to my favorite denim boutique for a personalized shopping experience and tried on just about everything in my size. I bought some jeans, but they're still not what I was looking for. My favorite is my husband's old ass sevens that have a huge hole in the ass (that I still wear out in public because why not), but they're not super flattering, just comfy.	episode_done:True

text:Does anyone have tips on how to find good stuff from Poshmark and other online thrift shopping platforms?	labels:eBay:  - Filter by fabric content. Try searching for wool, silk, cashmere, and other nice fabrics.  - There’s a filter for vintage that’s useful for finding unique items. Also make sure to look at sizes that you may think would be too big. Vintage clothing tends to run much smaller.  - Avoid stuff labeled as “unbranded” its mostly just cheap junk mass produced in China that is heavily advertised on eBay  for some reason - Make use of the extensive filters eBay has, you can use them to find very specific items.    Poshmark:  - Sort by recently price dropped. This means the seller is really trying to get rid of the item and you can get a better price.  - Don’t be afraid to make an offer. I’ve made offers I thought the seller would never accept, but they did and I got some great items for insane deals.  - Search by key words, the filters are not as good as eBay  - You can filter by your specific sizes, but I don’t recommend this on Poshmark. The system does not work well. For example, I put my dress sizes as 4 and 6, and they only show me dresses labeled those sizes while leaving out dresses labeled small or medium.   In general for online thrifting: - Ask the seller for measurements if they aren’t posted already, and compare to clothes you have that fit well.  - Filter by size, color, or brand to find more specific items.  - Create saved searches if there’s a specific thing you want that you can’t find
text:For Poshmark sizing, you can also select sizes small and medium. So I usually check the pant size (26/28) “dress size” (2/4) and the regular size (s/m) to get all of the items in my size!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone have tips on how to find good stuff from Poshmark and other online thrift shopping platforms?	labels:I shop a lot on Poshmark and I find it helps to think of it as “slow” fashion.

I save things by liking them and wait to see if the seller will make me a reasonable offer. People sometimes give amazing deals if something has been sitting long enough.   As others have said, use those filters!
text:I've been able to get some great deals by finding a specific item I'm interested in and then doing a new search for just that item. I look through the available listings and if they're all in the same or similar condition I like all of the lower priced ones and wait for the offers to come in.  I do sometimes make offers myself, kinda depends on how much I want the item and how unique it is. Like, I'm much more likely to make an offer on something vintage that I know I won't easily find another of. I have one in my likes right now I'm waffling on but I really do want it. For offers, typically you can expect to make an opening offer around 50-60% of the list price and still be considered reasonable, especially in reseller closets. (Full disclosure I do flip on PM as a small side hustle, I mostly use the funds to buy new things for myself.) There's a 20% commission fee and the shipping discount comes out of the seller's pocket, so they generally list higher to account for these in their profit margins. If I'm lazy and just want the item sometimes I just make an offer that essentially gives myself free shipping lol, better margin for the seller so they're more likely to accept.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone have tips on how to find good stuff from Poshmark and other online thrift shopping platforms?	labels:I pretty much exclusively buy second hand/ thrifted clothes as I can get MUCH better quality clothing than if I were to buy new. I tend to buy off eBay, depop and vinted. I search for the brands I live pretty frequently (just the brand name, no other filters) then see newly listed items. I regularly pick up sezane, self-portrait, COS, Claudie Pierlot items at really low prices. It helps when people don't know the brand so well (Claudie Pierlot for example- just bought a perfect condition puffer jacket RRP £350, currently on the outnet for £169...I got it for £15.) Or for example a brand new La Perla full length night dress for £20.  I think it helps that I also sell a lot, so if an item isn't quite right I sell it on.	episode_done:True

text:Does anyone have tips on how to find good stuff from Poshmark and other online thrift shopping platforms?	labels:Filters are your friend. I like to start with brand - otherwise the search is way too broad and overwhelming. If you fill in your sizing the app will automatically filter out things that will not fit you (which culls the list quite a bit). If you find an item you like try looking through the seller’s other listings as well- often I’ll find other items that appeal to my taste or discover new brands this way. I think you can suss out a lot about the seller based on the way they describe the items & pics they take too - someone who just Marie kondo’d their closet will have different kinds of items than someone who sells as a side hustle  The big appeal to me is the thrill of the hunt!! Happy shopping :)	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone have tips on how to find good stuff from Poshmark and other online thrift shopping platforms?	labels:I have a really hard time shopping on poshmark. I find I have to be super specific and it's not great for browsing. For instance "j crew tan cashmere cardigan" gets a manageable result but "flowy top" does not. I also uncheck boutique as that's all cheap stuff from china and search by brand when I have one in mind.   Ebay is has more filters which helps to narrow items down. I usually filter by material and country (only shop within the us since that's where I am, this gets rid of all the new stuff from china).  Also, I would definitely recommend thredup because you can return things. I recently placed my first order from them and ended up returning about half of it. They charge $2 per return and for free shipping you have to take store credit, which I think is fair and way better than just being stuck with something that doesn't fit. You can set up saved searches to make it easy to check for new items and also filter by brand/material/size/condition and sort by newest first.   Depop is also worth checking out, I find it to be a bit more curated and trendy than poshmark but often overpriced. There are less items so searching is more manageable, and search results are based on an algorithm (poshmark is just newest first). Also shipping is cheaper for small/light things.  Another one people are into is the real real, I haven't ordered from them myself but have seen it recommended. I think it's pretty much a higher end thredup.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone have tips on how to find good stuff from Poshmark and other online thrift shopping platforms?	labels:Some really great tips here! Here's my two cents:  1) If the seller doesn't respond to your questions, RESIST the urge to buy anyway. This seems really obvious, but I've made the mistake many times of panic-buying b/c I was afraid I'd miss out on the item, against my better judgment. Someone else may snap it up, but you've saved yourself the headache of wasting money on something that doesn't fit/is damaged/itchy/smells like cigarette smoke/etc.   2) Poshmark and eBay work better when you are familiar with the exact brand and model of clothing. They're not great for browsing due to just too much crap and too much inconsistency in the listings. If you don't really know what you want, I'd suggest browsing TheRealReal. They skew higher-end, but have a quite a lot of choice and have filtered out the trash and no-name brands already. Often you can find really rock-bottom prices for what you're getting (like Rag & Bone jeans for $30). You can search for something like "women's wool trousers" and then filter by size and color and sometimes style (cropped, wide-leg, etc). You'll be exposed to a lot of brands and styles you may not otherwise have thought of. Another pro (or con, depending on how you look at it), is that the clothing sizes are broken down into XS/S/M/L/XL categories, rather than numerical. So if you filter by "S" it will include 26-27 jeans, 34-36 Euro sizing, 40-42 IT size, etc., which is good when you're dealing with international brands. Even better is when the item includes measurements, which they often do, which are always more helpful than a number on a tag. Finally, on full-priced items (except for the really high end stuff), you can automatically get 20% by using their REAL code.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone have tips on how to find good stuff from Poshmark and other online thrift shopping platforms?	labels:Poshmark filters suck, but the fact that you can ask the seller for more details and they can offer you discounts means that you can find great things!  I find that if I like something, about 30% of the time the seller will offer me a discount right away, so start going crazy on the likes if you are ready to purchase something.  I always sort by new so you get first pick of the best stuff.    I search for specific fabrics, but this doesn't work perfectly on Poshmark.  I love linen, so I often just type "linen" into the search bar and see what I find.  The problem is that Poshmark doesn't have a fabric filter, so "linen-looking" items will end up in there, and sellers that don't list fabric won't show up there.  But I've found awesome pieces this way!  "My size" straight up doesn't work for me.  It's annoying, but I always manually pick my size once I get to a category.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone have tips on how to find good stuff from Poshmark and other online thrift shopping platforms?	labels:As someone who makes a decent amount of money casually flipping niche designers, it's become a bit of an arms race of bots/scrapers/market data warehousing for finding true steals.   Focusing on one or two designers (monobrand4lyfe) and learning the market well enough to flip items and pay for your retail purchase of what you _actually_ want is almost more reliable than hoping you find what fourteen seasons past item in your size in good condition.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone have tips on how to find good stuff from Poshmark and other online thrift shopping platforms?	labels:For Ebay, filter by "auction" vs "buy it now"    If I search for womens cashmere sweater size medium filtering by auction will take search results from 130,000 to 1,900. Much easier to peruse.	episode_done:True

text:Do You Ever See A Cute Outfit, Try To Replicate It And End Up Hating It On Yourself? How Did You Fix That? Did You Ever Get The Answer As To Why It Didn't "Look Right" On You?	labels:I’m at the upper end of straight size, and wore plus sizes for a bit a few years ago, which is where I developed this habit: if I want to see how a trend might look on me, I look up “how to style [item or trend] plus size” or “plus size ootd [item or trend]” or something like that. That way I can see if it actually looks good on people who aren’t tall and thin or if it’s one of those things where it’s designed specifically for that fashion model body type. It’s been really helpful for me in figuring out what I can and can’t “pull off.”	episode_done:True

I’ve also got broad shoulders due to lifting and a naturally muscular build while also being slim, but I’m also only 4’11, so I have to shop in petites.  Most petites are first of all still not short enough for someone under 5 feet (like, why is 5’4 considered petite?), and second are cut narrower, which is the opposite of what I need.  I typically end up with pants with stretch so it fits at my waist while also fitting around my thighs and sweaters/tops that are a size or two too big for my stomach so that my shoulders don’t look ridiculous.	episode_done:True
text:Do You Ever See A Cute Outfit, Try To Replicate It And End Up Hating It On Yourself? How Did You Fix That?

I’ll put on something that’s risky or different from my usual fits and think it looks awful. All I see is how it is too tight in the bust or emphasizes my waist, then I take it off and move back to safer ground.   My husband’s favorite dress on me... I was going to return it, when he saw me trying it on and told me to pick a restaurant. I still don’t love the dress on, but he swears it looks amazing on me. (And he does not shy away from expressing negative opinions).   I’m just saying, sometimes we see what we expect to see. And getting a second opinion is worth it, because that look might really “look right” on you. It just might not be what you are used to seeing.	episode_done:True

text:Do You Ever See A Cute Outfit, Try To Replicate It And End Up Hating It On Yourself? How Did You Fix That?

I’m tall-ish but also apple shaped and broad shouldered with narrow hips and no waist. (Also officially overweight, thanks quarantine)   I think what helped is that i started following a lot of OOTD accounts from people here on ffa from waywt and the midsize and plus-size style hashtags on Instagram. These helped me normalize seeing confident, stylish people in different sizes and now if/when I try to emulate their style, I’m less disappointed. If you look at @timorous.me on Instagram she has a style blogger index where you can search for people of similar measurements to you. It’s helped me a lot.	episode_done:True
text:Do You Ever See A Cute Outfit, Try To Replicate It And End Up Hating It On Yourself? How Did You Fix That? Did You Ever Get The Answer As To Why It Didn't "Look Right" On You?	labels:try to mimic in your clothes what your body does, but more in terms of structure and sharp vs soft lines rather than "broad hips need x". If you have a sharp bone structure, try sharp and crisp styles, if you look fleshy go with soft draping fabrics, if you look short then split the silhouette by colors or a belt. These are just examples but they can be extended to anything. This is basically what the kibbe system does. You can apply this idea without going into the whole thing as it can be a bit of a rabbit hole.	episode_done:True
text:Do You Ever See A Cute Outfit, Try To Replicate It And End Up Hating It On Yourself? How Did You Fix That? Did You Ever Get The Answer As To Why It Didn't "Look Right" On You?	labels:Yes. I’m kind of somewhere between an hourglass and an inverted triangle shape, and only 5’4. So many outfits online have like 4 layers on top and then my shoulders look huge and it’s not cute. Or I look like a big blob because they billow out over my round hips/butt rather than draping all pretty like the stick thin girl I saw the look on online.   I wouldn’t say I have “solved” it but I’ve found a few ways to imitate the looks I like more successfully. Finding a slightly cropped version of a blazer or sweater I admire is helpful given my height, and also because I have hips and a round butt, long sweaters and blazers tend to look boxy and strange on me. I have also been learning about and experimenting with tucking shirts and sweaters a lot. Finally, minimizing layers or choosing blazers and sweaters that don’t have dropped shoulder seams helps keep my top half looking sleek. Unfortunately dropped shoulders seem to be all the rage everywhere I shop 🙄  I know you’re pear shaped so it’s different but I think you can look at the “vibe” of an outfit and imitate it in a way that suits your body. Mainly I try to look at a few outfits I’m drawn to, and figure out what elements they have in common or what it is that I’m liking. Maybe the colors, textures, silhouettes, etc. I like to save them on Pinterest and make note of what I want to find when I shop to pull those elements into my wardrobe.	episode_done:True

text:You’re definitely right, I just think I won’t know if a luxury bag will make me happy until I actually finally own one. For now it’s like chasing a dream I’ve never been able to attain on my own before and idk if it’s achieving the dream or the actual bag that I want.	labels:I definitely know this feeling, but it sounded like you weren't all that impressed by the quality of the  luxury bags when you went to look at them.  Maybe think of it like this as a test to see if it's the bag or the achievement of a milestone. If this bag (luxury or not) was found in a thrift store, and you couldn't find it in the store of the brand or online, and you left the thrift store without it, would you be worried that someone else would buy it before you? Or would you have a feeling of "meh, I'll find something similar?" If you would be worried about missing out on it forever, you want the bag.   You could also buy the super pricey Prada (or what ever luxury brand) and if having actually bought it feels wrong, you could return it.  But I totally understand wanting to have tangible reoresentations of the milestones you hit in life. Mine is one day being a home owner and not just a renter, and I really get excited at the thought of finding a space (not necessarily big, beautiful, or expensive) and making it mine.
text:Replying to this a week late, but for future reference most high end designer stores do not give refunds. They will allow store credit, but that defeats the purpose.  It’s weird though because some take returns if you purchased online (YSL), but not in store.

text:I’ve actually thought a lot about who I’m trying to impress with the logo and the short answer is, I don’t really know. None of my main circle would care either way.

But I don't personally get buying something *just* because it is a certain brand. Who are you trying to impress? What are you conveying with that logo (wow, you're well off? What kind of message is that, on its own?) I just feel like people who are super into labels, not the design or the style or anything else, just come across as kind of immature? The truth is, anyone worth spending much time with isn't overly concerned with what logo your bag has. (Now! I will concede there is a difference between showing off luxury brands and having higher end items, in some circles. Like, there could be some tension if you're hanging out with super millionaire socialites and everything you wear is from TJ Maxx...but in that case, I'd still say its important to focus on personal style first. And knowing about smaller higher end designers, rather than designers you can buy at a mall, is a whole different thing too...)
text:I’ve actually thought a lot about who I’m trying to impress with the logo and the short answer is, I don’t really know. None of my main circle would care either way. The longer answer is I think I’m really trying to impress myself. Maybe show to myself that I’m successful and can afford it? Show myself I worked hard for it and was able to attain it because I wanted it? I don’t know it’s a tough question which is why I struggle on if the bag is worth the cost even if I can afford it.	labels:The best part of being able to afford something is that you can also afford to not buy it and just wait until you fall in love with a bag.	episode_done:True
text:Interesting article on luxury fashion made in Italy.	labels:I remember reading this article a few months ago, agree with u/jameane re: Deluxe. It's a good read. Luxury is so secretive about their supply chain and manufacturing that you cannot really get a good sense of who is crafting your goods and whether it's ethically done. Shit, I'll probably still buy a luxury item once in a while, but my eyes are a lot more open to exactly how much I am paying for the *experience* rather than the goods themselves.	episode_done:True

text:Interesting article on luxury fashion made in Italy.	labels:I think ethical concerns are at the root of most luxury brands, we just don't see it. Whether that be material sourcing, animal cruelty, slave or child labour/wages etc.  One would have to go out of their way quite a bit to avoid brands that operate like this. Even Nike etc is the same story.

text:Distinct Fashion Phases	labels:Absolutely. I’ve gotten much better at buying for what I’ll actually wear vs aspiring to look like how the models (or influencers) look. I spent a fortune at Anthropologie from 2005-2010 and gorgeous dresses, most of which i never ended up wearing. I never really wore makeup.  From 2010-2012, I moved into Urban Outfitters basic-ness, trying to be a bit more edgy. This is when I started wearing winged liner every day.  From 2012-2016, I was all about Banana Republic, because of wanting to appear professional, but was so bored with my wardrobe. I toned down my liner but added neutral eye shadow.  From 2016-2018, I almost exclusively wore athleisure because of my work switching from business casual to casual. I was comfy af though. Minimal makeup all the way.  From 2018 on, I’ve limited myself to second hand shopping. My look is much more eclectic now, but I find the items I buy feel more like treasures to me. I wear everything in my closet and I’ve got a much more streamlined approach to shopping. If it’s not made of a natural material, I don’t buy it. If it’s not black, white, grey, blue, burgundy, or yellow, I don’t buy it. If a skirt isn’t an A-line silhouette, I don’t buy it. These hard stops have prevented me from making the same fashion mistakes over and over again. I’m a more efficient shopper and my wardrobe stays cohesive.   I’ve definitely experienced a glow-up with makeup, though. I feel like I’ve really nailed down the look I like and I wear it every single day - tinted moisturizer with SPF, neutral satin eyeshadow, winged liner, peachy blush, eyebrow pencil, and tinted chapstick. It takes me 5 min in total to do this look. I never get bored of it, either. When I have to do a presentation, I’ll wear bold red lips and that adds enough variety for me to feel like I’ve spiced it up.
text:I’m a huge fan of A- line skirts too. I find them quite flattering!   Same with red lips they are timeless and always a good move!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Distinct Fashion Phases	labels:Oh no. Until I was 24 I either wore jeans + sweatshirt or full business formal and nothing in between. I had like 6 JCrew pantsuits when I was 14 because I did extracurriculars like mock trial and speech. I sold or donated my suit separates, because I don’t work in an environment where most of them would be suitable (I used to be an accountant, now I’m a sommelier). I’ve never been consistent in wearing makeup but I stopped tweezing my eyebrows.   I have one pair of jeans now, since I prefer wilder colors and styles (I have a lot of very funky flare pants now). I guess it’s on-trend now but I don’t like it because it’s on trend. I have one scarf I bought when I was 16 that I am wearing right now and will wear for the rest of my life, and a ring I bought when I was 12, but I haven’t had any clothes for longer than 2 years.	episode_done:True
text:Distinct Fashion Phases	labels:I definitely went through a lot of style changes too!  Middle School- I wore what was “in.” Tight t shirts from Aeropostale and sweatpants from Abercrombie.   High school- I geared more toward my current look. Jeans and t shirts, or dresses and leggings/tights if the weather allowed. I was very much an Ann Taylor/Loft fan because of their petite sizing. Sometimes I wore slacks and t shirts because slacks are more comfortable than jeans imo.  College (right now.)- I wear a lot of things similar to what you described as your current style! Not nearly as often as I’d like due to weather and dresses aren’t always practical. I did just get a bunch of new stuff from Collectif if 40s/50s vintage inspired clothes are up your alley. They have a big sale right now too! I also would check out shoes from American Duchess and Remix Vintage if they’re in your price range	episode_done:True
text:Distinct Fashion Phases	labels:I’m Op but I’ll share mine -  At around 14 I had a quick phase of really liking the very early sort of e- kid bright and trendy fashion. Hot topic forever 21 sort of edgy stuff. Skinny jeans only. Small wardrobe. Didn’t look great and got bullied a little for my new look. Lowkey wanted to look like a gorillaz character. Still kinda do though lol.  Then there was a transitional trendy masculine street wear phase from when I was late 14 to late 15 . I only really wore ripped jeans, graphic tees , always a belt , with vans or converse that matched the shirt. I started getting of compliments on my style from peers.  I then had an art kid style phase late 15 - 16 years old . Very similar to before but I started adding different style jackets and pants. This was an important phase because I started adding different accessories like print socks and hair stuff.   Really quick 90’s inspired phase. I tried dressing like 90’s Britpop singers lol. A small step back I’d say.   Late 16 to current ( I’m seventeen ) changed my style over quarantaine . Asking questions here changed everything. I realized how much I loved my more dressy clothes and fell in love with the l’ecole des femmes clothes. I stopped following trends and went for mature more romantic and currently Victorian styles. Man repeller slightly masculine inspiration too. I wear skirts, tights , blazers, dresses, hats, neck scarves and blouses now. I also sold my years worth of converse and vans to buy oxfords and heeled dress shoes. Though my peers understand it a little less I have never been happier. Very confident in my style currently.    [Quick note - It may seem crazy to change my style so quickly but when your young you tend to go through clothes more quickly as you grow and teens tend to be more rough on clothes ]   Thank you for reading : )
text:I love this because I had almost the complete opposite transition. I went from aspiring to have a slightly dressy, classic style 14-16, and then in the past year and a half (17 now too lol), I had a drastic shift towards recognizing that as put together as dressier styles look, it’s not for me.   Luckily, I barely had any clothes anyway, so heading off to college soon, I decided to focus on what I actually value (comfort above all, feeling like myself in clothes, and replacing things I currently wear a ton) and now find myself in a much more colorful (unless i’m feeling all black), streetwear-esque look. Yesterday, I wore an outfit that I can’t stop grinning about today, and that never used to happen before. Absolutely ecstatic getting to play with clothes in a way that isn’t 100% “trendy” and is just more *me*.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Distinct Fashion Phases	labels:1.  yes, I wear some items from 5+ years ago, but I style them differently.  2. I'm 21. At 13 I wore lots of neons, but I basiclly did it to annoy my teacher who said bright colours are slutty (yes, I find it confusing too)  At 14 I switched schools and dressed like a  1960s stoner. I realized quickly I wasn't into it and that I was just copying people around me.  15-18 was grunge. Docs, faded denim jackets, jeans with 42 holes in then, plaid skater skirts . I dressed like it was 2012 when it was actually 2015-2018, but for a change I was dressing for myself, without intentions to annoy/ conform to people.   18-21 got a job where I had to wear black every day , as a result I was sick of grunge.  I started weating more colours, and becsme intrested in both 1940s snd 1970s fashion.   3 . It took me a long time to switch to grunge because that was my first real style that I built up, but switching to my current style was easier and quicker.  4 . I don't really dress trendy. If I notice a trend I really Iike I buy it, but I'm ok with wearing absulotly untrendy things.

text:Are Luxury Fashion Brands Becoming Like Fast Fashion?	labels:I'd say to some degree yes. Most fashion houses are rtw/couture first and accessories second. They dipped into the handbag and accessories market to make more money, but the real quality (and bread and butter) for most fashion houses is their rtw.   Chanel is in this weird spot where they're trying to outrun the secondhand market and regain the exclusivity they once had. They're trying to be Hermes but they could never be Hermes because Chanel is not known for their leather.   So yes, I think when it comes to handbags/SLGs/accessories most luxury houses are trying to put out the latest and greatest and kind of mimic fast fashion to some degree. They're appealing to a market that can't afford to become their regular clientele. The people whom they can't text when the latest $7000 tweed jacket is released each season and know that they can walk away with a $10,000+ sale. So brands are trying to push out the latest and greatest handbags, SLGs and shoes.   In terms of rtw, I do think the traditional fashion calendar is very fast paced, but several brands have said they will step away from the traditional calendar and cut it back down to 2-3 releases per year. It will be interesting to see what this means for S/S and F/W collections.   Commenting more on the handbag/accessories market:  I say this as someone is kind of handbag crazy, but I do wish people would do more research about the brands and bags they purchase. People assume that just because a bag is marked up it's handmade by an artisan who specializes in leather but that isn't the case for most brands.   If anyone is looking for Hermes alternatives I highly suggest Delvaux. Valextra and Moynat also have fantastic craftsmanship. But I bought my first box leather bag from Delvaux last year and it's on a completely different level from Chanel.

text:Are Luxury Fashion Brands Becoming Like Fast Fashion?	labels:I also feel like this holds true.

Less craftsmanship and no real effort concerning environmental effects or lowering their carbon footprint.   It’s a shame and I think the whole industry needs big change.

text:Are Luxury Fashion Brands Becoming Like Fast Fashion?	labels:Any time you're paying more than a few thousand dollars for a basic article of clothing, you're paying for the brand; because you could have that same blazer or pair of trousers custom made by a tailor/dressmaker in the same or better quality, for a lower price.  This was the case in the 50s and 60s as well, but at the time, high quality clothing was more common, sewing skills were more common, clothes were expected to last longer, and the general public had a better understanding of what good-quality clothing looks like; people bought Chanel expecting quality construction, of course, but the main appeal of buying from a prominent Parisian fashion house was knowing that anything Chanel made would be in fashion for the upcoming years.  Now that we are immersed in fast fashion, nobody has the knowledge to hold luxury brands accountable, and fashions change so quickly that a well-made 'up-to-date' jacket from a reliably fashionable brand would be a pointless investment.  It just doesn't make sense anymore for luxury brands to invest too much on quality if there is no longer any demand for quality.  This is not *only* a recent thing: I've seen gowns from the court of Marie Antoinette made of materials costing 30+ years of a working man's wages, yet were hastily thrown together with big, sloppy stitches and tacks.  That's just what happens when your client wants their garment *right now* and will only wear it once or twice.  If you want something that's really well-made and is going to last a long time, there is certainly a market niche for that, but it's become more of a middle-class niche for people who *specifically* care about quality and durability.

text: "regain the exclusivity they once had" - Is that possible? Chanel has too many brand ambassadors that just doesn't scream Chanel.	labels:I think they’re headed in the right direction with all of their price increases. When Chanel increases their prices, the prices on the secondhand market go up. So I guess that’s kind of on their side. On the purse forum, people say the goal is for the jumbo flap to be 10K.   I think it’s fine for Chanel to evolve from the Lagerfeld era.
text:They need to evolve and create a new identity post Lagerfeld era. It does need a revamp so I understand why they want to go back to exclusivity but they also need ambassadors who fit that image as well.	labels:I think once there’s an established image they decide they want. Brands have to evolve to cater to other demographics and markets, especially the eastern market. So of course their ambassadors will be more diverse in style/taste.

I was intrigued by the idea of taking a photo a day as some sort of time capsule/chronicle and started taking outfit photos when it was somewhat shameful and indulgent (at least to me then) but now I have a whole archive of outfits from ten years ago.

When I think of Fendi, I'm not a fan due to the overt branding on the baguettes. I don't think this collection really strikes me as interesting, though I am a fan of look 31 and the blue piping detail. The graphics also don't excite me a ton, except for the cursive Fendi coat in 23 (and I actually love the pop of the turtleneck and gloves and piping - so whimsical!) This collection confuses me as it's simultaneously very muted but also funky, but I don't feel as though there's cohesive messaging.

text:You definitely have a point. While this collection leans more graffiti, I think the rest of his art is a bit more abstract than a lot of graffiti art I’ve seen (though in fairness I don’t follow the graffiti scene closely), and the sweater vests and puffy coat showcase that for me. Maybe I’m just excited because I’ve been eyeing some of his art prints and now his art is available in the form of fashion. I’m also very curious to see how they will translate the colab to RTW and if there will be additional prints that pop up there.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Noel Fielding X Fendi menswear colab	labels:I think Noel Fielding's art work is fun, and he is a very fun, odd dude. I loved him in IT Crowd, and he's weird as ever in the B. Baking series.   His Fendi graphics are arguably the better items in the fashion show, but wouldn't it be just as good if they used another contemporary artist? I feel that this type of graphics can be interchangeable. Any local graffiti artist could do something interesting. Noel is just famous.
text:> Noel is just famous.  I think part of the reason for this kind of collab is that the collaborator brings their followers to the audience for the clothing company’s work.  There are a lot of choices for customers out there nowadays, and to sell high end things you first have to get people to look at them.  Fielding‘s signature look is playful and casual, but still meticulous and of high quality.  For the well-paid WFH crowd, who are no longer spending their clothing budget on daily office wear, I think this collab is a good marketing strategy.  Plus, I like the bold colors, and the cozy tactile stuff - high fashion but comfy - is really perfect right now.	labels:[INVALID]	episode_done:True
text:Women who have revamped your entire wardrobe — how did that go? What is your advice for the rest of us?	labels:I found myself at age 27 having lost every good pieces I ever owned, had gained 32 lbs, and was wearing the same two pairs of leggings from Ross basically every day. I’m 32 going on 33 now and have built a beautiful new style, I don’t have everything, but a lot of great wearable pieces.  My advice is to start with what you’re missing in that moment, and buy ahead for the season when you can.   Do not try to buy everything at once!  Pay close attn to materials (what you like vs. don’t) and remember to look for that when shopping online. Things that will last and are versatile.   Accessories are fun 🤩 invest in pants shoes and bags and jewelry!  Don’t just buy things because they are on sale, be thoughtful about what you’re choosing.   Do not be afraid to buy things oversized!  I was so afraid to up size for so long that I ended up with tshirts I never wear sweatpants sweatshirts, jackets etc. even SHOES!   Which brings me to my last point, remember to bring socks when trying on boots!  Xoxo 😘	episode_done:True
text:Women who have revamped your entire wardrobe — how did that go? What is your advice for the rest of us?	labels:Can I just ask why “as few pieces as possible” is the goal and not, say, “every piece in my wardrobe has a clear function or two, and sometimes that function is ‘because I feel like it’ or ‘because sequins make me happy?’”  A wardrobe you like is one that lets you be properly equipped for everything in your life and gives you a nice little aesthetic pick-me-up while you do it.   Before even shopping, I’d say: Look at your life. What do you do at work? What do you do in the community for volunteer work? How’s your social life? Are you outdoorsy? Do you have messy hobbies? Do your hobbies include going out to clubs and live shows and festivals? How often are you running meetings, speaking with elected officials, serving on committees? How often are you attending religious services, religious rites of passage, or big-deal family events like weddings?  Start with taking an inventory of your time and what you need your closet to do to help you be as prepared as possible for how you spend that time. Identify the holes in your working wardrobe, like “I need a good outfit for going to funerals” or “I need a warm weather first-day-at-the-new-job look.” Then you can settle questions of personal style, budget and what items fit more than one situation in your life.

Who cares so long as the final product looks good??	labels:There are tons of valid reasons for wanting or needing a smaller wardrobe, for sure! But one thing that doesn't come up in the conversation often (at least that I've seen, and it was something that honestly didn't occur to me until I'd been seeing these conversations for a long time) is *laundry*. Like, if you have only a handful of items, do you also have the time and space to do washing at least once a week? That could mean having to go to a laundromat or it could mean handwashing in a sink and hanging things to dry. If you have an in-home washer and dryer (or at least washer) it's a little different, but otherwise, that is something to consider when you don't have many options...I'm not saying capsules are bad at all! Again, I think there are tons of reasons why people like them. But it was something that came up that I was like, oh yeah, that's another factor that involves some amount of privilege (because it does require time or space in a way that having 25+ shirts can give you wiggle room with...) Pros and cons to both...
text:I have an in home washer (and a dryer and drying racks and a clothes line. I have enough work clothes (plus socks and undies) that I can go at least two weeks without doing laundry. That is more important to me than having a minimalist wardrobe.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Women who have revamped your entire wardrobe — how did that go? What is your advice for the rest of us?	labels:I've done so twice and the first time was a disaster.   I was trying to combine advice about "classic and timeless" pieces with a look based around an entirely different aesthetic, and it turned into a mess. I was still holding onto outdated assumptions about what was fashionable. I was trying to do too much at once. I have almost no pieces left from that year.  I am convinced that for 99% of people, "classic and timeless" is a scam. If you sew your own Victorian-style pieces, that's awesome. If you have a lot of time and money to spend a lot of time looking for the perfect 100% silk and cashmere pieces from different decades, that's awesome too. Otherwise, there's a good chance that you're in denial about a dated wardrobe. A better goal for most people is to get to a place where you can update with new pieces slowly - maybe 2-3 per year. I will be buying one new wool sweater this winter.  A good place to start is with what you already gravitate to in your daily life and your own closet. Imagine that you really want to go to work (or your favorite restaurant or to do something fun on the weekend, whatever you do often) tomorrow wearing something that makes you feel special and look your best, but you're going to be wearing it all day, so it needs to be pretty comfortable. Which outfit do you pull out?   In my own wardrobe, I can look through the outfits I passed by and say why - too casual (although sometimes those are perfect for another activity), I just don't love it and it would never be my first pick, too tight, too cheap-looking, not my style, too boring. It's easier to build around what you already like than to throw everything away and try to buy things based on an imaginary person that you've never actually been. Get rid of the things that you never gravitate toward, and see what's left. From there, you might need just a few more wish-list pieces to get that smaller wardrobe you love.	episode_done:True
text:Women who have revamped your entire wardrobe — how did that go? What is your advice for the rest of us?	labels:My advice to my past self would be:  GO SLOW. However slowly you think you’re going, it’s still too fast. Find one piece that you really love- beautiful color, perfect fit, quality material, in a style you like- before even thinking about more.  Trying to plan an entire wardrobe (even a tiny one) and then trying to shop for the plan, just landed me with a bunch of stuff that wasn’t quite right. Going slowly, piece by piece, helps to make sure I’m making a good purchase rather than something rushed, trying to fill a perceived wardrobe hole. It’s also helpful, because if you go slowly one piece by one piece, you’ll also be doing “with as few pieces as possible”, and can stop when you have what you need and love.  My second point of advice to myself would be to stay off the internet, focus on what I actually like for myself, and not get distracted by all the pretty things on all the different people.	episode_done:True
text:Women who have revamped your entire wardrobe — how did that go? What is your advice for the rest of us?	labels:If you aren't married to the idea of capsules:  Buy seasonally appropriate basics and rent fancier work clothing or special occasion garments from Rent the Runway (or another rental brand). It's a good way to take your time with building a wardrobe you like while trying out trends you may be curious about but hesitant to pull the trigger on. It's worth noting that your wardrobe is never really done. Things get worn out, fall out of favor, stop fitting your lifestyle, or you just stop liking them. I think if you have a solid foundation (jeans, slacks, a few blouses, sweaters, t-shirts, undergarments, a few pairs of black and brown shoes) you can find flexibility with styling beyond that without feeling that you have not enough clothing or a million things and nothing to wear.	episode_done:True
text:Women who have revamped your entire wardrobe — how did that go? What is your advice for the rest of us?	labels:There's often a difference between clothes that you like/admire vs what you actually enjoy wearing/works for your everyday life.  Being able to clearly define the latter usually eliminates a lot of stuff from consideration.	episode_done:True
text:Women who have revamped your entire wardrobe — how did that go? What is your advice for the rest of us?	labels:When you're looking at pictures for inspiration ask yourself if you like the clothes or if you like what you feel the clothes etc represent. If you buy clothes because of what you feel they represent you may end up wasting money and having to do another wardrobe re-vamp.  To give you an example: I find myself drawn to drapey, flowy, bohemian, artsy types of clothes. The sort that tend to look good on taller women with small busts. Now I'm a firm believer in wearing things you like regardless of whether conventional wisdom says they look "good" on you. But in this case what I was being drawn to was the lifestyle I felt those clothes represented, not the clothes themselves - which it turned out did not fit my lifestyle, my personality or my shape. It took quite a few expensive mistakes to realise this.	episode_done:True
text:Women who have revamped your entire wardrobe — how did that go? What is your advice for the rest of us?	labels:I had to revamp my wardrobe over the last two years as I changed jobs and sizes.   I had just finished a no-buy year, while I lost weight so was starting with nothing at all.   1. Buy decent undergarments. As a large busted woman, I can’t tell how anything fits without a good fitting bra. There’s r/abrathatfits to get a good measurement as many women are wearing the wrong bras. I got a size and sister size from this, went to a bra shop with a good range of bras and tried a few on to find one everyday one that fitted perfectly. Get a decent sports bra while you are there if you exercise at any speed above a gentle stroll.   2. Know what you need for where. Having items for work, weekend and exercise is important. Some people don’t separate work and weekend wear that much and others have wardrobes that look like they belong to different people.   3. Start with one or two items/outfits (especially if trying a new look) before committing. There’s no point in buying a whole wardrobe that later doesn’t feel right. I had a strong sense of what I liked and still bought a couple of oopsies.   4. A classic/go-to item might not be a classic for you. I love the look of skirts but never ever wear them. I only wear trousers and/or dresses so wasted my money on a couple of classic black skirts for work. I have worn them exactly 0 times.   5. Take risks in the dressing room. Try different colours and silhouettes on in actual shops and think about what you like/don’t like about each piece. I have changed my style a bit as it is free to try it on!   5. A decent blazer that fits well makes any outfit more formal when you need it- even us more casual people.	episode_done:True
text:How do you actually incorporate colour in your wardrobe?	labels:You're kinda making a mountain out of a molehill here. It's not hard to wear colors. Relax about it. It's not a disaster if things clash slightly. You'll be fine. There are no fashion police.   My usual style is I get either brightly colored top or a bright bottom (or a bright dress). The other is relatively neutral to avoid clashing or being overwhelming. This is not a hard and fast rule. There are times when it's fine to break it. It's just a guideline for when I'm in a hurry.  Match saturation and brightness. Burgundy and plum are fine together because both are relatively saturated and dark. Pale pink and lavender work together. Burgundy and lavender are harder because they don't match in saturation and brightness. They aren't impossible to put together and look good but it's a bit harder.  You will not look good in some colors. This is 100% fine. Try things on. Figure out what makes you look awful. You can do this. It doesn't need any special knowledge.
text:In total agreement with this. I kept trying to find my season/palette/whatever using a bunch of systems and always got frustrated. But then I found friskygatos on IG and she was just like... "Hold up colors next to each other and if you like them together, wear it." And her lizard brain concept was super freeing.  Today I wore an all pale pink outfit and got tons of compliments and felt fabulous. I don't even know/care if it was my most flattering color, but just the fact that I looked different than the sea of neutral outfits out there made me happy!	labels:> "Hold up colors next to each other and if you like them together, wear it."  That is literally how I choose outfits and I've been told I look well-put together.	episode_done:True
text:How do you actually incorporate colour in your wardrobe?	labels:I think an important question you should ask yourself before just trying to incorporate color is  are you actually dissatisfied with neutrals/does color really inspire you? I think the biggest reason I wear color is because when I look at it, it makes me happy, it inspires me to want to wear pieces, and I get excited shopping for it.   In looking for color to incorporate in with your neutrals, I would just first find out what colors you feel drawn to - sure maybe some you’ll find will be things you like, but maybe aren’t the most “flattering” or versatile, but I still think that’s a good place to start, because fashion should be fun.   As far as practical advice, wearing color is a lot easier when you have neutrals to pair it with. I tend to wear one bright color/color family with neutral tones and tie it in also with my accessories. Things like earrings or accessories can be good places to introduce color if you are feeling nervous about it as well.  Also, learning about the color wheel and the undertones of colors can be really useful for color matching.	episode_done:True
text:How do you actually incorporate colour in your wardrobe?	labels:This sounds counterintuative, but you should try colourful patterns. Than, you take one of the colours from the pattern and wear another item of thar color. For axample, I have a top with  white, orange, blue and olive stripes, and I can easily pair it with any bottoms in these colours.	episode_done:True
text:How do you actually incorporate colour in your wardrobe?	labels:Assuming you wear jeans and a t shirt now and then, go out and buy a cheap t shirt or two in a colour you like. If you find yourself wearing them regularly, buy some more bright items. If you don't wear them much, then perhaps bright colours are not for you, at least now, and you won't have spent much to find out.	episode_done:True
text:How do you actually incorporate colour in your wardrobe?	labels:Start with colors that go with your existing colors. Navy goes really well with mustard yellow. Mustard yellow goes with black and white effortlessly.   Once you have that down, then choose colors that go with the colors you added. So, if you added mustard, than, brown goes with mustard. Viridian goes with mustard. Pink goes with mustard. So on and so forth. Some colors will look good on you, and some won’t, so, the best way to incorporate colors is to just try colors on.
text:I love mustard as a neutral!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do you actually incorporate colour in your wardrobe?	labels:As someone who used to exclusively wear black (not exaggerating, it was a manifestation an anxiety/ocd problem- lots of therapy, baby steps, and now I consider leopard and hot pink neutrals), I found it easiest to start with accessories (especially shoes!) and patterns that were mostly black. Dark florals go with just about everything. Once I got used to that, I branched out into floral pants and funky sweaters. There was definitely trial and error, and I spent a ton of money on items that ultimately went to consignment it goodwill. However, now I have a really good idea of what I like, and while I still love a good neutral moment, my wardrobe is probably 1/2 colorful pieces, 1/4 non-black neutrals, and 1/4 black pieces.	episode_done:True
text:How do you actually incorporate colour in your wardrobe?	labels:Don’t over think it. Just rip off the band aid. Head to a store that has basic tops (sweaters or t-shirts depending on your location) and pick a colour that makes you smile. Bring it home, try it on with all your bottoms til you find a good combo - given your focus on basics, there will be more than one!  Uniqlo is good for this, also banana republic usually has a table of sweaters with a few “this season” brights (last year I got an amazing Kelly green sweater there - works so well with navy!)	episode_done:True
text:How do you actually incorporate colour in your wardrobe?	labels:Colorful skirts are good options to try out. I also have a mostly neutral wardrobe, but I discovered that I can pair basic white shirts with a more colorful skirt.  It looks fun, but still "safe" because I don't have to worry about what color suits my skin tone.	episode_done:True
text:How do you actually incorporate colour in your wardrobe?	labels:To add onto the rest of the great advice in this thread, following the color trends can be helpful in seeing how color looks on others and how you can apply them to yourself. I follow some accounts that specifically photograph folks during fashion week in various locales, and there's so much vibrancy that occurs there with colors that you might not expect to fit together. It helps to have these (kind of) practical examples in mind before you go on blowing money on colorful goods.  I've never actually done a color analysis, personally, but intuitively over time you will get a sense for what flatters you. You can even try holding random household items like Clorox wipes (lol) or notebooks up to your face or skin to see if that color would work as an actual item on you, preferably in good natural lighting where it won't distort the tones so much. I also like to accessorize with one small bright thing at a time, like bags, belts, scarves, or jewelry. Another way to do this is with wearing nail polish, either different colors on your nails all at once or specific parts of a palette to see if that combination is flattering with your skin tone.	episode_done:True
text:How do you actually incorporate colour in your wardrobe?	labels:I hopped on r/coloranalysis and got an idea of my palette. I’ve been able to add a few sweaters/tops into my rotation that I feel confident look good against my skin tone. It has definitely helped me dip my toes into wearing more color and feeling confident doing so! Before I had an idea of what colors actually worked, I felt uncomfortable buying/wearing color.  I didn’t really think adding an accessory in a color helped me feel more comfortable. Understanding color theory a little more wrt how it works on my own coloring felt more intentional in my opinion, then I just went for adding a few tops.	episode_done:True

I mostly thrift but also look on used slow fashion instagram, Etsy, Poshmark, etc.  For thrifting, there is no secret - just go often, don't feel any pressure to buy something every time you go.   2.  Only buy natural fibres (silk, wool, cotton, linen) - this isn't hard and fast as I have thrifted down puffer jackets, etc but if it is touching my skin it isn't acrylic or polyester.  3.  Buy things that are interesting.  A unique shape or colour, or a beautiful material, it stands out on the rack. I mostly don't thrift fast fashion, it was shit to begin with - I am looking for vintage tags and high quality clothing.  Look at how the seams are finished, how the buttons are sewn on.	episode_done:True
text:How to build a style with a limited outlet?	labels:You're asking a couple of different questions  1) how do I build a style without much time or money?  Pinterest is a good way to do that.  Everytime you do have time and see a look you like pin it.  Pin whatever pleases you visually.  Can be other things besides fashion too.  Then when you have a bunch of things pinned look for a common thread.  Maybe it will turn out that you're a person who never knew she loved organic, flowing shapes in blues or graphic designs and structured fabrics.    2) figure out how well what you like goes with your body type or coloring and if there are ways to bring the two together.  I have a big butt so I may be able to wear some of the things i like and not others.  I also look like crap in orange but can get away with coral so I'd go for coral instead or tiny bits of orange print on a background of a color that does flatter me.  3) Yes there are staples that are classic.  black or navy or gray or for some people brown pants however if you're not a black or navy or gray or brown person you might be better off figuring out what you like first and then what would be a staple for you.	episode_done:True
text:How to build a style with a limited outlet?	labels:The most important part of expanding my closet as a college student with limited resources was  changing my mindset from always wanting brand-new clothes to appreciating thrift shopping. It's just so much cheaper and most of the clothes are in perfect condition. In addition, the vast amount of different styles from even different decades makes it much more fun to shop at.  Jeans are my absolute favorites to thrift. The wear (and tear) makes them so much more unique!
text:I agree with this mindset wholeheartedly. Fashion is an incredibly expensive hobby for me, personally, and I let it be because I can afford it now, but you can absolutely build a wardrobe off of thrifting and purchasing secondhand clothes. And in fact, once your mindset shifts to this, or even to concepts like capsule wardrobes, you'll force your mind into building more styling options with what you have, even if it's not the vast wardrobe that you might see from influencers or bloggers.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How to build a style with a limited outlet?	labels:Where are you from? Are you a student or a working adult? What is your budget and purpose of dressing up? Do you have any spare weekend to go into a megastore (e.g. Zara, your local department store...) to try out all types of colors and silhouettes to see what suits you? You're not obligated to buy even if you try it on. If anyone ask, just say you're just trying out and still thinking about it.             I suggest knowing your measurements (use a measuring tape!) and sticking to a capsule wardrobe. Black/White top + colorful bottom or colorful top + black/white/brown bottom with neutral shoes.       Keep in mind the stylish people on social media spend a ton on their clothes or rent/return them after taking photos so they are not exactly appropriate comparisons for everyone.	episode_done:True
text:How to build a style with a limited outlet?	labels:I would start with good quality basics. Having a good foundation will allow you to expand with more trendy or style defining pieces, but it’s very hard to achieve a personal style without the first step. Unfortunately it does take time to find the right pieces, but I would suggest watching fashion YouTubers as a resource so you can see people try on clothes and get a better sense of the fit or quality.	episode_done:True
text:How to build a style with a limited outlet?	labels:I almost exclusively online shop. I wouldn't say that I am a trend setter or anything, but it is so much easier to look at photos online of people who have the same body shape as me whose fashion I admire, compare those photos to what I have in my closet, and purchase what is missing to make the outfit work all in one place. It sounds like a lot, but I find this so much easier, less anxiety-inducing, and less time consuming than brick-and-mortar shopping. Plus, usually returns are just a drop off somewhere with a digital reciept rather than waiting is line at a customer service counter with a paper receipt that I have lost twice, ripped, and had to tape back together. A little tidbit: the biggest trick to online shopping is to KNOW YOUR MEASUREMENTS!!! A cheap measuring tape works wonders.	episode_done:True
text:How to build a style with a limited outlet?	labels:Volume (a lot of items) and access (lots of designer things) doesn't create personal style. Personal style creates personal style, and it is a huge spectrum of things. There is no "one up" in personal style when it is authentic and your own. You'd simply appreciate all the style around you as its own, and appreciate and focus on your own style and look. Most people on social media have tacky, pointless style. They're wearing clothing, etc. for likes and clicks. The problem with this is that it means you're always cycling through what generates likes and clicks - not what is unique and stylish about you. You don't need new clothes. You don't need to change. You need to recognize your style and own it, and find the validation in it how it comes versus mirroring/measuring it to someone who is operating for validation and attention.	episode_done:True
text:How to build a style with a limited outlet?	labels:I've went through this myself, and the thing that has helped the most is to build that skill inside your head of "what does style mean to me?" The answer to this question is different for everyone, and you'll see it reflected just on the WAYWT threads - whether fashion is highlighting your existence in a certain social sphere, whether style is function over form, etc. What I did before my "outlet" grew was to source my inspiration online and think about pieces that I had and why I did or didn't like or wear them. You can do this with your existing wardrobe, or by window-shopping, which I know isn't so easy in COVID times, but you can do it online as well. What features do you love about your existing clothes? What defines "nice clothes" to yourself? I used to think that it was all about polished business casual clothing, because that reflected the work environments I had to survive in. Your staples will also be defined by what you think flatters (or unflatters!) you the most.  To be honest, I think style takes time; time to hone in on what you want or how you want to represent yourself. And if it doesn't take time, it does take money, and that's why being a stylist is a viable career path as well. But you do not need money to build or learn about style. My style has changed vastly from when I moved cross-country multiple times, and when I've changed careers. But style doesn't need to be static or done immediately. :)	episode_done:True

It made me look at things in a more runway mindset, "Why is this outfit interesting?"  I have a request, if you're taking requests (no pressure though, this was great)  a summer album? I feel like in the summer my style is more constricted or more basic because I wear fewer pieces, and it's easier for me to have weird & cool proportions with jackets and sweaters.	episode_done:True

text:Favorite everyday-fashion magazines	labels:I’m 29, and to be honest I don’t know of any fashion magazines besides Vogue, and like you, that is just not my lifestyle. Other magazines seem to target older women. It doesn’t seem like there is an equivalent of Seventeen or Teen Vogue for us, which is a shame. I spent ALL my allowance money at the magazine stand as a young girl, I really miss those days!    Now I honestly rely on blogs like Who What Wear.

She flaunted its (supposedly) high price and honestly, it was hilarious lol.  The thing is, both my bff and I are massively into bags, yet MV was virtually unknown back then... and we are both Italian.  Since the lawsuit in 2017, MV has gained momentum in cheap/mid-range Italian stores like crazy, which I think really boils down to people making a connection between the brands.	episode_done:True

I find it interesting trying to break out what she wears when she's not playing a character and what she wears when she's trying play a character or when she's not trying but still is being manipulative. (**POSSIBLE SPOILERS UP TO END OF S3: DON'T READ AHEAD IF YOU HAVEN'T WATCHED AND DON'T WANT TO BE SPOILED ALSO IF SOMEONE KNOWS HOW TO BLOCK THEM OUT AND CAN LET ME KNOW THAT'D BE AWESOME)**  &#x200B;  The little girlish dress with the cut out heart when she's pleading with her mom to form some kind of relationship with her and the pink dress when she's trying to trick Konstantin into thinking she's worried about him so she can steal the card with the next job on it.  When she's feeling herself and doesn't have to play a character she's usually wearing a patterned suit or some comfy black pants and a cool top. When she was playing Billie she wore two kimono-inspired jackets, which is pretty interesting and I just noticed the continuity for that character. When she was starting over after she thought Eve was dead she's wearing stylish romantic dresses which match her new villa in a way.    &#x200B;  **END OF POSSIBLE SPOILERS**  &#x200B;  Anyway I enjoyed the album, she has a really interesting style and wears everything so well.	episode_done:True

text:Ladies with eczema or sensitive skin, what kind of leisure wear, tights, and leggings do you buy?	labels:All my non athletic leggings are from American Eagle. It’s been a few years since I purchased some from there since I don’t currently need any (plus they all all seem to be high-waisted nowadays) so I don’t know if the fabric makeup is the same or not, but I’d give them a try. I also like some of their joggers. In case you need any athletic leggings, Under Armor has been comfortable for me. Just the basic cold gear or heat gear though. The higher rated ones (2.0 and up) have a thicker inner layer which I did not care for on my skin. Too much of a “snag and drag” type sensation if I had any dryer patches of skin.	episode_done:True

text:Ladies with eczema or sensitive skin, what kind of leisure wear, tights, and leggings do you buy?	labels:They are expensive, but for wearing under skirts/dresses, I find that silk or a silk/cashmere stocking blend works best for me.

I also found that going on an anti-inflammatory diet helps quite a bit, and using unscented everything and being very careful with my laundry soaps. I use wool drier balls, and am in love with those, too, in place of any softener. I generally sleep without clothing/underwear, unless I am staying at my parents or in-laws, in which case I opt for a fairly modest silk nightgown. At home, I wear 100% cotton leggings or a dress for leisure wear.	episode_done:True
text:Ladies with eczema or sensitive skin, what kind of leisure wear, tights, and leggings do you buy?	labels:I've found that cotton is best, with up to 5% spandex. It's not a sexy look, but cotton flannel pyjamas are very comfy and cause no skin issues for me. I also have a couple pairs of cotton-stretch joggers from Amazon for home wear, and a pair of truly ancient 100% viscose leggings (they're basically see through now, which is probably why they're so soft). Honestly I usually wear a cotton dress around the house though - I find anything tight-fitting on the legs can cause trouble.  For tights, Falke has always been more comfortable than average for me. I buy a size up, which seems to reduce the pressure and itching.	episode_done:True
text:Ladies with eczema or sensitive skin, what kind of leisure wear, tights, and leggings do you buy?	labels:I always found tights and leggings to be itchy until I tried the Vuori Performance Jogger. They aren't skin-tight and are incredibly soft. My skin can't handle fleece, regular sweatpant material, or anything remotely scratchy. The vuori joggers are my new favorite pant - I have multiple black pairs and can't sing their praises enough.	episode_done:True
text:Ladies with eczema or sensitive skin, what kind of leisure wear, tights, and leggings do you buy?	labels:OP, my boyfriend's mother was tested allergic to blue dye in polyester and nylon, so she can only wear natural fibers. You should probably get it checked if those fibers are bothering you. Maybe you have an allergy with some chemicals used to dye or process these fibers. The allergist will help you figure out the category of clothes you can and cannot wear.  In my bf's mom's case, she only wears 100% cotton, wool, cashmere, and silk fibers.	episode_done:True
text:What I Like is Not What I choose to wear	labels:What I like to look at and what I like to wear are not the same thing. I actually think a lot of fashion struggles come from people not understanding how to separate what they find aesthetically interesting from what meets the specific needs in their life.  When you look at a photo of an outfit, you're not *just* reacting to the outfit itself. You're also reacting to the body of the model, the styling choices (makeup and hair), and the photography decisions (the pose, the location, the lighting).   I might look at a photo and think "that person looks so cool in that outfit," but that person isn't me. I would not look that cool in that outfit because I'm a completely different person.  When I choose clothing for myself it needs to satisfy my aesthetic tastes when paired with my body and the amount of effort I'm willing to put into styling (i.e. zero), as well as suit the needs for my daily life. That's actually a limited number of options for me.   But when I am admiring an outfit or a photo, I'm not constrained by my hang ups about my body or the needs of my daily life. I can just like the outfit without having to contextualize it around myself, which is actually quite nice.  So, personally speaking, my interest in fashion isn't limited to clothing I would choose to wear. I find it's much more freeing to allow myself to enjoy fashion and outfits without always questioning whether I would like the outfit on my own body.
text:This makes a lot of sense about the life you lead vs what you like to look at. I really like looking at crisp, clean looks, but right now I’m home with a baby, and when I’m working I’m a teacher who needs comfortable clothes to move around in and that can be washed easily. I also hate to iron. Crisp white button downs and heels aren’t going to cut it.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:I love this answer, and I think that’s also why certain looks on certain people end up looking so costume-y. If a look is not authentic to your life and to who you are, it’s not going to have the effect you’re hoping to achieve.  The notion of appreciating fashion without feeling compelled to wear it yourself also ties into the conversations around cultural appropriation. As beautiful as I find traditional attire from other countries and cultures, or as cool as the fashion is in many countercultures, I don’t NEED to wear those outfits on my own body to appreciate and enjoy them.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:I love this comment. It’s so freeing to appreciate fashion (and fashion photography) as an art and not only from a consumer perspective or through the lens of your own wardrobe needs. I have tons of Pinterest boards for aesthetics that are totally impractical for me, but I just enjoy looking at them and imagining the lifestyle of those characters. I only have a couple of boards that are for items I would practically wear. Those boards have purpose too, but I have a definite mental distinction between looking at outfits for fun and trying to fill holes in my wardrobe.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:This is a Good Comment.  Especially the part about reacting to the model's body and styling as well as the items of clothing. And man, it can be real tough to come to terms with that sometimes. Having a cohesive style certainly helps with the styling aspect in these situations, but the part about the body is rife with stress and emotion for a lot of people. There's no one right way to deal with that. Everyone just needs to find the line between what they like and what they actually want.	labels:	episode_done:True

I’m plus sized, can’t walk in any heeled shoe to save my life, and wince at spending more than $40 on a pair of pants. What do I like? Effortless, Aritzia type, skinny jeans and blanket scarf looks paired with healed boots that are styled on straight sized models whose socks cost more than my whole outfit 😂.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Well-said! Body type especially has a big impact on how an outfit/style is perceived. Models showing off androgynous styles rarely have curvy body types. Meanwhile, "sexy" looks often go hand-in-hand with curvy. And the "off-duty model" look pretty much requires already looking like a model, otherwise you're just a chick in casual clothes. A beautiful woman looks good in damn near anything, that's why most models are beautiful women, lol.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Exactly. It’s the fantasy life that those images convey. When I see someone wearing crisp trousers, soft button ups, stilettos, etc., I imagine that I’m living the life of someone wearing them. Effortless, breezy, maybe wandering around Paris window shopping on a nice spring day... but in reality I’m working from home on my couch. Structured trousers would be uncomfortable AF, cotton/linen blouses would be a wrinkly mess, my cat would get fur everywhere, I’m allergic to wool and I don’t wear shoes in my house, because ew. Or I’m going for a walk in my neighbourhood after work and it’s raining and dark, so I need a waterproof/reflective jacket and sturdy boots. It’s fun to look at pictures of nice styles, but they aren’t my reality.	labels:Ironically, right before the pandemic I was looking at buying a new suit, as I was just months into a new job that required me to be a bit more "business" (at least on 5 or so days a year) than my previous "distracted-professor" type jobs. I'm now glad I hadn't bit the bullet yet.   I just bought a new pair of jeans, as I was wearing out my previous pair. The ones that came are a little too big (despite being the same numerical size, style, *and color* as my last pair...), but maybe that's ok right now?	episode_done:True

text:Omg you’re so spot on, this is exactly how I feel. I often forget to look at the styling choices that create the whole look - such as the hair, the pose, the setting. I’m like “wow she looks amazing and effortless and so so cool” and perhaps that doesn’t have to 100% do with just the clothes, but perhaps the way her arm is draped over a chair, or a pose where the legs are spread lazily apart in a pair of wide leg jeans.	labels:[INVALID]	episode_done:True

text:Totally agreed, and this is why it makes me a bit squirmy when people say "wear what makes you happy!" in this sub, in the sense that it should be the last word in clothing. Yes, of course you should wear what makes you happy, but what makes us happy to wear is not so simple for a lot of people.  There are tons of things I don't particularly love in isolation but make me happy on my body, and conversely things I love in isolation but *don't* love on my body, and that can come from many angles: pure aesthetics but also fit, comfort, personal goals, how I'm treated when I'm wearing it, etc etc. What exact elements contribute to any of these is really the crux of personal fashion, and it's a far more complex conversation than just "wear it if you like it".	labels:Yeah, "wear what you like!" is an unhelpful platitude.

text:Yeah, I will be posting on insta, maybe Facebook (land of in-laws) depending on how sexy the Edie Britt (Desperate Housewives) and Shane McCutchen outfits turn out. I added the social media part moreso so people could try for themselves, because I do keep my social media private. However, I really do think you need to have some kind of goal other than "I'm going to try and dress like Blair Waldorf" to make it fun and keep momentum going.   I suppose I could post outfits here with my face blurred if anything comes together particularly well! However, because I'm not buying any new clothes, not all of the references are as spot on as they could be. As such, I'm nervous people would be disappointed!	labels:No, the not buying new clothes makes it so much more interesting! Buying the cloth is something everyone could have done.

text:It is very fun! I think to myself, "what would this character do with my closet?" so even though I don't have the low-rise jeans and tight satin tops of the 2000s needed to make more exact replicas, I still have a sense of what colors, fabrics, and silhouettes the character would go for. I am also fairly curvy, with prominent dark curly hair, so have to make adjustments there as well. For example, most of what Gabrielle Solis (Desperate Housewives) wears looks much less "classy" on a curvier frame, so to get her "vibe" I have to pick different pieces to fit my body type.	labels:[INVALID]	episode_done:True

The reason is, you definitely get climatized, where what would consider "warm" in the winter to you now will feel chilly enough to wear heavyweight items you hadn't expected would work once you are climatized. A lot of items that you think will/won't work end up being the opposite, etc. You mentioned having less storage, so it sounds like you will need to offload/purge at some point, but I'd wait to do it once you get there and put it off for as long as you can to truly see what items work. I'll never move to a cold climate again but even moving to different warmer climates, I will wait to do any paring down/purging until I can get a little climatized and adapt.

text:How did you curate/purge your wardrobe specifically for moving? What pieces did you bring when moving to a drastically different climate? What other fashion moving tips do people have?	labels:Most of my moves have been apartment-to-apartment in the same climate (four distinct seasons with extremes in temperatures in both directions), but I still like to use the time spent packing as an opportunity to reevaluate/purge. Generally I look at fit, condition/quality, and whether or not pieces fit with my lifestyle (e.g. if you work in a formal office you might need more formal clothes and less casual ones, and the reverse is also true).  It's also a good excuse to get rid of clothes you keep out of guilt (e.g. things you don't wear often but were a gift or that you feel bad getting rid of) so you only move things you love and are excited by.   When thinking about climate, you might not need a ton of warm sweaters, but you may still want to keep things like cardigans or lightweight sweaters for air-conditioned buildings. I live somewhere with hot summers, but I still always keep an "office sweater" at my desk because people can be a little overzealous with the AC. Yes, it might be 97 degrees F outside, but when you step inside to a 68 F building, it can be a bit of a shock. Bonus points if you own a top layer that's thin enough to ball up and put in your purse. I love breezy kimono-style layers as a hot weather third piece, but jewelry/accessories also gain more importance when trying to feel put together.  In general, try to think of your clothes in categories, and if there are categories you don't think you'll wear as often, keep fewer pieces in those categories. Also think about what things you may want to keep but store (maybe in an under-the-bed box?) for rare occasions. For example, I hate shorts and almost never wear them, but I do have a couple pairs that I keep for camping trips so that I don't need to rebuy on those occasions. Will you need warm clothes for visits to family/friends in colder climates, and if so, what quanitity?	episode_done:True
text:How did you curate/purge your wardrobe specifically for moving? What pieces did you bring when moving to a drastically different climate? What other fashion moving tips do people have?	labels:When I moved from a very hot climate to a super cold, snowy one I was in a weird place both financially and with my wardrobe. It was supposed to be extremely short term but ended up being long term/possibly permanent, which definitely messed with my expectations for my wardrobe.  Eventually I got rid of all my "warm weather" clothes for various reasons, mostly size/style ones, and when I was able to started to stock up on winter wear. I didn't know what I liked so I just kind of went for it. For example, I thrifted tons of scarves only to barely use them a couple years later because I realized I only like infinity scarves. The same thing happened with multiple categories because I was so desperate to fill the missing chunk of my wardrobe.  I agree with the advice to wait as long as possible before making drastic changes. Its hard to know what you'll actually end of needing, much less what you'll like or enjoy using. See what you can pick up secondhand to try out styles that suit your new climate best before investing a lot of money or time into altering your wardrobe.	episode_done:True

text:Was coming here to say this as well. I recently moved from the Midwest to Florida and my body adjusted pretty quickly to the higher temps here. It’s my first winter and I find myself still wearing my warmest wool and cashmere sweaters, winter coat, and gloves. It’s all relative, so a 30F degree drop day to day is going to feel cold regardless of if you started at 90F or 60F. I would also recommend trying to wait a year if you can before purging. I think I could safely purge my snow pants if I wasn’t planning on using them when I visit my parents. It’s also hotter longer here though, so I could definitely reduce my sweaters by 20% (the ones I reach for last anyway) to make room for more hot weather clothing. Hope this helps and good luck with your move!	labels:In regards to the snow pants: I personally would definitely find a way to store stuff like that if you like to travel or visit family. I have always lived in southeastern Texas but my husband and I tend to be able to travel when it is winter up north and I *definitely* have super cold weather (for me) items I only break out when I travel. Even though they only get used once a year or less, it is worth it to have for me.	episode_done:True
text:How did you curate/purge your wardrobe specifically for moving? What pieces did you bring when moving to a drastically different climate? What other fashion moving tips do people have?	labels:I live in a small space so I try to make my pieces wearable throughout the year. I always wear a cami, jeans/shorts, and ankle boots. My open knit cardigan works all year round. You really have to be realistic and ask if you’re going to wear it in the next couple of years and how you’re going to store it. I would get rid of things that you could easily replace and polyester/polyamide (because it’s not as breathable and caused me bacne).   For the third piece, consider accessories. Belts, necklaces, bracelets, scarves, bags, hats, and earrings can add interest to your outfit.	episode_done:True

Thusfar they've had some of the mildest winters in years and NOW I am moving again to England where I have been told the weather is basically the same as Seattle. I definitely second what others have said about waiting until you need something to purchase.

text:I dyed my leather boots and here is how it went.	labels:I have dyed a leatherwallet from Fossil before! Left the leather wallet in a soaked shopping bag and forgot about it. By the time I finally took it out , the soft brown leather had a big wet stains all over it which could not be fixed. I couldn’t bring myself to throw it away because it’s a gift from my mom, so I decided to dye it black. It’s been 2 years since the dye job, and the dye has held up really well (might upload the current pic if enough people are interested). I’ve also helped friends refresh their leather wallets/accessories/furniture using black leather dye, all with good results.  Every time I see people saying that their dye job has chipped/faded (I remember a few youtubers trying to dye their beige Chanel bagsblack), it’s likely because one of the following three reasons:   1) the new dye was not treated with a sealant.  2) the coating/sealant from original piece was not completely stripped, or had oils/waxes (from hand/leather care products) remaining on the surface preventing the dye from sticking. 3) the material is not leather, but polyurethane.  Applying sealant is absolutely crucial for longevity IMO. r/leathercraft has helped me so much!  Beautiful work OP!	episode_done:True

text:I dyed my leather boots and here is how it went.	labels:I used to work for an airline that required navy shoes as part of the uniform, but navy dress shoes are harder to come by so a lot of us would dye black shoes navy (one person would buy dye then pass it around to others). I once bought a pair of tan shoes and dyed them navy, but then scuffs would show tan! The dye I used was not as strong I suppose, or I was not stripping them adequately.	episode_done:True

text:If you’re not yet ready to commit to investing in an expensive good quality winter coat (long ones are indeed more expensive!) before you get to feel out conditions for your new climate—an intermediate solution I recommend is that you wear a light/thinner puffer & a waterproof rain coat over it. Your puffer will keep you warm (and you can wear it solo on clear days) and the raincoat will give you snow/wind protection. They will also trap heat and warm the *air* surrounding your body, which is key!  Costco base layers are also wonderful quality and super affordable (and I think you can get them delivered online). I wore them on a pre-pan trip to Iceland during NOVEMBER and I would have to like race to rip them off when we got indoors because I would begin literally sweating lol but so warm when outside!	labels:Even a fleece and a raincoat will keep you warm.

text:what pieces/brands did you buy when moving from a warmer climate to a cooler climate? what did you end up regretting/not using?	labels:Many years ago I moved from Hawaii to college in the Northeast. I would recommend 1) Buying it all there, because they'll have what's good for their climate and 2) starting out with cheaper options (thrifted, Old Navy, Target range) even if it's not quite your style. Don't spend much time, effort, and money until you see how you really feel after at least a year of seasons. Maybe you want warmer stuff than you thought you would, or realize you should invest in nicer socks, or discover you don't actually like turtlenecks, or shift to a different style when you're surrounded by a new area's vibe. Let yourself experience it for a bit without pressuring yourself to do it all right.

text:Yes! I love uniqlo's' merino wool sweaters for an inexpensive, nice wool sweater. They will shrink a bit though so watch out.

text:Depending on where you move to, there may be local thrift stores in your area that carry high quality second hand coats for significantly less than full price.  I think most of my favorite winter gear has come from second hand stores, including multiple winter coats, fleece and wool layering sweaters, heavy duty winter boots, etc.   My favorite cold weather brands to keep an eye out for when I’m thrifting are: - Patagonia (jackets and fleeces) - Sorel (winter boots) - Marmot (jackets and fleeces) ... my current winter coat is a knee-length puffy Marmot - Mountain Hardware (hats and gloves) - REI (fleeces) - The North Face (jackets and fleeces)  Edit: Just because these are my preferred types of items from these brands doesn't mean that their other items aren't worth checking out as well! All of these brands produce solid cold weather gear, and if you're ever in doubt you can google a specific item to see what people are saying about it online.   Also, as u/BeeVoltage pointed out, be cautious about going second hand for your waterproof layer and try to stick to items with tags still on them or that were released recently as waterproofing does wear out over time.	labels:Second this! No such thing as bad weather, just bad clothes.   Make sure to check FABRICS when buying secondhand. Wool, Cashmere, down (not polyester fill) for sweaters, hats and overcoats, cotton, silk, or long underwear made for underclothes. You will want hats, gloves, scarves and good socks, and sturdy shoes. All can be cute and fit any aesthetic.   I moved from southern west coast Canada to interior Canada and learned that layering was my friend. Long underwear camis, cotton tights, jeans, sweaters, usually a ultra thin down with a wool coat overtop, hats, scarves, and gloves. Cover that skin!	episode_done:True

text:Does anyone else have “irony pieces”?	labels:A long time ago, a friend at work told me no one would take me seriously as long as I wore cheapo pantyhose.  I looked down at my crappy nylons and actually felt cheap. I went to Nordtroms that night and bought presentable nylons and wore them to work the next day. She nodded in approvement and then told me no one would take me seriously as long as I wore cheap sweaters. I then bought a wildly pretty ivory cable knit sweater and wore it to work and feeling quite exactly like 1000000 bucks AND i had fancy nylons too. She told me no one would take me seriously with my unkempt shoes and that's when I learned the power of a shoe shining kit.  The next day I wore crappy slacks...and, well you know how the story goes.  To this very day I wear natty clothes and shoes so shiney they can blind fleet of Greek warriors.  The only real irony is no one gave a tootie about nylons and yet I still wear them despite all evidence to the contrary....and she threw al hers away after our company got bought out by another and they were no longer required.

Plus the $$$ designer versions of these. A draped  band collar top in a brocade, and matching loose pants isn't quite black tie but it is formal!   For absolute black tie, I'd say maybe...Donna Karan Urban Zen + major jewelry. something like that. Like a full length avant guarde kaftan in shockingly expensive silk with shibori tie dye or something.  However perfectly fitted vintage clothing + sensitive skin likely isn't happening.   But you can translate aspects of that to your style---like for example you can get a full length ruched parachute silk skirt with granny boots and a draped lace top + a "mourning coat" for a funky "Magnolia Pearl" lagenlook formal style.	episode_done:True

text:Ever been censored at work because of what you wear?	labels:What kids wear isn't really relevant, it's what other teachers wear. I likely wouldn't be allowed to wear a feminist shirt to my work if someone complained even though 99% of my coworkers agree. It is inherently politically - that's the point of it!   I would get them to write down explicitly how they define political. Allowing vague rules allows them to apply it unevenly as it suits them, so get them to **write** it out. Plus, once it's in writing, you have evidence to give to your union rep if they try to hassle you over something not outside of their guidelines.  When I worked at a restaurant with older customers,, I got an upper ear piercing, so I had to wear my hair in a super weird low ponytail that covered the tops of my ears because non-lobe piercings weren't allowed.   I live in a liberal area and though political speech/expression isn't allowed at work because we're government employees, solidarity with marginalized people that doesn't specify a political issue wouldn't be considered polticial. our union literally handed out buttons in solidarity with George Floyd to wear on our work lanyards, and PRIDE/ally stuff is handed our by an employee resource group. As long as it's not saying "defund the police" or "keep gay marriage legal!" or something, then that's not politicial thats at most a social issue	episode_done:True

text:To answer the justification question - cost per wear. My own NF is going on 12 years old now and still looks reasonably new, and I am not (and have not been) particularly kind with it either. I've tossed it around, dragged it on planes, beaches, through Asian wet markets etc. and it's still happily trucking along. The LV Canvas is notoriously hard-wearing.  Along the same line, quality of material used to construct the item. I currently also own leather bags from Everlane and Away. They're both well made, but you can tell the leather is substantially lower in quality, thickness and overall substance than say, my mother's Prada totes with leather that feels really thick and luxurious and plush. And with the Everlane bag, the unfinished suede interior is much rougher than the unfinished suede interiors of say, Celine bags and the leather is much, much thinner.  And while not all designer bags will age well, there is a reason Hermes bags can be handed down through generations but my Everlane bag will probably die before I do.     ETA: LV aside, the aftercare services are also generally pretty amazing. There are brands that will take your bag back and "spa" them for free or nominal fees.

text:To go on a total side-rant here, isn't it nice to be able to carry all this stuff?? I don't carry as much as you but I really like having lip balm, ibuprofen, and kleenex with me at all times. Women often complain about the sexism of pockets (and that's legit) but can we also recognize that it's nice to be able to carry all this handy stuff all the time, which is totally socially acceptable for women and not for men?	labels:Yes, for sure - I’d be lost without half this stuff, and in my opinion, these are such handy items that a lot of people would be hard-pressed to find in an emergency type of situation and would be appreciative to have. Pockets are great, but there are definitely limitations.	episode_done:True
text:What do you carry in your handbag?	labels:The weather is kinda crazy right now. Sprinkle in the mornings. Hot in the day. Cold at night. So my current bag is the Longchamp Neo crossbody. It's my Mary Poppins bag that also keeps my hands free.  I carry my life in my bag six days a week for work. I don't baby my bags and this is easy to dump out and wipe clean.  Inside: I have my small wallet. Essentials punch with neosporin, bandaid, hand sanitizers, extra gloves, extra masks, some meds. Tiger balm, salonpas, hair ties, pads, wipes. A diaper. A beanie with a puff. Tea bags, instant coffee packets, sugar packets, mayo and mustard packets. Soy sauce. Chopsticks, spoons, and forks. Various random snacks. Electrolytes drink mix packets. My makeup bag. A note pad, random pens. Phone charger cord and battery charger. Glasses case...  That's what I see so far. I carry alot.  If I am carrying light. I have a Coach Cassie Crossbody bag that I carry for going out.	episode_done:True
text:What do you carry in your handbag?	labels:Phone (consider the size of your phone if you’re going to utilize dedicated phone pockets on the bag or even just going for a very small bag. Now that I’m thinking about it, I don’t know that my current phone would fit in my WOC), keys, wallet, pill case, eye drops (more so if I’m going to be out for a while; if I’m just running to the store this is not important), extra contact lenses if I’m wearing contacts, sunglasses, lip balm, mask. In more conventional times I’d also sometimes have concealer or lipstick with me for touch ups but now what I carry is pretty minimal. I sometimes have a few other things thrown in there depending on the circumstances but these are my every day items. I carry a specific bag for work since I need to carry my laptop and files for work.   Edit to add: hair ties!	episode_done:True
text:What do you carry in your handbag?	labels:Phone, RFID wallet (smaller size but thick, holds like 15 cards lol), glasses case, keys, 2 small bottles of hand sanitizer, pen, random papers, lip balm. Will add pads/tampons during that time of the month.     Also, two zippered pouches. One has my car registration (street parking in the city where there are a LOT of break ins, so I don't leave anything with my identity on it in the car), and the other has lactaid, tylenol, hair ties and Bobby pins, mints, band aids, oil blotting papers.     Pre-pandemic I also carried face powder and a travel brush and probably up to 4 lipsticks/balms etc. Now am not wearing face makeup or lipstick.	episode_done:True
text:What do you carry in your handbag?	labels:It really depends on what I’m doing and where I’m going, but generally day to day I carry my wallet, keys, reusable shopping bag, pen, lipstick, hand sanitizer, hand lotion, extra mask, perfume, hair ties, a foundation/concealer pen, a book, headphones, tissues, sunglasses, and mints	episode_done:True
text:What do you carry in your handbag?	labels:Back when I had a full time job, a large cross-body bag and inside a wallet (cash, Id, some cards) phone, headphones, charger,sunglasses, water bottle, chapstick, sunscreen, some pens, typically also a book for my commute to work.	episode_done:True
text:What do you carry in your handbag?	labels:There's some variation, but usually:  Phone, keys, wallet, a compact, sunglasses, a pouch with chapstick, Halls, a pen, headphones, and Tylenol, a lipstick or three, a notebook, a book to read, my planner, a phone charger, my keep cup or water bottle (or both), and hand sanitizer and a mask at the moment. Sometimes a travel umbrella.   I manage to fit most of all of that, sometimes with an exclusion or two, in my Fossil Rachel satchel. I love it.	episode_done:True

It's worse where I lived, because even after your soggy pants dried, if it was winter you'd be left with a nice, handsome salt ring from the road salt.

text:How do you guys find your style if you can’t try on clothes due to COVID?	labels:I would say, if there is no need to have new clothes right now (if you stay inside most of the time) wait until you can go out and try things on, especially if you want to try a new style.  If you need to have new clothes now, buy some things you are absolutely sure you like and they will fit, but dont buy too much, don't spend too much money, just in case something goes wrong.
text:This is very true. I’m just trying to figure it out ahead of time so I can save up for my future clothing purchases.  For me, my college program is extremely small (less than 16 people) and given the context of the course, they’re allowing us to go in for face-to-face instruction. I’m hoping that maybe I could exude more style during my limited time out then, but it may not be realistic given the circumstances :)	labels:Well, you can always do your research on what you want to buy, and have your list when you can go and shop!  You can still try and buy things that you know they will fit. Dresses and tops are usually fine, but I wouldn't go for pants or jeans without trying them on because my body is stupid-shaped.   Or you can shop from places you know your size, whatever works for you best.   Just don't try to change your whole wardrobe without trying things on is all I'm saying haha

I’m hoping that maybe I could exude more style during my limited time out then, but it may not be realistic given the circumstances :)	labels:First time here so idk what this sub thinks about dressing according to body type, but I've noticed it works out well for me (i.e. I have a short neck and a round face so I know to not buy any high neck sweaters without trying them on first, so I haven't since covid). That being said, you can look in your closet for what you *really* love/looks good on you and find something similarly cut but in a different pattern/colour. Look online and see what you like; this way you know exactly what you're looking for in store thus limiting your time there.
text:I have been looking at how to dress according to body type! I’ve recently been indulging myself on r/Kibbe. They’ve been extremely helpful in finding what flatters me. So I know what I can wear as far as body type goes and color palette (from r/coloranalysis), I guess it just narrows down to whether I can pull it off the aesthetic without looking weird.	labels:Try Zalando. The return policy is great: you pay only after you decide what you keep/return and shipping is free both ways (at least in Europe). The packages arrive quickly too. You'll find most if not all high street fashion brands there plus a couple of the more expensive ones.	episode_done:True
text:How do you guys find your style if you can’t try on clothes due to COVID?	labels:I’ve been going through my closet and donating/selling everything to clear space for when I can get some new stuff to go with my style changes from 20’s to 30’s. I’m teaching college now, so I really need to change my style so the students stop mistaking me for a student.   I took advantage of Zara’s big end of year sale online and got three amazing new coats that needed replacement in my wardrobe to begin with. I can risk buying tops online because the sizing is usually correct, but for pants, dresses, skirts I’ll have to wait for the case count to go down. I’m in AZ, so like, they don’t really have precautions right now, but I’m limiting my going out to just selling stuff and leaving. Built up some huge store credits!  Edit: right, I’ve been trolling style blogs, insta, and pinterest for months to decide on my new style.	episode_done:True
text:How do you guys find your style if you can’t try on clothes due to COVID?	labels:I think you can still return clothing you buy at the store that you aren’t feeling once you try it on at home! So I would say buy the thing you want to try, try it on at home and if it doesn’t work out just take it back to the store. This might not be the case at every store, but at the stores around me they take returns no problem.	episode_done:True
text:How do you guys find your style if you can’t try on clothes due to COVID?	labels:I’ve been getting really into buying and selling on secondhand apps like depop and poshmark this quarantine! It takes out a lot of the cost concerns cause it’s cheaper than buying new and if I receive the item and I don’t like it, I can just sell it for the same price I bought it for. Plus I’ve cleared up a bunch of closet space by selling my clothes I don’t wear anymore. Done pretty much a complete closet overhaul in the past few months for just a few hundred bucks. Gonna come out of lockdown looking like a whole new person!	episode_done:True
text:How do you guys find your style if you can’t try on clothes due to COVID?	labels:In college, I worked at a dept store.  A good part of my day was cleaning out dressing rooms and I saw some things that I would rather not see (ie human feces, every bodily fluid imaginable).    As a result, I avoid all dressing rooms like Covid.  I'll hold things up in a store, but I won't buy from a place I can't return.	episode_done:True
text:How do you guys find your style if you can’t try on clothes due to COVID?	labels:I feel like before this started I had a good sense of what brands/companies I like and my size in them. I’ve stuck to them rather than trying new brands.	episode_done:True
text:How do you guys find your style if you can’t try on clothes due to COVID?	labels:Little Old Lady here.  Comment on another post called my style "artsy androgynous".  No hand me downs (LOVED them when I was in a position to get!!), but graphic tees/denim shirts/flannels/hoodies/jeans/cargoes.  Never aimed for a style my whole life I don't think, but this is how I ended up, clean, warm/cool, comfortable.	episode_done:True
text:How do you guys find your style if you can’t try on clothes due to COVID?	labels:Amazon has an amazing return policy.

text:Do you: 1) keep all of your wardrobe equally diverse, or 2) keep all of your wardrobe minimal, or 3) keep some pieces relatively similar while diversifying others?	labels:I have a shitload of skirts, plain-colored shirts, and sweaters. Basically I find a thing I like and I get it in every color.  The only thing I don't do that for is pants, because I don't like wearing pants that often, and dresses are their own thing and don't need to be monochromatic.	episode_done:True
text:Do you: 1) keep all of your wardrobe equally diverse, or 2) keep all of your wardrobe minimal, or 3) keep some pieces relatively similar while diversifying others?	labels:I keep most of my wardrobe relatively similar.  My work outfit is one of five pairs of pants, a button down, or a tee with a blazer.  My weekend uniform is athletic wear or jeans with a tank or tee in one of like five colors.  Mostly everything is black, gray, white, light blue, navy, with some camel and tomato red.  Only dresses really deviate here.    I play with shoes, makeup, and sunglasses to mix up my basic wardrobe.  And my bikini collection is relatively extensive, I have more bikinis than pairs of pants.	episode_done:True
text:Do you: 1) keep all of your wardrobe equally diverse, or 2) keep all of your wardrobe minimal, or 3) keep some pieces relatively similar while diversifying others?	labels:In the old days where one got dressed I had somewhat of a personal uniform:   The perfect black pant (own four of them, cheap from h&m but perfect for me) plus the same blousish top in all nice colors they sell it in (short and long sleeve) plus cardigans in all nice colors they sell it in, though mostly black ones. Some neutral blazers. Some dresses.  For fancy appointments I own the same etui dress and blazer combination in black, navy and grey.   Shoes black leather (ballerina, winter, closed shoe, pumps).   My whole wardrobe fits in one ikea pax (1 meter/3 ft). Generally it is boring bottoms and some more color for the tops. I always feel huge in colored pants.

I'm definitely a closet maximalist and I love having very varied pieces. Always have been like this too, in college people liked to joke that they've never seen me repeat an outfit.   I will say some of my stuff fits similarly. Like MOST of my pants are high waisted skinnies, but in a bunch of colors/patterns. I have like...10-12 beanies that are all different colors...  I'd say my handbags is the part of my wardrobe I change out the least. I have a black pleather mini backpack and a beige woven cross body that are my go-tos, with like 3 other bags for special occasions.	episode_done:True

text:Do you: 1) keep all of your wardrobe equally diverse, or 2) keep all of your wardrobe minimal, or 3) keep some pieces relatively similar while diversifying others?	labels:My closet definitely has #3 vibes. I go out of my way to thrift EVERYTHING besides specific pieces I’m in need of. I have a very boho/neo-hippy style with some funky pieces. When it comes to bottoms, I like to be consistent with skinny jeans, mom cut jeans, and harem pants. Then, I usually style a patterned shirt or t shirt with basic pants. If I have some funky pants, I’ll throw on a mono colored shirt. For shoes, I almost always wear docs (I have a black 1460 8-eye pair & a brown 1460 pascal leather pair) or vans (my 20 year-old spirit is shining through lol).	episode_done:True

text:Do you: 1) keep all of your wardrobe equally diverse, or 2) keep all of your wardrobe minimal, or 3) keep some pieces relatively similar while diversifying others?	labels:I have evolved some classics I keep- I admit I dress a bit like a children's book illustration character from the first half of the last century meets femdom faerie sex witch- so it's a lot of simple collared blouse under unornemented cashmere sweaters, black opaque tights, solid saturated colours largely in jewel tones, positively ridiculous big hair bows and then flip flop into corsets and strapy, or lacey things.    I go through periods of realizing a 34 year old wearing thigh highs with maryjanes is confusing and periods of comforting myself that the lesbian in clarks and stripey socks look makes me happy and as an elder-millenenial I am basically a generation adrift.    Probably the hardest part is realizing I don't have to buy new clothing. Like, I have enough of most things and it doesn't wear out fast enough to justify replacing it, nor does it really no longer spark joy.    I have stuff that fits from college that still has *years* of wear left. Unless I gain another 20lbs more than my natural yoyo, or suddenly take up a physical job, basically only socks, shoes and underwear will need updates from just material failure.	episode_done:True
text:Do you: 1) keep all of your wardrobe equally diverse, or 2) keep all of your wardrobe minimal, or 3) keep some pieces relatively similar while diversifying others?	labels:The majority of my closet follows the capsule wardrobe mentality. Colours are black, white, tan, navy & stripes. Mix of tops and bottoms that generally work well with each other for mixing it up.  I live in a hot climate as well so am slowing swapping all my fast fashion over to linen clothes as they fall apart.  My only exception to this capsule wardrobe are my bohemian, flowy, colourful print dresses (brand is Jaase if anyone wants to know) that are great for the beach, pool or hot weather. No need to pair these with anything as they are dresses. But outside of this, I stick to my standard capsule wardrobe :)	episode_done:True

text:What types of dresses would it be practical to have on hand for common different wedding types?	labels:I would maybe get a dress for each season. You don’t want to go to a winter wedding in a summer dress and with so many weddings coming up there’s bound to be one in each season.
text:That’s a really good point, but could you elaborate on what makes a dress appropriate for certain seasons, other than temperature considerations? I wear jeans and t-shirts all year long, so I’m very ignorant in this whole area.	labels:A summer dress could be more breezy fabrics, light florals, pastels. Winter could be heavier fabrics like velvet or long sleeves, darker florals could work for winter or fall.	episode_done:True
text:What types of dresses would it be practical to have on hand for common different wedding types?	labels:I literally just spent a lot of time picking a “wedding guest” dress and one thing I tried to take into consideration was the fact that I don’t go to a lot of weddings, so I tried to nab something that will fit me through weight fluctuation since I plan to rewear it to weddings in the future. I also tried to aim for the middle ground between “covered enough to wear to a conservative wedding” and “not so dowdy I feel 30 years older than I am”. A wrap dress to the knee ended fitting this bill for me!
text:Agree with you on buying for weight fluctuations--the dresses that have lasted me through the years tend to either tie at the waist or are designed to be looser in the waist area. In my 20s I definitely gravitated toward more form fitting dresses and while I don't regret buying those at all, they are long gone... however if I found a sleeker fitting piece today for the right price and the right specific event, I probably wouldn't pass it up. But for future events TBD I definitely play it safe.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:That’s a really good point, but could you elaborate on what makes a dress appropriate for certain seasons, other than temperature considerations? I wear jeans and t-shirts all year long, so I’m very ignorant in this whole area.	labels:To me, a winter dress either has long sleeves or is worn with a blazer/jacket to cover up short sleeves. Winter dresses are either long (past the knee) or if it is short, is worn with dark colored stockings/nylons/leggings. Winter dresses are typically darker colors- blacks, browns, dark green, navy, burgundy, etc.  A summer dress is usually lighter in fabric and lighter in color- whites, yellows, periwinkle, taupe, etc. A summer dress can be long- but if it’s long than the top should be short sleeved or tank top/halter etc so you don’t overheat.	episode_done:True
text:What types of dresses would it be practical to have on hand for common different wedding types?	labels:Not white, not red and depending on area, not black. White and red are the bride's colors (culturally dependent). If the bride wears white, red can be considered attention grabbing. If the bride wears red, her culture probably views white as a mourning color. Black can be seen as an objection to the wedding and mourning - very regional.   Something conservative enough for church weddings. Knee length, covers shoulders? Shoulder covering can be fixed with a cardigan.   Something light for a hot outdoor wedding.   In my area, most weddings are cocktail or semi formal aka short dresses are fine. Formal would imply floor length gown, so if the store has a good one, that you like, and you think someone seems more likely to go full formal, that might be a good call.   If you have seasons, then one for each season. Think about the weather in your general area. How cold or hot does it get?
text:> not red  Christ, yes. One of my old college buddies who I haven't been close to in like a decade wore a bright red dress to my wedding. The photographer took a million photos of her, to the exclusion of older family members I'd have rather had photos of. Part of that's on the photographer, of course, but it wouldn't have happened if she hadn't worn BRIGHT RED.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What types of dresses would it be practical to have on hand for common different wedding types?	labels:I would maybe get a dress for each season. You don’t want to go to a winter wedding in a summer dress and with so many weddings coming up there’s bound to be one in each season.
text:That’s a really good point, but could you elaborate on what makes a dress appropriate for certain seasons, other than temperature considerations? I wear jeans and t-shirts all year long, so I’m very ignorant in this whole area.	labels:Mainly the temperature aspect but there are definitely some preferable color pallets for different seasons. Specifically the temperature one though.	episode_done:True
text:What types of dresses would it be practical to have on hand for common different wedding types?	labels:One short cocktail length and one long if you feel like it. I personally wear fancy cocktail dresses no matter how fancy the wedding  I like black and navy bc you can rewear a ton. Color is great too. Just go for classic cuts.	episode_done:True
text:What types of dresses would it be practical to have on hand for common different wedding types?	labels:Personally I try to avoid maxi dresses. I just feel that because the wedding party is often wearing floor length dresses I don't want to look like I'm trying to be part of the wedding party when I'm not. For this reason I also don't wear whatever the wedding colors are. So I would try to get a few different colors of dresses so that way you can try to avoid looking like you're trying to be part of the wedding party.  Also don't get too short or revealing, you don't want to look like you're trying to take away from the bride's attention. Also don't wear white for this reason.	episode_done:True
text:What types of dresses would it be practical to have on hand for common different wedding types?	labels:I would get:  - a knee length/mid-calf black, brown, grey, or navy dress (good for anything and you can pair with colourful accessories for a wedding if you want)  - a flowy maxi dress (good for outdoor weddings in hot weather)  - a fun one that is still appropriate.   Avoid:  - excessive cleavage  - tacky rhinestones  - white dresses and anything close to white.  - completely red dresses   - black dresses can be a bit somber but I think can work if accessorized properly. Try to make sure it isn't too funeral-looking.   Things to keep in mind:  - at least one dress that covers your shoulders might be a good idea for any more traditional/conservative weddings.  - keep the length classy  - look for timeless styles, dresses you can wear in almost any decade and look good. Your fun one you can have fun with and have it be a trend that might not work 5 years from now.  - don't buy a dress you don't have the undergarments for/don't plan on buying undergarments for. Eg. Do you have massive boobs, and can't wear strapless bras? Don't get a strapless dress.
text:Why avoid solid red?	labels:Depending on culture, red is the bride's color. It's like showing up in all white.
text:Exactly!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What types of dresses would it be practical to have on hand for common different wedding types?	labels:I'd get something dark that would work with a coat for cold weather (if you have cold weather there) and a spring/summer dress.   Weddings in my family involve lots of food and lots of dancing, so I always wear something that's comfortable like a wrap dress or floatier fabric vs. something stiffer and structured, but that's just me.	episode_done:True
text:Skirts and dresses in winter - how to look good and be warm with a combo of boots, socks, tights?	labels:This may not be everyone's cup of tea but I love wearing oversized long sweaters or sweater dresses with sheer tights and then thigh highs over that. I'll usually wear this with combat boots or some type of heeled boot as ankle booties don't look great on me. You can also wear this with a skirt/shorts and a sweater and then a coat on top. Add a hat, scarf, gloves as needed.  This combo worked great for me in the fall when I lived in Canada.	episode_done:True
text:Skirts and dresses in winter - how to look good and be warm with a combo of boots, socks, tights?	labels:I agree with you about black tights looking weird with certain outfits...my answer is that I specifically buy my winter skirts/dresses to look good with black tights lol. If it doesn't, then it's just not gonna be worn in the fall/winter, it's too cold where I live for bare legs and I have never really found other colors/patterns of tights that I like the look of. Plus it means that everything also matches with black boots so it just makes things easy.  Also I just want to shout the praises of fleece lined tights from the rooftop. Those and loose fitting dress=ultimate comfort, but looks like you tried. I agree with the other commenter who suggested sizing up in tights, they never fit right when I got my true size, now that I size up I don't feel like I'm constantly adjusting them throughout the day anymore.	episode_done:True
text:Skirts and dresses in winter - how to look good and be warm with a combo of boots, socks, tights?	labels:I also hate pants for the same reasons as you. But I also live in a Nordic country which is hella cold.   I just wear thights that are made of comfortable quality fabrics (sometimes cotton/wool blends) and I buy at LEAST one size bigger than my actual size, with wide waistbands. I want comfort above all, and for me this works.  Also if I only had to deal with cold weathers in the morning, frankly I would just put the thights on in the morning and then take them off later and put them in my bag.	episode_done:True
text:Skirts and dresses in winter - how to look good and be warm with a combo of boots, socks, tights?	labels:I live in the freezing north and I still wear skirts in the winter. Because I'm insane and like to look like I'm from the 1890s. (I wear fleece or thick cotton tights with long wool skirts.)  My personal thought is that the height of the shoes doesn't matter if it's wet out. I will just wear snow boots or rain boots if those are called for, and fuck the aesthetic.   If it's just dry but cold, my personal rule of thumb:  * Higher skirt = higher shaft, longer skirt = lower shaft. Basically, ankle boots with ankle-length skirts, knee-high boots or thigh-high boots with miniskirts. * I include a contrasting-color knee sock as "the shaft," so a knee-high boot with a miniskirt is equivalent to an ankle boot plus knee-high socks with a miniskirt. * I sometimes layer tights with knee socks/thigh-highs or just wear the socks alone, and if the socks are calling attention to themselves (either by color or pattern), I wear them with ankle boots to show off the socks.	episode_done:True
text:Skirts and dresses in winter - how to look good and be warm with a combo of boots, socks, tights?	labels:I do not like black opaque tights very often. I love a patterned sheer-ish tight - with polka dots or some other thing. A loose enough pattern that hints at your skin below.. I have also had grey sheer pattern tights and other shades, but I a dark skinned black woman, so I have some different color constraints. I generally prefer darker tights over paler ones since I am darker.   As for ankle boot height? I prefer right around the ankle, or even something that has more of a profile of a shoe. I am not a big sock wearer, but if I do want ones to be visible, the need to be an interesting pair,   I'd pick colors that mimic your skin tone or pickup a shade in the dress/skirt you are wearing. I also do not love big contrast between the sock and the tight. But it depends, if the tight matches the dress/skirt - then contrast in the shoe is fine. But otherwise I like the shoe and tight to be closer together.	episode_done:True
text:Skirts and dresses in winter - how to look good and be warm with a combo of boots, socks, tights?	labels:What length skirts do you gravitate toward?  Most of my skirts/dresses are mini or midi length, so I usually wear ankle boots or knee high boots.  I like my ankle boots to hit at the thinnest part of my ankle (right above the bone) and my knee high boots just below my knees.    I’m not a huge fan of mid calf, because that cuts off my leg in an awkward place and I don’t have enough leg to be doing that. (I’m 5’1”.)  My choice of boot depends on  1) how cold it will be 2) how long I’ll be in the cold 3) my coat  For example, if I’m going for a girls night (pre covid) I might decide to wear a mini with ankle boots, but have a longer coat that I can keep me warm if we’re moving around.  If I’m going to the farmers market, I might decide to wear a midi dress with knee high boots and a wool coat, so I can take my time.  I’m a big fan of knee high boots with midi dresses and long coats. The overlap really keeps out the cold. It’s definitely a 70s kind of vibe which isn’t everyone’s cup of tea. but maybe people will come around because Nicole Kidman rocked this vibe in the undoing...	episode_done:True

text:Skirts and dresses in winter - how to look good and be warm with a combo of boots, socks, tights?	labels:Heist brand tights have tops like leggings and legs like tights if that make sense. So comfy! I pair those with short Chelsea boots and dresses. Or wedge booties.	episode_done:True
text:Skirts and dresses in winter - how to look good and be warm with a combo of boots, socks, tights?	labels:Leggings under dresses instead of tights (with tall or mid boots).  Also, footless tights (I have a great pair from spanx).  I always wear athletic socks w boots ( as long as they can’t be seen).  Way more comfortable!	episode_done:True
text:Skirts and dresses in winter - how to look good and be warm with a combo of boots, socks, tights?	labels:I see people wear black tights with light colored or even spring dresses and I can’t stand it! Black tights don’t go with everything! Personally, in winter it’s all about fabrics. Heavy fabrics will look better with your boots and tights. I have a pair of black suede thigh high boots that keep my legs warm and go with pretty much everything in my closet. If I think black is too harsh, I have brown heeled booties that I wear with various patterned nude tights. Also sweater dresses are amazing because you can wear them with actual leggings and any boot! I also have a coat that’s nearly floor length to keep my legs warm if need be.	episode_done:True

But now, I am in hatelove with a gigantic chunky green sweater from Target that cost me all of $22, but I wash and dry it as if it were some high end boutique item from a Brooklyn designer. Gentle cycle, cold water. Fluff. Hang dry. And then I wear it again for 3 days in a row without makeup because I can't even begin to relate to my stylish clothes. They seem like old friends I've lost touch with and I forget what we have in common.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:I got two black pairs of Uggs a couple Christmases ago. One pair is the classic length and one is the shorter ankle length. Both incredibly comfy and versatile with my mostly black wardrobe. I went through a phase last winter where didn't wear them because I read this article that basically shit on adults who wore Uggs. My parents spent a good deal of money to get me them and I asked for them, and let a random bitter writer shame me out of wearing them. This year of the pandemic has brought about a new side of my personality that's just like "fuck you, life is too short and fragile to not wear what I want and be cozy AF" and I do not regret it.  I'm not hate wearing my Uggs, I'm spite wearing them.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Jewelry trends for 2021	labels:I feel like delicate, minimalist jewelry in general is here to stay for a while longer among the general populous (I personally think minimalist gold jewelry is timeless). It's easy to maintain and it goes with any outfit; can be a day and night piece.  Might just be me, but I feel that high fashion is always trying to promote the big, bold, statement jewelry, which is fine! The way you describe your style mixed with the beautiful pieces you like, it sounds like it fits you to a T. Just not sure if it is trending that direction though. But I think that you should shrug off today's "standards" and wear what makes you feel happy and confident!
text:I think minimalist or non-statement jewelry is timeless to an extent like a simple colour t-shirt is timeless. The super, super, tiny and delicate pieces (a ring that's so thin it's almost invisible) will probably trend towards slightly thicker but still delicate pieces.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:It’s also literally timeless if you are buying 14k/18k jewelry - it will last for years with the right care! Which also makes the delicate style more attainable in that regard - less gold material ($$$) needed.  I do think there will be some post-recession/depression like trends that will start emerge in 2021, but only to one or two items in an outfit. Like for some, it may be adding fun, costume jewelry and for others it might be reflected in flouncier dresses or statement bags, etc. It’s tough to predict and may not happen until after the vaccine reaches the majority, but I’m here to see it!	labels:Be careful about certain pieces, though. Some wear down over time and you can actually lose your stone/diamond (you should get your ring checked every couple of years if it has a prong setting).	episode_done:True

Blazers, too: anything with strong shoulders, a nipped waist and a slightly longer length.   Silk scarves and vintage clip on earrings—I have a bit of an obsession with both. The combination can dress up a lazy outfit in seconds, in a way that's appropriate for any occasion.  Flowy midi skirts and dresses, especially pleated or wrap-around designs. Much more comfortable than jeans, and eye-catching, too.  Blouses: button-front silk shirts, cotton Liberty prints, and anything white/cream with lace or ruffles.  And because we're still in a pandemic...silk satin face masks. I've actually enjoyed matching them to my outfits!

text:How do you style your existing wardrobe in a way that doesn’t get boring?	labels:Definitely a different shoe style. If I’m not wanting to buy a whole new on trend wardrobe, a simple pair of shoes and how I style my hair for the day goes a long  way to “add a bit of spice” as the kids say.   Ex. Keds—> docs. Tan wedges --> black platforms. Ballet flats —> loafers. Bootie—>blundstone. High heel —> sneaker. Obviously stick to the style you want, but imo shoes completely change an outfit.	episode_done:True
text:How do you style your existing wardrobe in a way that doesn’t get boring?	labels:I've found that actually cutting down on the number of clothes that I have (selling what I can, donating the rest), has actually helped me be more thoughtful and creative about what I do have, rather than being overwhelmed by the sheer number and defaulting to basics.  Stylebook is great at well - building looks, having the app randomly create outfits for you, but also saving inspiration photos. Sometimes I see people on IG and think "wow that outfit is so great!" and when I really look at it closer, I realize that I'll have similar items in my closet already, but I didn't think to combine them in that way. So I save those photos in the Stylebook app as a reminder of how I can shake up my basics. If you do choose to use the app, you'll see what you actually wear and may feel a bit more justified in letting go of pieces you don't reach for that are sunk costs & taking up space.	episode_done:True
text:How do you style your existing wardrobe in a way that doesn’t get boring?	labels:I play in my closet a lot. Just take a Saturday and try on different combinations.

I follow style that's like mine and then of course where I aspire to be or just that I find interesting and different.	episode_done:True
text:How do you style your existing wardrobe in a way that doesn’t get boring?	labels:I have a similar style and I like adding 1-2 accessories to a basic outfit. My favorite is scarves! Not only can they be cute and lightweight, they can also be cute and big and cozy, like you’re wearing a blanket all day but it’s socially acceptable. Other accessories could be a pair of statement earrings, or a chunky belt, or a long necklace. Sometimes I just try different hair styles to feel like I’m doing something different.	episode_done:True
text:How do you style your existing wardrobe in a way that doesn’t get boring?	labels:Okay I am totally in the same spot as you. So tired of wearing grey, I want to rid my closet of the colour. The best solution and not to rid your whole closet is to buy colourful accessories or go to a consignment store and buy statement pieces to wear with your basic wardrobe that would be at discounted prices compared to online retail like Free People and Anthropologie  (I recommend not going to thrift stores because that's more basics typically). I also have a rule that if a t-shirt or any article of clothing hasn't been worn in the last 6 months its time to donate it, that's at least 2 seasons of wearing it not being utilized. As for up-cycling your own old clothes you can buy fun iron on patches that can be added on plain hoodies or t-shirts for a pop of colour much like the brands Comme de Garcons and Scotch and Soda.  You can also embroider shirt collars, or the pockets of jeans.	episode_done:True
text:How do you style your existing wardrobe in a way that doesn’t get boring?	labels:Echoing a few suggestions here re: accessories and shoes with some examples I’ve done this fall/winter.  My standard fall/winter wardrobe is also a sweater, jeans and ankle boots. Some variations I’ve tried:  I saw Pinterest inspo of statement red socks with Oxfords and I usually only wear oxfords in spring/summer because it feels too cold in fall winter. I bought a pair of red/burgundy cashmere socks from j crew and wore those today with my black oxfords, black jeans and white sweater with black stripes.  Wearing “dressy” sneakers. I bought some MOMA vans, I have a out of burgundy suede and tweed new balance sneakers I wear to work and I want to get a basic black pair of adidas shoes. Similar goes for slip on sneakers, I have a pair of Kate spade leopard print Keds and a red leather pair of Olukais with a pretty floral design.  I have an amazing blanket scarf and even wearing a very thin black sweater or long sleeve t shirt with the blanket scarf I always get compliments even though that’s my comfy outfit. It’s not a chunky sweater but it’s still warm.  When I want to look a bit dressier I really do love wearing sweater dresses or just thicker regular dresses and tights/leggings with ankle boots as well. For slightly thinner dresses throwing a long cardigan over top.	episode_done:True
text:How do you style your existing wardrobe in a way that doesn’t get boring?	labels:I am a very ordinary person so take this with a grain of salt. What I would do is a commitment to wear sth "new" every day. It's just not how you put it on and look at the mirror, but it also has to do with how you feel in it all day long.   Sometimes it's gonna work, sometimes it won't but you can have fun with your wardrobe everyday and hopefully you will find what goes well with what you have inside that huge wardrobe.   You are young so you can be daring.  You will be surprised.  Good luck and happy trying :)	episode_done:True
text:How do you style your existing wardrobe in a way that doesn’t get boring?	labels:Shoes and other accessories can be much cheaper to own and can completely change the vibe of an outfit. A different pair of shoes alone can take basically the same outfit from grandpa-core to vintage feminine to streetwear. For example I have pretty basic black cotton blend dress that I can wear with platform sneakers for a streetwear look, with flats or booties with pearl or diamond earrings for a "classy casual extra feminine" daytime look, and thigh high boots and berry lipstick for a "baddie" look on a night out.  Jewelry, makeup, and shoes are just fun easy ways to play with being someone else for a day without own multiple different sets of actual clothing. In my experience costume jewelry and second-hand or outlet retail shoes (like from places like TJ Maxx, Ross, Burlington, etc.) hold up much better for the lower prices than fast fashion fabrics do. So I like to get quality clothing and basic accessories, but then have cheaper more "out there" accessories/stuff for variety and experimental/trendy moments.  That ends up being way cheaper and more sustainable than buying a new top or skirt that will fall apart or be out of style in a year every time I want to feel different for a little bit. A change in hair and makeup is even cheaper and more sustainable because often you can use the same products, but just with different techniques/styles.	episode_done:True
text:How do you style your existing wardrobe in a way that doesn’t get boring?	labels:Here is what I recommend:  1. Spend time in your closet regularly creating outfits. Most people know how to dress themselves, know what they like, etc. but they do not put the work/time into working with their wardrobe, or they do not do it enough. Set aside a time every few months to do it, even if it is just a mental effort of thinking out ideas and writing them down. 2. Constantly experiment. Wardrobe items turn into outfits and looks when there are elements and aspects to the look -- layering items, color combinations, mixing prints, etc. If your style tends to be neutral/basic, then this can be achieved with elements to the items like different necklines, trim and details, etc. 3. Try to create at least 3 outfits or more with each item you have. Make it a practice including when you are considering making a purchase -- i.e, what three outfits can I make if I buy this? 4. It is good to look for inspiration, but if you don't take time to make looks, it will not be useful and effective. 5. Understand your default/go-to looks and items and work them differently. Next time you french tuck the sweater with the jeans and boots, maybe try cuffing the jeans, or layering the sweater with something, or doing something unexpected with the look. This will broaden the use of your wardrobe items.  It can be helpful to have someone else you know come into your closet and show you how they'd work your wardrobe items. You could post photos of items here and ask people, "how would you wear this?" that could spark some new ideas as well.	episode_done:True
text:How do you style your existing wardrobe in a way that doesn’t get boring?	labels:I catalogued all my clothes in an app and track what I wear. If I want to wear something different\~\~\~ then I look at the category of "unworn" clothing and pick something to make an outfit with. It's really helped me make sure I wear as much of my clothes as possible (obviously the black cocktail dress is going to see less use than the everyday pink sweater but it helps with more unique items like my t shirt with applique parrots lol). If you don't want to catalogue your clothes and put this much effort into it (lol) you could just move your clothes to another part of your closet after you wear them or reverse the orientation of the hangers after wearing. Try to move as much of your clothes to the "worn" side of your closet as possible. And when you pick a lesser worn item don't give up and just make an outfit of it! Who cares if it doesn't match perfectly, you'll do it better next time!	episode_done:True
text:How do I know if my sense of style is really mine or is it defined by others?	labels:I think that how you want to be perceived is representative of who you are. This is something I've battled with over the years, not just in terms of clothes, but behavior, etc. We try to act better than we think we are, we try to dress based on how our ideal "me" would dress. At times it might feel fake, like you are pretending, but the truth is that us striving to improve ourselves (based on what we define as "improvement") is one of the biggest indicators of who we are.  Obviously in a way, our taste in clothes will be dictated by people around us, but that's true for everything in life.  At the end of the day, if what you are wearing makes you feel good, then that is your sense of style. If it ever changes, that is because of changes to who you are. We are not static, we grow and change based on our environment and internal growth, and all of those are great :)
text:This is so inspiring! I’ve always been sort of hesitant about wearing certain clothes and styles (eg. Boho, chic/sexy) even if I really like them, because I feel fake just like you mentioned, almost like I don’t deserve to dress like that because my personality doesn’t necessarily match the type of personality I associate with those styles.   But what you said about improving ourselves and how that relates to fashion is such an uplifting outlook. especially since I’m working on growing as a person and what to adopt more traits that I associate with the styles that I admire like confidence and a more laidback/spontaneous outlook.   Thank you so much for this amazing advice. I’m excited to carry this attitude with me into the new year.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do I know if my sense of style is really mine or is it defined by others?	labels:One thing you could do in search of your "real tastes" is to make a Pinterest board (or equivalent) of pictures you find beautiful and evocative - pictures that do NOT include clothing. If you think about style in terms of anything else - home decor, for instance - don't include that either. Think pictures of landscapes, animals, buildings, even abstract art. It sounds crazy but it really works - patterns will emerge. For instance, my board includes things like white billowy curtains, pink clouds, sea glass, foggy beach pictures. There's a general mood that I can't really describe or quantify through more defined "style groups" like goth, boho, romantic, etc. It's just what I find beautiful.   From there, find parallels to clothing. White billowy curtains -> white billowy blouses. Pink clouds -> pink fluffy sweaters. Sea glass -> sea glass jewelry! Foggy beach pictures -> muted colors, soft textures. If you are more artistic you might not even want to create clear-cut parallels but would prefer to think in "moods," whether a certain piece of clothing evokes the same mood as your board. That works too.  I get that how you want to be perceived is part of you too, but I still think it's useful to understand your more fundamental aesthetic preferences. Personally, I feel like after spending awhile in the world of style bloggers, youtubers, etc. it's easy to appreciate a huge variety of styles or to like certain things only because of exposure. It makes it hard to hone down what exactly you want from your own look. For ME, moving outside the world of clothing seems to do the trick.	episode_done:True
text:How do I know if my sense of style is really mine or is it defined by others?	labels:I don’t think you can be 100% original (Did you sew your own clothes? Create the patterns? Dye the yarn?), so I’d just ask myself if I like what I’m wearing, and if others disliking it bothers me.	episode_done:True
text:How do I know if my sense of style is really mine or is it defined by others?	labels:Both go hand in hand, and usually the confidence that comes with those fashion choices will end up building up to a style you may finally feel your own; although I think everything is influenced by something else, so just enjoy dressing up to whatever you feel suits you and your mood!	episode_done:True
text:How do I know if my sense of style is really mine or is it defined by others?	labels:I've always wondered this myself. Early on in my career I used clothes to signal maturity. I'm 100% WFH now and I've suddenly realized that I really do like dressing up and I do dress for myself.  That means 4 days I week I'm edgier and bolder than before -- I have a much bigger range than I thought. I've always worn a ton of dresses and skirts -- still do but it so many different silhouettes and patterns. The other 3 days I am in black leggings and a comfy sweater.  However, I think when I return to the office I'll still dress for the job I want, but after work change back into my Doc Martins.	episode_done:True
text:How do I know if my sense of style is really mine or is it defined by others?	labels:There is no way your sense of style isn't defined by others. It's impossible, everything we wear and do is marketed to us	episode_done:True
text:How do I know if my sense of style is really mine or is it defined by others?	labels:In art school, we learned about finding out own aesthetic. Finding it involved copying others' work for a while (never for profit, btw). We learned how to develop our own hand in this process, what worked for us and what didn't. In turn, our aesthetics became really a combination of several other artists.   I think fashion and style is the same. There's influences of who we follow, but the more we try and experiment, determining what works for us and what doesn't, is when our unique style will emerge - and it'll still even then be a combination of several other styles. Experiment, figure out what's important to you in your own style. It takes time and intention.	episode_done:True
text:How do I know if my sense of style is really mine or is it defined by others?	labels:I know that social media can subconsciously influence the way we perceive ourselves and the world around us. Perhaps try taking a little break/limit time from exposure to social media? It might change the way you dress. Also, I find that educating myself about the world of fashion has really opened my eyes to all the possible things that one can wear, so maybe try reading up on some fashion history/watching educational videos to hopefully gain a deeper appreciation for garments? But honestly, the "real you" should be the you that you feel most comfortable and happiest in. Good luck!	episode_done:True
text:How do I know if my sense of style is really mine or is it defined by others?	labels:For a while I struggled with this as well. But then I realized that If you see something that someone else is wearing or is admiring someone’s style, in a way that really is your style too. If you like it on you, you can wear in and have it be a part of you. IMO it doesn’t matter if your style differs from day to day. One time I saw someone with a super cool black outfit on the street and straight up copied it from what I had home, and I loved to wear it! Next day I wore something flowery inspired from a fashion commercial! Felt great in that too.   Clothes can be very fun if you let them! Best of luck.	episode_done:True
text:How do I know if my sense of style is really mine or is it defined by others?	labels:There's that saying that "you don't know what you don't know", right? I couldn't conjure up a completely original and personal style out of thin air without pulling up inspiration and learning about all kinds of different styles and clothes and fabrics and aesthetics et cetera et cetera. My style is just a big mix of all kinds of trends from the last five years, but it's personal to me because I curated it.  I like to think of personal style as an iterative process similar to design, you build on top of what's already there, see what works, what doesn't, remove unnecessary things until there's nothing left to take away. What remains is just right. The one thing to realise is that it's not something that happens overnight, most people who have a really strong sense of personal style have been doing it for years or decades.	episode_done:True

Sometimes I look at these clothes and decide that I missed this or that, but most of the time, it gets cycled out after a while and donated somewhere.   I live in a very small apartment, though, and I dislike the extra work that comes with too much clutter.

I’m into crazy colors now because they make me so happy to wear and I don’t feel like my soul’s been wrapped in a beige condom for eternity.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Which color palette do you hate wearing?	labels:I dislike neon bright colors. I do own a few things for visibility when walking/running but would almost rather be hit by a car.
text:This is what I was going to say. Neons are the worst.  I remember when I was in middle school and neon skinny jeans were a huge trend. I'm still haunted by the sadness I felt going into Ross to buy jeans and seeing nothing but a sea of pink, green, and yellow.	labels:	episode_done:True

While the album primarily depicts men, women and individuals whose sex and gender are unknown to me also make up a fair proportion.  I tend to steal a lot of inspo from FFA myself, so I hope this might be useful to someone here or otherwise provide some uncommon inspiration.	episode_done:True
text:Fashion "fantasies" coming true years later?	labels:A little bit different, but I remember as a kid being like "man, wish I had the confidence to wear belly shirts, they look so cool" or whatever we called them back in the 00s, and now that they're being styled with high waisted pants and skirts it's like, the best of both worlds, in that I don't have to have my full stomach out and it's way cuter this way anyways. AND the nigh waisted/crop solved the issue I had with clothes and my wide hips: low-rise pants would slide down and shirts would always ride up unless they were loose enough, so I would have to CONSTANTLY adjust.  And on the reverse note, any shirt I have that isn't cropped gets tucked in, which is funny considering how ridiculous it always seemed to me to tuck in shirts back then too.	episode_done:True

text:What are your 2021 Fashion / Style Goals?	labels:I’m generally happy with my wardrobe but I simply have too much - too much clothing, too many shoes, too many bags, etc. It’s getting to be overwhelming. I would like to try to do a low/no buy year to keep me from accumulating more, while simultaneously trying to declutter what I already have. If I do make purchases I want to think about them long and hard, and really justify why I need them. I also want the item to be perfect if I’m going to buy it - I have a bad habit of buying things that are « good enough » in the pursuit of what I really want and that’s definitely contributed to my overflowing wardrobe. No more settling for « good enough », it’s a waste of money & close space!	episode_done:True
text:What are your 2021 Fashion / Style Goals?	labels:My goal is to only buy pieces I actually love. No shopping because I'm sad or bored.

I'm allowed one item per month in the following categories (with exceptions carved out).  This is one item PERIOD, not one shirt and one lipstick.  I can either get the shirt or the lipstick.  Makeup, clothing (including bras, underwear, and socks), accessories, shoes (can replace only worn out athletic shoes), tech including headphones/charging cables (can replace my laptop or phone should they die), books, craft supplies (unless I get a custom Etsy order and need something for it), stationary/office supplies (I can only buy a 2022 planner).    I'm really trying to fast-track the "financial goals' portion of my budget and I'm hoping this low-buy shifts my habits and diverts money from "wants" to financial goals.	episode_done:True

My drawers are overflowing with clothes that make me feel crappy.	episode_done:True
text:What are your 2021 Fashion / Style Goals?	labels:2021 I'm making an effort.   I can be a middle aged mom, and not be frumpy.   2020 I started out fine, but working from home and covid I sort of gave up. I stopped doing my hair, and stopped putting on makeup.  I stopped exercising (yoga pants and hoodies are so forgiving. Not to mention sports bras and cotton undies rather than sexy lingerie that made me stand up a little bit straighter and smile that secret smile to myself. )  I can be chubbier than I'd like right now, and still have nice style that makes me feel sexy and attractive and good about how I present myself.  I can wear cute shoes and accessorize again, even if I have a mask that covers my smile.   I can also take care of myself and enjoy exercise and healthy foods, and get to a place where I feel better about my body in a swimsuit.

text:What are your 2021 Fashion / Style Goals?	labels:My style goals for 2021:  1. Be more creative with my style. I want to wear my more funky and unique pieces more often, and to make some of my pieces more personal by embroidering them with cool designs.   2. Shop my closet. I probably have about 60 pieces all together including accessories (I know this from my Stylebook app) and I’ve realized that I can combine them in all sorts of new ways to create many different kinds of outfits.   2. Take videos of my crafted outfits. This has helped me a lot in seeing what is working on me and what needs a few tweaks. For example, I took a video of myself wearing a tucked in fitted turtleneck with high-waisted jeans and a belt. I felt it looked very nice in the mirror, but for some reason, it looked off in the video. I quickly realized that due to my height, my high-rise jeans weren’t hitting me at my natural waist, but were instead fitting closer to a mid rise. After noticing this, I experimented around with what I had, and settled on adding a unique 80’s jacket which made it look a lot more styled and proportionate.	episode_done:True

You can probably still buy them from LL Bean, like my Dad used to.  I'm enjoying the mixture of traditionally somewhat formal pieces mixed with the casual here,  ie tweed jacket with a hoodie.  Hadn't heard of Margaret Howell before.  She's definitely the queen of balancing the top piece with the bottom piece in unconventional ways. And her footwear styling really makes the whole look.

One of the biggest breakthroughs I had in terms of my style was accepting my new body/silhouette and figuring out what cuts work for my new body. With that extra weight, I ended up loving the way I looked in long, dark pencil skirts paired with a tucked in top. Additionally, I stopped caring about the number or the size of the garment. Sometimes I needed a size M, sometimes I needed a size XL. Once I got over that mental hurdle, shopping was so much easier.   &#x200B;  Addressing the lifestyle change: Not sure if this is the advice you wanted to hear, but this is what worked for me. My younger self's style was not office appropriate at all. I was into short sundresses and plunging necklines. My big "ah-hah" moment was realizing that I can have two styles. At work, I'm a walking advertisement for J.Crew and I feel so confident. Outside of work, I'm in a short dress and high heels. The trick for me was realizing that my body can pull off different silhouettes depending on the style. I enjoy form fitting outfits in my office wardrobe. Conversely, I enjoy flowy outfits in my non-office wardrobe.

text:Fashion to help your changing body and lifestyle?	labels:Lifestyle and body changes will take place and impact your wardrobe and style needs a few times over the course of your life, and 20s is sort of when most navigate this for the first time. The most important thing to determine is what if anything in your current wardrobe can work for you now, including your work looks, and what look you want to have with your style for work. This should fit into your industry and be appropriate, but it can still be 'you' (your vibe, etc.), it just takes some thought and planning. Clothing is 100% the wrapper so to speak we all wrap around ourselves, and can reflect who we are, where we are at in our lives, how we feel about ourselves, and alot of other aspects about yourselves. Aim to tie it as closely to you, and what your life needs are. That is how it has been effective for me here. If you want to share some workplace appropriate looks you like, we can help further!	episode_done:True
text:Fashion to help your changing body and lifestyle?	labels:Had something similar happen, and let me just say - the first step is to find two or three good pants that you feel good in. For me, it was to leave behind shops like forever21 or New Look, and I started shopping at shops like Torrid. I know some people hate torrid, and some of their clothes are cheesey. But let me just say - they do the BEST jeans. I have bought them in size 10, 12, 14, and 16, and they fit and grow with me as my body changed and fluctuated, and then when I lost some weight, the smaller pairs still fit.      Just remember, you have to ignore the size on the rack, and instead go based on what feels good. Good, buttery jeans that make your butt look rocking are a huge confidence booster for me. Tops that hid the ladies which grew sort of uncontrollable after changing the pill also helped. Structured blazers with t-shirts and dark jeans = perfect office look for any size. Statement necklace or simple earrings always a bonus. However you are, as you said, you deserve clothes that fit, so get em, girl!	episode_done:True
text:Fashion to help your changing body and lifestyle?	labels:Not really answering the question, but my issue has been the opposite. I'm about 10lbs lighter now than I was in high school, and I've stayed short and tiny my whole life. I basically kept my high school wardrobe all through college, then packed it with me when my husband and I got married and I moved. I didn't see the issue and thought it was ludicrous to get rid of an entire closet of clothes that were still intact and fit me well, until I started getting more serious about my career as a professor and realized my "professional teaching clothes" still read as "student attending an award ceremony."  Starting over the summer, I began weeding through my closet and donating anything that didn't make me happy or I couldn't imagine myself wearing in front of a classroom of college students or colleagues (except for my loungewear and workout clothes.) I felt A LOT of guilt at first, because I realized how many pieces I held onto for the nostalgia or just because they fit. I had to invite one of my closest friends over to help me make the tough decisions and she didn't let me talk myself into keeping a piece I initially put in the donate pile. That really helped my perspective, and now I can make more objective decisions without needing a cheerleader.   Once I got rid of about half of my closet (spring/summer and fall/winter wardrobe combined,) I gave myself permission to buy a few higher-end pieces that are much more my style but also fit both my daily life and professional needs. Neutral colors and versatile silhouettes. I feel so much less stress and guilt when I open my closet now, it really feels like I've moved into a new chapter of myself. It's my dream to have a 10-15 piece capsule closet, but one step at a time.  I'm so sorry I just went on a big tangent. It's been an enlightening quarantine for me obviously lol.	episode_done:True

text:Fashion to help your changing body and lifestyle?	labels:Me!! I am currently working through this - I actually created this new account specifically for FFA so I can feel more comfortable sharing outfits. 3 years ago I left a creative job to become a stay at home mom, and since then I had another baby and have been all over the place size-wise. Pre-kids I had a very defined personal style and was really connected to my local arts community and my wardrobe reflected that.   Now I’m kind of in a lost place (after two bouts of post-parting depression, the last one clearing up right as the pandemic started) and I have no idea how to integrate my personal style into my “new” lifestyle.   Currently I’m working on uploading my entire wardrobe to StyleBook, to hopefully track what I’m wearing every day to find trends so that I can clear out things I don’t wear or that don’t fit. I’ve also started browsing Pinterest and Instagram a lot more to encourage myself to wear things other than sweats every day. Even though I’m at home with two toddlers all the time, I think I feel better about myself when I put on real clothes that fit and make me feel happy!   I have a long way to go but you’re not alone!	episode_done:True
text:Fashion to help your changing body and lifestyle?	labels:I can't speak on the weight gain thing other than I'm sure you still look lovely and I hope you still feel beautiful right now as well. Weight gain is nothing to be ashamed of, but I commend you for trying to be healthier - that shit isn't easy!!  As for the "wanting to look professional but wanting to look / feel like myself", I think a LOT of people struggle with this. I feel like for the emo look, wearing all black can still be seen as very professional, I think the issue more would be the cuts of the clothes. It also depends on your profession / workplace - obviously some places are much more lenient and you can get away with a lot more skin. Maybe wearing jewelry that is more alternative can also be a good way to look professional but feel like yourself.	episode_done:True
text:Fashion to help your changing body and lifestyle?	labels:Are you me?!  Clothing is 100% the way I manage to feel even remotely confident in my body. I have by no means actually figured this out – especially since I gained weight during the pandemic AND had abdominal surgery (no more crop tops for now since I don’t care to explain the marks) this year – but these are my tips:  1) Get rid of stuff that doesn’t fit you. I’m not sure if what you’re describing with weight stabilizing in a stable relationship is eating-disordered behavior, but in my similar situation, it absolutely was. I am pretty triggered by things that don’t fit, especially across the bust, which leads to my next point...  2) Bra fitting changes everything. I love how you note your old style was “lots of boobs” because mine was too, but kind of by accident because I had ill-fitting bras, and, by transition, clothes. I cannot recommend r/abrathatfits enough because whether “lots of boobs” is still you or you want to transition from it, a well-fitted bra makes everything look more professional and makes everyone look incredible...and feel incredible, too!  3) Tailor to your favorite parts of you. So, I took this really radically and now make my clothes. But that’s not an option for everyone. What is, however, more of an option, is taking things in at the waist, getting things hemmed, and putting in darts (triangle folds) to better fit curves. Depending on where you live, these “operations” can cost like $9-20 only and make the biggest difference. I have stubby legs, a ridiculously short waist, and bras that work as hats, but in my clothes that actually fit me, you don’t see those traits so much as the total look...and I like that look! I think tailoring is the best way to make clothes work FOR you, not you have to work around the clothes.  I hope that helps!!	episode_done:True
text:Fashion to help your changing body and lifestyle?	labels:I had an accident earlier this year and now have a slow-healing wound on my knee that won’t close up. I have to wear a dressing on it, so tight jeans are a no-go. I got into the habit of dressing down every day, at first because of the pain, which was unpleasant for the first few weeks, and then because I felt down about the injury (and Covid-life in general).  It was a bit of a revelation when I realised some of the more interesting trousers in my wardrobe are perfectly fine to wear, as they accommodate the dressing. It’s been reassuring to know that even if my body isn’t moving in the same way as before, I can still get dressed up if I want to. There’s definitely some restorative power in pulling on a decent outfit from time to time.
text:I had a similar no jeans allowed dilemma! I have a medical problem that makes tight pants/denim not an option (except the occasional legging day). At first that meant I had wear the few pairs of androgynous-looking joggers which is a fun style but started to make me feel really frumpy and sad having to wear them every day. Now I’ve built up some trousers that look more put together and have a loose fit and conveniently usually an adjustable waistband, which has worked great for my recent weight gain. As a result I’ve also become much fonder of tight tops to balance out the looser pants.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What were the fashion finds that made you cry of happiness?	labels:It’s funny, I came in to this thread to share the time I found a pair of suede Stuart Weitzman boots in my size in perfect condition for like $25 at a thrift store. I wear them all the time and they’re still in great shape after like 5 years. Enjoy your 5050s!  Less fancy but still memorable: we had just moved cross country for my husband’s job and I got an immediate call back from a job I applied for. Like, they called me the same day I applied and asked if I could interview the next day. All our stuff was in transit, and I had been planning to take some time off before my next job, so I had nothing to interview in and a suit is pretty much expected in my field.  I went to J. Crew, Banana Republic, Ann Taylor, LOFT, etc that afternoon and somehow NONE of them had suits in my size. The best I could find was one from Ann Taylor in a color I hated with an inseam that was 5 inches too long.   HOWEVER, I randomly passed a Salvation Army on my way home and decided to check it out. Friends, I found 4 beautiful J. Crew suits in my exact size, already hemmed to my ideal length within like 2 minutes of walking in the door. I’m pretty sure I actually did cry.   I didn’t end up taking that job (you will not be surprised to hear that it had very chaotic energy!) but I still have—and love—those suits.

text:Let me ask you a few questions here...do you even like these clothes or are you more comfortable in something else? Are you dressing for you or for men? If for men, if a man is disappointed by what you're "hiding" then he's not worth it. There are plenty of great men out there who like you and your body just the way you are and they don't really care what you're wearing.   I would say we are all hiding some flaw...for me, I'm hiding my mom pooch belly. I can hide it well in clothes, but naked...nope! It is right out there. If someone doesn't like that then that's on them and speaks to how shallow they are, which is an instant turn off for me.  Love yourself first.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:I have a similar body type, though recently it’s gotten very slightly curvier. I’ve felt the same way, but literally everyone does this, not just us! Clothes create illusions. You’re not a fraud at all.   I’d also consider who you’re dressing for, like the other reply said. If you love what you wear obviously don’t do different because of something I say! But I felt a lot better about myself when I stopped trying to change my body type with clothes (which doesn’t mean I stopped wearing all of my more “flattering” pieces). But I actually found a lot more confidence dressing in clothes that are easier for us to pull off. For me, that’s 1920s and 1960s inspired dresses. The “sack” shape and drop waists are actually often really flattering on us (even with my short legs) and it’s unique because most people don’t find them flattering.   Yes, I probably look less traditionally sexy. But I’ve gotten lots of positive comments on the style that mean more to me anyway. I’ve gotten “Mad Men” comments so some people think it’s sexy anyway!   My advice is to step out of your comfort zone and try to find things that make you feel wonderful outside of people’s expectations of what your naked body should look like.   Good luck! I’m sure you look stunning.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:This - many people tend to compliment things that catch the eye or are a change from the norm. They may be noticing the item itself or the alteration (e.g., from long hair to short), but this doesn’t necessarily mean it works for you. (Also, with friends/family, they’re likely to compliment any changes to be nice, even if it’s not an improvement.)   I agree with OP’s stance of focusing on how you feel over how others react. I love jumpsuits, and lots of friends tease that I look like a mechanic in one I own, but I like it and wear it anyway. Similarly, I get a lot of compliments on a sleeveless dress that makes me feel like a frumpy MIL, and that dress has since been retired.	labels:	episode_done:True

People aren't going to lie (Compliments, especially unprompted are going to be genuine), but saliency is the key feature.	labels:> I'd say 75% of compliments are basically "I noticed this".   Exactly! It’s for this reason that (in most instances) I usually prefer people not notice my clothing enough to compliment any specific item.   As an example, I can wear a bright coral sweater and receive many compliments on it — but that’s because coral washes me out so badly that the sweater is all anyone notices. Or I can wear statement earrings. They’d utterly overwhelm my face, but I’d surely get comments and compliments.   A neutral grey sweater is a much less exciting item and is less likely to attract attention or compliments on its own — but I know that grey  makes my skin and eyes/hair pop in a way that make *me* look good as opposed to the clothing.
text:This is such a great way to describe it! I reminds me of the idea of you wearing the clothes vs the clothes wearing you, with the latter in my experience being true for whenever I wear a loud or fashionable piece that maybe isn't the best suited for me but might be really nice on its own.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Have you ever gotten tons of compliments on something but are still on the fence?	labels:People usually compliment clothes and items that stand out. It's usually not something that looks good, at least to ourselves.   I remember Karen from Karenbritchick, who often looks amazing in her clothes and designer items, talk about her most complimented item, and it's not the designer bags, cool clothes that she owns, but some wack, elaborate guitar strap for her bag.   So, our own gut feelings are important. Also, what looks good might not feel good.
text:I have an almost-completely sheer white jumpsuit with embroidered flowers on it that is super cute but when I wear it I feel like I’m wearing a clown suit. Wide legs, low crotch, etc. But inevitably when I wear it (with a super annoying bodysuit underneath because you can See Everything without it) it’s a total head turner, random people off the street tell me how much they like it, etc.   It’s a beautiful piece of clothing, but I’m self conscious and irritated by it when I wear it. Such a bummer!	labels:	episode_done:True

text:>I’d also pay attention to the content of the compliment.  This is so interesting, but this is kind of hard too, sometimes. I had thought that maybe the novelty of the color was the reason for most of the compliments, but I have had several people who know me well also tell me that they like the color because it looks like it is natural and not like I dyed it (which, I guess is true since it is the result of a botched lightening job and not actual dye?).  Then again, these people also told me for years that they liked my bangs ... maybe they're all just benevolent liars. Unfortunately my hairdresser quit during the pandemic due to having a vulnerable family member so there's no one now I trust to tell me the truth about my hair.	labels:Well, I think it’s also important to recognize that people have different tastes and preferences. Lord knows I would never let my husband, who I love dearly, choose my clothes.   It’s also possible to have multiple things be true simultaneously. The color is unusual, it looks natural on you *and also* it’s not what you wanted (I’m guessing, based on “botched lightening job”).  Hair color is tough because it doesn’t lend itself to the “well, I’ll keep it in the closet and see how often I actually wear it” compromise that most of us make with clothes that we’re iffy about. Unless you’re a big scarf person or like wigs, it’s kind of an either/or question.	episode_done:True

text:It's a lot weirder for someone, regardless of interest, sex, gender, etc. relative to the recipient of the compliment, to say "you look great in x" rather than "x is cool." The less potential implications behind a statement like that, the less it has room to be misinterpreted.	labels:Exactly.

text:I made this effort a couple years ago and it was life changing. It started with me silently observing and thinking nice things about people, but then it turned into me telling total strangers they look baller and it just brings so much joy into the world.

text:Have you ever gotten tons of compliments on something but are still on the fence?	labels:I've kept things like this a little longer due to people's compliments, or tried a little harder to sync them with my wardrobe in a way that I like better, but the vast majority of the time I end up donating or ceasing to wear the item in the end anyway.   Ultimately, aside from overarching situational appropriateness, other people's thoughts about my clothing choices (positive OR negative) have very little impact on my style and like you, my key motivator is my own comfort and confidence.	episode_done:True
text:Have you ever gotten tons of compliments on something but are still on the fence?	labels:Sometimes, I look really good in an item of clothing, but it doesn't feel like me.

Also Pinterest is great if you haven’t used it yet.	episode_done:True
text:Street style	labels:As opposed to when I’m at the office, I tend to wear a lot more like loose, slouchy, oversized tops/sweaters, shorter skirts (pleated/schoolgirl-ish ones especially), more printed t-shirts, more stretchy cotton dresses, and more large belts with chain or stud details. Stuff that feel a little too revealing or edgy or casual for work but that I still like.  Typical free time outfits for me would be a stretchy, short tight, or flared cotton dress dress, thick tights and a big cardigan, or a short pleated skirt with a camisole and an oversized, off-shoulder sweater, or a long is-it-a-shirt-or-is-it-a-dress and patterned leggings.	episode_done:True
text:Street style	labels:This winter I found a coat I fell in love with, wool, oversized, soft pink, it turns heads on its own so I just find different things already in my closet to wear with it.

text:Great idea!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do you decide what clothes you “need”?	labels:So what works for me is whenever I'm getting dressed and there's an item I wish I had to complete the outfit I mentally note it. Make sure to think of the category of item Ex Black Cargo pants, Brown hoodie w/ no drawstrings and no logo, white chunky sneakers. Etc.   Then as time goes by, the categories that come up over and over are the most important to grab first and would improve the most outfits. I add them to a list  If I'm shopping and I want something but it's not on my list then I try to pass on buying it. When a deal pops up and it's something on my list it's a no brainer instant purchase.   I try to be patient and wait for items that meet all my picky criteria. If I'm not in love with it I don't buy it. If even one thing is not right, I pass.   And final thing is I aim high whenever I buy for these categories in quality and spend time hunting. Ex: If I have $250 for a jacket I try and wait till a $600 jacket goes on sale for $250. You can find investment worthy designer for near regular retail prices and it's worth the extra money.	episode_done:True
text:How do you decide what clothes you “need”?	labels:Quality over quantity. ALWAYS. During this time, Christmas sales are so tempting, and I work in retail so it’s hard not to go into work and think ‘what can I buy today with my 50% staff discount, and the others sales going on at the mall?’  I always go in a shop with a minimalistic mindset, and while I’m no true minimalist with clothes, I hate clutter and excess. But I still love to experiment with fashion (I went to school for it, it’s hard not to be creative). Look in your wardrobe, watch YouTube or look at Instagram and have intention on what style of garment you want that will suit you. Also, have patience in finding the right one you will be happy to keep for a LONG time.	episode_done:True
text:How do you decide what clothes you “need”?	labels:I'm going to try and do a clothing no buy in 2021 (I can only replace athletic shoes) so take what I say with a grain of salt.  For me, it is a matter of knowing myself.  The current trends (the boxy, oversized, neutral aesthetic) do not work for my body type (pear).  The other trend that does not work for me is the cropped/ankle pants trend.  I look like a small child who just outgrew their clothes.  I also know what I do not wear (black or khaki pants--- reminds me of retail work uniforms of years past).  When I purchase something, (in my mind) it has to "pay for itself."  Meaning I have to think of at least x times that I will wear the item before I will buy it (special occasions are the rare exception).  X means the dollar amount.  So I have to wear a $30 sweater at least 30 times to make it worthwhile.	episode_done:True
text:How do you decide what clothes you “need”?	labels:When I go to grab a piece and I either don’t have it, or I’ve worn it out, or it no longer fits. But I also don’t keep stuff that doesn’t fit when I try it.  I feel too guilty and like I’m throwing hard earned money away otherwise.	episode_done:True
text:How do you decide what clothes you “need”?	labels:This is small but one piece of shopping advice I still use is, ‘will I wear this tonight?’ Obviously for many items that is not a literal question but I find if I say no that may not be the right item for me.  Helps me pass on things that are nice but not right for my personality or lifestyle. I actually learned a lot from Ines de la Fressange’s book Parisian Chic. It’s a very general style book, it’s less about her taste, which is great, and more about how to have a quality collection that fits you.	episode_done:True
text:How do you decide what clothes you “need”?	labels:In general, nobody needs clothes, but want clothes instead.  You wish you could get a subscription for your clothes and identify gaps etc etc. You can, just get a personaly stylist, they'll do that job for you.
text:I second this: I’ve bought too many clothes too many times to fit into a trend that doesn’t fit my style or body type.  Keep the clothes you’re comfortable with, donate what doesn’t fit/work for you anymore, and spend some time discovering your style identity before making any purchases.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do you decide what clothes you “need”?	labels:It starts with your personal style. If you don’t have one or you don’t know what it is, than your shopping habits will show that.   What I used to do was take photos of myself wearing the clothes I liked that I already owned, and when I’d shop, I’d try on clothes and see if they were fitting in a way that would both accommodate my style and also the other clothes. It helped me choose clothing that wouldn’t go weeks together in terms of length. I also used to take photos of my closet so I could avoid buying things I may have forgotten about.	episode_done:True
text:How do you decide what clothes you “need”?	labels:If you find yourself wearing a particular piece all the time, try and think what makes it a favorite, and what wardrobe home it fills. I’d then keep my eyes open for one or two similar pieces.   For example I bought a short sleeved button up on a whim and loved it, so now I have a bunch that I love and I wear all the time. They fill a good hole in my wardrobe (layers well under cardigans, fun print, work appropriate).	episode_done:True
text:How do you decide what clothes you “need”?	labels:I think once you have your basics down, pay attention to the kinds of things that you find yourself wishing you had when you're getting dressed or when you're out.  If you keep consistently wanting the same things, long term, then it makes sense to add it to your closet.  It also helps if you get super specific about what you want and don't pick up things that kinda work, since you'll just end up buying a ton of similar things.	episode_done:True
text:How do you decide what clothes you “need”?	labels:Have you done a styling session with your current wardrobe to put together looks? If so, how did that go? It sounds like there is a chance you could/may need to work in your closet a little to put together outfits if you have not already. This is also a great exercise to identify what you really have to work with, and what you need. That'll help you round out what's missing and make your wardrobe more workable.	episode_done:True
text:How to shop ThredUp and avoid the junk?	labels:I sort on ThredUp by particular brands or really specific items. Like my most successful shopping experience there was looking for a silk leopard-print button down shirt. It let me sort by shirts in my size, made of silk, and then I picked animal print for the color. I found so many good options that I bought three! If I don't have that kind of specific search or a particular brand I want to browse, I find it pretty hard to look through.	episode_done:True
text:How to shop ThredUp and avoid the junk?	labels:Big plus one on filtering! I have a saved search of my favorite brands in my sizes in new or like new condition that I check periodically and more targeted searches like “wool and cashmere sweaters from 3 brands I like” that I use more often. Size filtering and material filtering can be the most helpful, as can brand filtering. Setting up a brand filter can take the longest but a big saved search of brands you like can help a lot in browsing.  Also plus one on payout—payout percentage increases with the dollar value of the item, and it’s so much lower effort for me to sell through them than through Poshmark. Poshmark takes forever and you have to spend so much time putting together good photos, detailed descriptions, and offers to potential buyers (plus then there’s the whole expectation of making you package cute with tissue papers and whatever to get good reviews). My time is just worth more than the additional payout I get from them. Thredup also will donate and recycle items they can’t sell, which turns it into a one stop thing for me. I will take my higher end items elsewhere for a first look, but if my local high end consignment shop won’t take it, I’ll let Thredup have a pass at it. Love the convenience factor.	episode_done:True
text:How to shop ThredUp and avoid the junk?	labels:Personally I don't care that ThredUp gives me very little money because I see their clean out bags as an effortless way to give clothes I don't want a new purpose.

ThredUp either sells my clothes to a new owner or recycles them and maybe I even get a couple bucks out of it.

I generally stick to natural fibers, as polyester and rayon can be very hit or miss without feeling it. I don't buy anything with any damage. Thread up also has "premium" section but I find its kinda random what gets in there. You can also search by price >$10 and it will weed out a lot of junk.	episode_done:True
text:How to shop ThredUp and avoid the junk?	labels:Easiest way to sort out the crap - filter by fabric.   I always filter to only look at clothes with cotton/linen/silk/leather/wool. Sometimes low-quality blends pop up (Forever 21 makes clothes with like 2% cotton, which to me is just a waste), but in general you get better quality, more unique pieces.	episode_done:True
text:How to shop ThredUp and avoid the junk?	labels:As others have said, I think ThredUp is much better if you're going there with specific pieces or even just your favorite brands in mind. I have saved searches on my favorite brands that I know I can get for a great price there. That being said, I'm taking a break from ThredUp because I've had terrible experiences with the last 3 orders I made with them where I ended up returning almost all of it. They've been bad about listing something as "you might mistake it for brand new!" and then when it arrives there is definite fading that wasn't apparent in the photos, obvious lightening under the arms, pilling, etc. Very frustrating.

That’s what I can remember.
text:I have nothing to add except for the fact that as someone who graduated high school in 2013, yall were the BLUEPRINT. I have this (not exactly groundbreaking) theory that whatever the teenagers were wearing when you were a kid is influential to who you are as a person. Lizzie McGuire, Mean Girls, Paris Hilton were who I wanted to BE in the 2000s as a kid lol. Now as a 26 year old I'm reading these comments about girls who wore long silky camis and super low rise jeans to frat parties and honestly yall still somehow sound so cool to me (even though I already went through that phase wearing the mid-2010 crop tops + high waisted jeans trend)!	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Lessons from a Year of No New Clothes	labels:Your comment about thinking each new piece will “complete” your wardrobe is so spot-on - I’m the master of convincing myself that once I have a [insert item here], my clothing collection will be complete and I’ll never need anything again. Surprise, surprise - there’s literally always something new that I “need” to “finish off” my wardrobe.   Like you, I’m trying to learn to work with what I have and narrow down exactly what I feel best in. I like high-waisted everything, plain tops in neutral colors, subtly patterned pants, button-downs that don’t need too much ironing, and a variety of jackets and shoes to switch things up. (Which I already own in spades.)   For 2021, I’m hoping to curb any non-necessary shopping impulses and am creating a shortlist from which I cannot deviate (as there are a few items I still want to add, such as a camel coat and a ski bib).	episode_done:True
text:Lessons from a Year of No New Clothes	labels:I did a no-buy year and a low-buy 6 months after that in 2018. I'm probably going to do the same this year.   I started as I needed to spend as little as possible as I had a pet who cost a lot for an ongoing chronic illness before he died.  I think I became more selective about what I bought. I also unsubscribed from a whole lot of sites. I also  became much better at money management and making outfits work in different ways. Also, by the end if I didn't wear it, it was worth thinking about what didn't like about it so I wasn't tempted by something inappropriate in the future.   The only reason it ended was I changed jobs and lost significant weight. But now my new wardrobe is complete, I don't need anything in the forseeable future. I'm probably going to just go through clothes seasonally  and  make a list if I need anything.  I did this before my no buy year and it worked well, but I had a lot more than I needed. It should work better now as I'm comfortable with the amount.	episode_done:True
text:Lessons from a Year of No New Clothes	labels:Your post really resonated with me. First and foremost, hats off to you, for real. I definitely would not consider a no-buy during 2020 easy, at ALL. Yes maybe on a superficial level it would seem so since we are all just sitting around in onesies watching Netflix, but shopping - especially for new clothes - is an extremely effective way to self-soothe and lord knows we have needed a lot of that in 2020.   I personally broke up with fast fashion in 2019 during my second pregnancy (which really was easy in a way, because I didn’t actually fit into anything so it was difficult to justify purchasing new clothing). I’ve had a few weak moments but have discovered sewing/dressmaking. It is really exciting in its own right because, as you said, I actually have a personal style and a lot of my dream pieces are actually super attainable. It also just feels so good to finally be outside of the hamster wheel of endless trends, sales, promotions, influencers, newsletters, marketing and whatever else have you. Good luck in 2021!	episode_done:True
text:Lessons from a Year of No New Clothes	labels:Congrats! I did this in 2019 and I bought so much less in 2020 than I did in 2018. It's still really hard to resist buying clothing, but knowing I did it for a whole year without losing it does help.	episode_done:True
text:Lessons from a Year of No New Clothes	labels:I really like this and definitely also “sad shop” online. I like the idea of no new clothes for the year - especially since I have shirts from 2020 that have never been worn due to shelter in place.  Thanks for sharing!	episode_done:True
text:Lessons from a Year of No New Clothes	labels:That's amazing! Im soo similar and my 2021 resolution is to do this too, I buy wayy to much to make me feel better and I love buying clothes but I honestly know I dont need them. So roll on 2021 to finally create a style	episode_done:True
text:Lessons from a Year of No New Clothes	labels:\#3. really spoke to me. I used to be subscribed to a ton of clothing brand emails. I ended up shopping much more for things I didn't need because of FOMO. Now I'm pickier about which brands I get emails from.	episode_done:True

text:Lessons from a Year of No New Clothes	labels:With sales, I am working to remind myself that it is cheaper to buy nothing at all.  I have considered challenging myself to a no buy with one exception - I can make things. I love knitting and sewing and I’ve really enjoyed creating items to wear. However it is so easy to buy fabric for the same reasons you listed above. My goal is to be thoughtful in what I make, also focus on making things for other people. I can still fulfill that creative drive that way.	episode_done:True
text:Lessons from a Year of No New Clothes	labels:Love your post.  I recently-ish got a sewing machine and am making myself only wear stuff I make.  Sewing can be an expensive hobby, however, I feel the clothes I do make would be less expensive than what I'd buy because I tended to go for nicer brands or linen sellers on Etsy (which can cost a pretty penny).  So, overall, I'm spending less money, have a new fun hobby, and it also makes me be more intentional with what I make since I'm not the fastest sewist.  Edit: also, in addition to unsubscribing to sale emails like you mentioned, I also moved all my shopping favorites in my browser to another folder that was annoying to get to.  I didn't want to delete it in case I do need a new winter coat or something (and can't remember brands). But this has really helped my window-not-really-shopping.	episode_done:True
text:Advice needed: How to keep up with trends without social media?	labels:Your best bet is going old school and following blogs. Set up an RSS feed, find people you like, and follow fashion that way.   But this is also a good time for you to explore YOUR personal style, without the influence of... uh... influencers. Obviously some of the fun of fashion is finding out what the trends are as dictated by other people, but with a little freedom from those, you might create silhouettes and combinations that are far more interesting to you personally than whatever's popping off on IG this week.  You can also do what I do and set up an IG that's just for this kind of thing. I don't follow anyone I know, I don't post anything on there. It's just for me to keep up with fashion, some bands I like, and a few owls managed to sneak their way in there. If you set up something like that, you can set aside an hour on the weekend and get caught up on fashion stuff without even installing the app on your phone. A lot of influencers are on YouTube too, so if you'd prefer to stay away from IG altogether, you can just look for their YouTube pages and watch their content on the weekend.

text:How do I know I’m not being scammed?	labels:I think if you see the same clothes on Shein, then the boutique is not being honest about where the clothes are coming from. Someone on this sub linked a cute “handmade” smart watch band from a shop on Etsy. When I went to buy it, I found the exact same watch band on Amazon for $10 cheaper. It was clear the Etsy shop was just marking up a mass-produced item and claiming it was handmade. They even used the exact same pictures as the Amazon listing. When shops aren’t honest about that stuff, I have no qualms purchasing the exact same product somewhere cheaper.	episode_done:True
text:How do I know I’m not being scammed?	labels:Chances are, if you find the boutique selling the same things as everyone else is on Instagram, it’s dropshipped. You’ll have to look at reviewers (not anyone paid) to really know. I watch a bunch of Youtube videos and if not available, check reviewing sites.	episode_done:True
text:How do I know I’m not being scammed?	labels:I know that legitimate IG shops exist. But for me personally, any IG shop I've "discovered" has clearly been either a scam or uses drop-shipping. I simply refuse to shop on IG all together.  I really recommend thrifting and organizing clothing swaps with friends (if/when safe, of course!) and/or using online alternatives like Poshmark, as someone else suggested.	episode_done:True
text:How do I know I’m not being scammed?	labels:I don't trust boutiques on insta, they always seem to be fake low quality stuff. Generally you can plug the items name into a google search and see how many variations come up. Or use the same descriptors they do. Reverse image search on chrome works too.	episode_done:True
text:How do I know I’m not being scammed?	labels:Find actual boutiques in your town/nearby cities etc. Either use Google maps, try posting on reddit/facebook pages from those nearby towns or cities.  Then check if they have a website. I would expect the contact details to have their actual street address (verifiable on google maps and street view, or a drive past), contact details (call them up and ask some questions) and their refund policies etc.    Most of the actual boutiques I know of - their photos (Instagram especially) are all taken in store, in front of the store, or nearby. They typically use the staff working there or regular customers as models - you tend to see the same faces.	episode_done:True
text:How do I know I’m not being scammed?	labels:These are all pretty much dropshipping the same cheap clothes from Ali. Unfortunately affordable and ethical usually mutually exclusive because our idea of what cheap clothes should cost is based off a fast fashion model that can't work at a smaller sustainable scale. I would highly suggest the used market for affordable ethical clothes. threadup and poshmark are my go tos. But if you want to buy new Universal standard and Pact are good. Its also worth remembering that a lot of 'ethical' brands are really just greenwashed so who knows.	episode_done:True
text:How do I know I’m not being scammed?	labels:I haven't had a lot of success with boutiques found on ig - I have a hard time deciphering if they are drop shipping like you mentioned.   You could try Poshmark - I find it helpful when I'm looking for something specific. Other than "shopping your own closet", shopping secondhand is also thinking more ethical and sustainable. Plus, you can find styles you like at a fraction of the cost.	episode_done:True

text:Does change in climate = change in style?	labels:I moved from a tropical climate to a place with seasons and my style totally changed! Now I loveeee dressing up for colder weather (even though I hate the cold) and have neglected my summer style.  I think my style before was really based on the culture of where I lived - super beachy and low effort. Moving to a bigger city helped me develop my own style.	episode_done:True
text:Does change in climate = change in style?	labels:When I moved from a very seasonal American city to South East Asia, I for whatever reason thought that I _needed_ to live solely in very thin, very loose cottons and breezy skirts. I didn't bring a single pair of jeans or boots because I was fairly certain they would cause me to immediately melt into a puddle. For a period of time, I prioritized the heat over everything, so my style became really plain and blah, whereas I used to be fairly experimental back in the US.  Luckily, I then realized the key to dressing in the heat is just finding a balance. A thin turtleneck is fine with a skirt. Jeans and boots work fine with a tank top. Light weight blazer or loose oversized button-ups have replaced coats and sweaters, but still allow for some layering.   I've come to a good place with what I view my style as now, but I find that I do have to repeat a lot of basic "outfit formulas" and feel a bit envious of people who live in the cold and can layer to their hearts content. I think the cold weather lends itself to more creative combinations, whereas being stuck in perpetual summer makes me feel confined to a life of sun dresses.	episode_done:True
text:Does change in climate = change in style?	labels:I moved from a place which has four seasons but it often grey and overcast to a place just a little north of the tropics with a lot of heat and sun. I still favour similar shapes but now in much lighter fabrics. The biggest difference has been the amount of colour in my wardrobe. I’ve gone from a mainly navy and blacks colour palette to wearing such a variety. I find myself often wearing seasonal colours as if I’m trying to create seasons which simply don’t exists in the weather!	episode_done:True
text:Does change in climate = change in style?	labels:I think it did for me, however im trying to fix that. Id say my style in general is feminine/pretty and dressy. The weather in one location was mainly rainy, but also had alot of hills. So I ended up wearing jeans, a sweater/shirt and trainers for the majority of my duration there, unless I was going out. In that case, my style showed through more. Ive now moved back to my home country which has all seasons. During the summer, its hot so im normally in a feminine, flowy dress, but once winter hits, its just way too cold lol. Ill kind of go back to swearing jeans, a sweater and boots, but try to style it with more accessories (colorful scarf or a checkered jacket with some mid sized earrings). I bought a pair of knee high boots, a skirt and a couple thicker winter dresses this year to push myself to maintain my style whilst staying warm. We shall see if I stick to it, lol.	episode_done:True
text:Does change in climate = change in style?	labels:Moving to San Antonio encouraged me to explore my summer style! I'm into linens, rompers, light fabrics, and sleeveless/short sleeve button shirts. Its been a lot of fun. I used to rely on layering to complete my outfits. Now, I look at accessories (mostly earrings, scarves, and belts), textures, and shoes to tie everything together.	episode_done:True
text:Does change in climate = change in style?	labels:Where i live does not get extremely cold but you definitely have to change your clothing if you dont want to freeze to death.

I also almost exclusively wear my thigh high boots in winter/fall	episode_done:True
text:Does change in climate = change in style?	labels:I have lived in the pnw my whole life, and when my husband and I moved to cali we were shocked with how our style changed because it NEVER rained, and any rainproof clothing just became sweat too much clothing. Only breathable fabrics!!!	episode_done:True
text:Does change in climate = change in style?	labels:I moved from a place that was overcast and rainy most of the year where even the summers didn’t get warmer than 24C and the winters were around 10C to a place with hot (30C), humid summers, rainy and overcast late falls and cold (-10 to -30C) winters and where spring is so short it doesn’t count as a season. Boy has my wardrobe changed. I wear dresses, baggy pants and shorts in summer, the stuff I wore all year (jeans, t-shirts, sweaters, light rainwear) in the former place now works for fall. I wear layers of Heattech and down in winter and very rarely leave the house in a dress and only then if I’m going by car. Uniqlo has replaced Lululemon as my favourite place for basics. Since I walk and take public transit all year round and my outerwear is what most people see me in during the winter, I’ve got a closet full of winter coats and winter boots. It’s taken nearly a decade but I’m ready for every possible occasion and temperature and every storm.	episode_done:True

text:What’s some of the best general advice you’d give to someone new to female fashion?	labels:Don't try too hard to fit into a style box or get too rigid about style rules. Be very honest with yourself about how something makes you feel as much as how it makes you look- and remember that being comfortable and confident makes literally any look 1000x better.  And for less woo woo advice- type of fabric makes a huge difference, the cheaper stuff usually isn't worth it. That's probably applicable to a lot more than women's clothes though.	episode_done:True
text:What’s some of the best general advice you’d give to someone new to female fashion?	labels:Keeping proportions in mind has been helpful for me (I am long-waisted relative to my height). Also, I have found the phrase "just flattering enough" to be helpful. An outfit doesn't need to be perfect for you to enjoy wearing it.
text:I would add that finding a great tailor can help you bridge the gap from “flattering enough” to “WOW”! Trying to find the perfect fit off the rack can be impossible.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What’s some of the best general advice you’d give to someone new to female fashion?	labels:Honestly I think the best rules are the ones you come up with for yourself that suit you body best. Like for me, I only wear skirts or pants that are fitted to my waist, and my thighs are large(r) so I prefer straight cut jeans to skinny jeans to hide them. I think most people would come up with rules like “never wear 2 different plaids/ prints/ etc in one outfit!” But I do all the time because it’s fun for me	episode_done:True
text:What’s some of the best general advice you’d give to someone new to female fashion?	labels:- Above all wear what makes you happiest   - Many women feel the best when dressing to their body type (apple, triangle, etc)  - Many women also feel best when dressing in their colors (autumn, spring, etc)	episode_done:True

text:What’s some of the best general advice you’d give to someone new to female fashion?	labels:I would say start looking into what specific fabrics do and how to clean and treat them. You can invest quite a lot in a good cashmere sweater, but if you don’t wash it properly no amount of money will safe it. Same goes for a skirt from a fast fashion retailer, is it worth the x amount of money if it is made from an acrylic fabric? Wouldn’t you rather pay less at a budget retailer for the same quality?	episode_done:True
text:What’s some of the best general advice you’d give to someone new to female fashion?	labels:Lots of good advice here already. One thing maybe worth adding: be aware that a lot of women's retailers use soft-feeling but lower quality fabric. At places like Zara and H&M, the men's clothes will be made of nice cotton or wool blends, and then nearly identical garments in the women's section will be flimsy rayon blends (knitwear, especially). It's easy to get duped by something that feels nice in the shop, until you get home and realise it's made of nasty sweaty acrylic. The stitching and construction can also be shoddier, so you'll end up with garments that look warped and awkward after one wash. (My husband is often shocked by the difference in quality when we shop together.) Maybe you've already noticed this, but I wish someone had told me these things when I started shopping for myself :)  Another thing to know is a lot of women's clothes are labeled "dry clean only" or "hand wash only." You'll want to carefully read the labels so you don't ruin anything! The tumble dryer is not your friend, except for socks/undies/workout clothes. That said, most "dry clean only" items that aren't heavily embellished can be gently hand washed and air dried, but if you don't want the hassle, check the label before you buy.	episode_done:True
text:What’s some of the best general advice you’d give to someone new to female fashion?	labels:Don’t jump on trends...everything falls in and out of fashion if you wait long enough. Find a store/brand that you like the fit and cut of clothes on you and try to build a capsule wardrobe. Once you see what you like, you achieve a timeless look that doesn’t look trendy or dated. From there, feel free to incorporate fun pieces that can be easily added to other outfits like accessories or shoes.	episode_done:True
text:What’s some of the best general advice you’d give to someone new to female fashion?	labels:Honestly, accept that you’re gonna walk out the door and realize that your outfit looks ridiculous sometimes.  And that’s ok, especially when youre experimenting with new looks. As long as you liked the look before you stepped out the door and you figure out what you dont like about, it’s good!	episode_done:True
text:What’s some of the best general advice you’d give to someone new to female fashion?	labels:As other users mentioned, (in my friend group at least) women tend to focus on emphasizing and downplaying certain features to achieve a desired silhouette more than the men do.  \[\[I could go on a 2 bazillion word rant about societal pressures for beauty standards but nobody wants to read that. \]\]   Point being, my advice would be to really look at the way clothes fit your body in almost an abstract way and see if you're achieving the shape you're trying to create.   This is 2021 you can be anything you want! a series of cascading triangles?  asymmetrical amoeba?  soft flappy machine at the car wash? sharp and pointy with a squishy interior? go for it!  If you're already into alternative / goth you probably have a good idea of your style already! :) Now it's just time to decide how "girly" you want to be with it. My goth "uniform" consists mostly of a mini skirt, crop top or top tied into a knot, black tights and boots. When it gets too hot for boots switch to studded sandals or converse and take off the tights.  If it's too cold put thigh high socks over the tights. Can't go wrong with a leather moto jacket or black faux fur on top.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else use a “formula” to create their outfits?	labels:I generally find its easier to base your outfits around one piece, often an accent piece or statement piece. I got the idea from storytelling/art composition seminars, its infinitely more easy to come up with a composition once you know what your main character is interacting with scene/item wise. The same applies to outfits, once you have your main piece for that outfit you can decide how casual/dressed up you want to be, whether you need to add more textures, and what colors will match with said pieces color.  Generally I stick to the rules of trying to match the metals/detailing of outfits, trying to either go with neutrals for primary pieces with skintone matches to accents, or going with monochrome outfits(which generally look very stylish automatically). Fit wise, I generally make sure that I alternate between loose up top/form fitting below the waist, or vice versa. Silhouette is the most important thing, I try to go for clean lines.  Pattern wise I limit them to one pattern max, the same goes for textured pieces.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else use a “formula” to create their outfits?	labels:I don't have a system per se. Rather, I have a kind of "capsule" mindset for my wardrobe: not too many statement pieces, and everything in my color palette (black, grey, Ivory, Navy, taupe, blush). I honestly haven't had to think about an outfit in years (outside of accounting for the weather). I can pick up practically any blouse, trousers, jacket, and accessory and they are almost guaranteed to match. I do find myself gravitating to layers (sweater over a blouse, cardigan over a top, etc) but I'm not too specific about it and I usually just choose whatever sounds most comfortable.  It works so well that I started doing this with lingerie too -only buying my lingerie in black, blush, or nude. Now my underwear always matches and it gives me the strength of ten men.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else use a “formula” to create their outfits?	labels:My aunt has a "1 of 3" rule that I like: only one of the following areas should be shown/highlighted, cleavage, legs or back. For example, if the top is revealing cleavage, no short skirt or backless top. If the skirt is short, no cleavage or back, and so on. She says "one is attractive, two becomes trashy".	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else use a “formula” to create their outfits?	labels:i kinda just got with what i know works for me. prioritize colors that make me happy, cuts that make me happy, things that fit right no matter what size it says it is, and comfortable fabrics so i don’t have a sensory issue with irritation.   so i guess my formula is more does this feel right to my needs and less “does this feel like a conventionally good looking outfit”	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else use a “formula” to create their outfits?	labels:I'm a Sagittarius with a Taurus moon, so my formula is just abject chaos but make it luxe (ie. I wear a flat gold herringbone chain, gold or tortoiseshell earrings, a little gold watch, and a gold signet ring + my engagement ring at all times, even if I'm wearing leggings and a sweatshirt to play Stardew Valley all day).   More seriously, my jewellery basically never changes (see above), so I guess that's my formula? I wear that combo whether I'm wearing a dress and heels to go out (in theory, who even remembers going out?) or jeans and a sweatshirt to go to the grocery store (in theory, we just do pick up orders now). I did just get a new big-girl job, so maybe this will change as I'm able to better afford the wild 1940s wardrobe of my dreams?	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else use a “formula” to create their outfits?	labels:When I was younger and experimenting with fashion and style, anything goes. Some days I hit bingo and come out looking fab, and other days I walk around knowing that I was a fashion disaster (incomplete outfits, too much going on,  non-cohesive outfits).  You know what? Everything is fine and the world keeps spinning.  I’ve since accumulated enough experience styling myself that those fashion disaster days are less and less. I just learned how to dress myself to my own satisfaction, efficiently. And this requires experience, experimentation, and learning.. from my good outfit days and my bad outfit days.  There really aren’t rules to fashion; what is a faux pas on someone, might be something you can pull off. It all depends on your style, personality, context.. so many factors.  I think this is how I would like to answer your question: what is the goal of a formula even? Where is this fear of failing an outfit coming from? Nobody really cares if your outfit is one necklace and a watch away from complete, or if you’re wearing one too many colors.  There are good and bad outfits, (or should I say outfits you like and outfits you don’t like), but it doesn’t mean the latter has no or negative value in your fashion journey. Don’t be afraid of making fashion mistakes! Cos unlike most mistakes in life, there aren’t really big consequences to it, and frankly nobody cares.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else use a “formula” to create their outfits?	labels:As a maximalist, I just mix whatever colours, textures and patterns resonate with me. I don't love super strict rules about how many colours we should wear or whatever. More is more and fashion should be fun and have a sense of humour. I especially like making references to particular vibes (e.g. Latin American drug lords with colourful print shirts and gold chains, but really exaggerate it and make it more fashion-y).  Obviously, not everyone feels the same way. You do you.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else use a “formula” to create their outfits?	labels:Some of mine in no particular order; I don't think about it all the time but my dressing habits are based around this:   * No more than 3 colours (I don't wear much black and have a lot of different neutrals, so I have to be aware of this). * Try to have something more interesting than just a crew neck sweater + pants. I am so guilty of falling into this when I get lazy.  * Don't wear the same colour pants and coat. People can probably pull this off no problem but it is something I avoid for some reason.  * Like someone else said, for tops and bottoms no tight/tight or loose/loose. I just don't feel comfortable that way. I feel better when I emphasize either my waist or my hips.  * Only wear 1 uncomfortable item at a time. Ideally you would have no uncomfortable items but unfortunately I have a few pieces that I am not willing to get rid of. If I wear them all at once it's like I am crawling in my own skin, so I try to be aware of this when I dress to leave the house.	episode_done:True

text:My 10x10 Capsule wardrobe challenge results	labels:I’ve never tried the challenge myself so it’s cool when others do and share their results.  I think outfit #9 works best because of the colours (green and white are dispersed well visually on top and bottom), the fabric weight matches for the top and bottom, and the contrast in size/busy-ness of the patterns.  I think #2 is my least favourite because it looks like you’re kinda divided into 3 harsh segments (black / blue / black). Maybe if you had something blue on top it could help integrate the outfit better? Like maybe a blue necklace or scarf or some other accessory with some blue.	episode_done:True

text:Alexander Wang accused of a history of sexual harassment - fashion in a year of reckoning?	labels:I thought this was old news but it seems to have been buried enough that it's just getting widespread attention now. I learned about it when the video of him dancing to WAP came out. I used to think that certain industries were rife for this sort of thing, but after a career change from arts to STEM I've realized they're all as bad as each other, albeit each with their own twist.   That said - I think fashion and other arts industries (looking at you, publishing) suffer from the issue of having just enough white women and white gay male representation to pat themselves on the back with the energy of a perpetual motion machine and drown out any and all criticism about diversity and representation, regardless of how genuine it may be. And when white people are concentrated at the top of the power hierarchy, it makes intersectional issues that much harder to surface with clarity.   For every person who has been harassed by AW, how many powerful white industry gatekeepers have brushed it off because they think only straight white men can be harassers? (And, of course, when a straight white man turns out to be an abuser they still can't accept it because "he's one of the good ones" or "he just made a mistake one time, it's not fair to ruin his life").  This only starts to get fixed when the industry gives equal respect and attention to the voices of everyone who helps to create it - whether they are a celebrated designer, fashion editor, personal assistant, early career model - anyone. I have plenty of reservations about social media, but the democratizing effect of reaching a huge audience without being beholden to the industry gatekeepers has been a very good thing for issues like these.	episode_done:True

text:Alexander Wang accused of a history of sexual harassment - fashion in a year of reckoning?	labels:I work in fashion and feel that the rage and “do the right thing” mentality only lasts as long as everyone sticks together (during a moment like #metoo or the protests after the murder of George Floyd.) A lot of people working in fashion are on a gig-by-gig basis so it’s Everyman for himself as far as success goes. People will turn a blind eye to the wrong doings of companies if it means that they themselves can get another paycheck or take a step up the ladder. It’s not that they themselves are immoral but it’s a hard industry to make it in and you can feel powerless when you’re not at the top. When you are on your own, which is most days, you will lose sight of the bigger picture of an ideal future.  For example this summer I read that FreePeople implemented racist practices within their stores. I added them to a list of companies that I didn’t want to work for (I’m freelance.) A month ago I was offered an opportunity to work with them and even though on principal I didn’t want to, I still considered it because I need a paycheck and the name would be good for me to have on my resume and would lead to more work.  Until their are unions to protect freelancers the fashion industry will remain corrupt. Everyone is afraid of being blacklisted and/or broke.

text:Pros and cons of an a capsule wardrobe?	labels:Disclaimer-- I know myself well enough to know that a capsule wardrobe is not for me.  When I get back from traveling, I cannot wait to wear different clothes.  Consider your laundry situation.  Having a smaller wardrobe means that you will be doing laundry more often.  If you're one in a family of 6, it may not be a big deal.  But for a single apartment dweller (pay per load), the additional costs can add up quickly.   Because I pay per load, I make sure that I maximize the capacity and only wash full loads (I'm paying the same no matter the capacity).  I am not one to hand-wash clothes in a bathroom sink.  Not now, not ever!   I do laundry roughly every other week alternating lights and darks.  (Sheets and towels are their own ballgame, and I will sometimes throw things in with them.)

Sounds really interesting!	labels:I personally started using an app (closet for android) where you put in every item of clothing you own, and log each day what you wear, so you KNOW how many wears your getting out of each item. Logging every item was weirdly fun, and really made me asses why I kept what I kept. But the app was a bit clumsy, so I made a secret instagram account to just take an Ootd (outfit of the day) picture as I headed out the door (or when covid hit, on my way to the couch, ha ha)   If you have apple I have heard great things about their apps, some people on here use airtable (if you search the group there are loads of better informed wardrobe tracking, and mgetsdressed blog has many many posts about it)   I personally found looking at what I'm ACTUALLY wearing, not what I aspire to wear, helps me be realistic about what to add to my wardrobe, and being more aware of everything I own now I've done several purges makes me pull out lesser worn items to I have an excuse to keep them	episode_done:True

text:Pros and cons of an a capsule wardrobe?	labels:i don’t have a strictly capsule wardrobe, but the colors i feel best in are pretty neutral, so i stick to those. black, white, grey, shades of green, navy, some tan/brown. most of these colors go with each other.   in high school and my early college years, i was much more experimental with my style. now i know what i feel good in, and i know i don’t have an unlimited budget, so i try to buy pieces that will go with most of my other clothes. i think there’s a financial benefit to this (getting lots of ‘wears’ per purchase). it also makes putting outfits together faster and easier.   i still buy “fun” pieces and mix them in, but my higher priced items need to be able to go with most of my other clothes.	episode_done:True
text:Pros and cons of an a capsule wardrobe?	labels:I wouldn’t call what I have a capsule wardrobe but I have a wardrobe of about 50-70 pieces including all my winter and summer wear. Everything I own are neutrals and warm toned. I have a warm complexion and cool tones just don’t look the best on me. I like to get things in various cuts and styles so that I can play with shapes and proportions in my outfits.   For example I have 7 pairs of pants which includes 4 pairs of jeans. 1 light wash in a straight leg, one medium wash in a wide leg, one black straight leg and one black slim cut. I also have a pair of wide leg black trousers, a pair of wide leg beige trousers and a pair of cream cargos. I don’t double up on cuts and styles so that I still have lots of options and not a wardrobe full of the same things.   My tops are mainly tanks and t shirts in black and white, a few button ups, and turtle necks and sweaters for the fall and winter.   I do have quite a few jackets, about 10-15 so that i still feel like I have options and not get bored. Coats and jackets are my favourite layering piece and really helps to make each outfit look different. I have a white cropped jacket, a black cropped jacket, a white flowy shirt jacket, a forest green shirt jacket, a tan blazer, black blazer, plaid cropped blazer, black wool shirt jacket, black leather blazer, beige trench coat, camel wool coat and a black puffer.   I make sure that everything goes together in terms of colours and undertones so that I can pull anything out in my wardrobe and know that it matches. I also don’t get bored because I put thought into making each piece different enough to still have plenty of looks/options while not having a massive wardrobe. I don’t have the most minimal wardrobe like those 30 item capsules but it works for me :)
text:I'd say this is a pretty successful capsule wardrobe! Most of the 30 piece ones I've seen have been by extreme minimalists or only work for the warmer months.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Pros and cons of an a capsule wardrobe?	labels:Capsule wardrobe is not for me. But you need to ask yourself what you want to get out of a capsule and what wardrobe issue you are trying to solve.   Do you want to have less stuff? Make it easier to get dressed? Get more higher quality stuff?  Eliminate decision fatigue? Etc.   If you are moving into to this path you want to figure out two things. Your color palette and what shapes you like. These should help you figure out the base of the wardrobe. And you do not want to trash everything and get it all at once. You’ll make mistakes and learn what you like by experimenting.    Maybe try a 10x10 challenge to get a taste of a more limited wardrobe.	episode_done:True

text:Pros and cons of an a capsule wardrobe?	labels:I have what would pretty loosely be defined as a capsule wardrobe -- everything is in a limited palate, and goes together. I love it, and don't plan on switching any time soon -- but I don't super-strictly limit the number of pieces I have either, which gets me out of the "Ugh, I hate all of this and I'm sick of it!" rut. While I've got a lot of strong investment-piece basics, there's a generous sprinkling of new (well, new-used) stuff coming in and out often enough that I don't get bored. Also, I don't stick just to neutrals; two of my four colors are green and purple.   I love that setting limits on myself has curbed my shopping addiction. I love that I'm pushed to be creative with what I have and think more carefully about how what I buy goes with what I have. I feel like I'm being true-er to my aesthetic because I'm not letting my head get turned by clothing that is objectively completely gorgeous but isn't for me for style/color/age reasons. And I love feeling put-together more often than I did when I didn't have limits.	episode_done:True
text:Pros and cons of an a capsule wardrobe?	labels:I've been using a capsule wardrobe of about 30 ish pieces since March so I have some pros and cons to contribute!   Pro: I wear more "out there" outfits. I know its counterintuitive to most people's neutrals capsule, but I put away every piece of black clothing I own and chose lots of color for my capsule and I've been having so much fun with it! Since I took the time to pick colors intentionally, I know when I'm picking outfits that my yellow plaid pants actually do go with almost all my shirts, and therefore I wear the fun pieces I love more often!  Con: I can't go out and buy new clothes when I come across an inspiration photo on Pinterest or instagram or whatever that I want to recreate. There's some clothes that I know won't look good with the majority of my closet, whether because of silhouette or color, so I can't justify buying them (I'm looking at you, wide leg flair pants).  Overall I've loved my capsule and I'm keeping it up for now!	episode_done:True
text:2020 Christmas Gifts Thread	labels:My husband got me a necklace. It’s one of those circle charms with writing on it. It says “I love you and I like you”. It’s a quote from parks and rec. it’s absolutely perfect and I haven’t taken it off since Christmas morning. I’ve always liked those small circle charms with writing on them, but I wasn’t sure which would be right for me and also sort of wanted it to be given to me by someone so it really meant something. I’ve never told anyone that. He chose this totally on his own; which makes it even more perfect.   I also got some great lounge wear, pants and shorts.   We also got each other the same cat headphones (though they won’t work for his computer). It worked out though since the ones he got for me hadn’t been shipped he was able to cancel and get a refund and I keep the ones meant for him.	episode_done:True

text:What is your ideal first date outfit?	labels:I always keep dates 1-2 fairly casual and do drinks or drinks and dinner since I wouldn't want to be trapped on an elaborate date if we're not vibing.   Summer: Sundress, denim jacket, white canvas sneakers if very casual place, sandals if slightly nicer.  Winter: Dark or black skinny jeans, cute top/sweater OR satin cami if I am feeling good about the date, booties. Coat depends on the weather. I try to keep it cute but sometimes giant puffy coat is the only reasonable option.

text:What is your ideal first date outfit?	labels:It depends on where you’re going, but I’ve never gone anywhere fancy for a first date. It’s either a walk in the park and ice cream, or maybe a movie.

text:What is your ideal first date outfit?	labels:Pre-COVID, my first dates were all super casual get a drink at the bar deals. I also work in theater so generally I was coming from work on a Friday or Saturday night so I really did need to do the “day to night” transformation you always used to see in magazines. So my usual outfit was a variant on black skinny jeans, low-cut tank top/slim fit band shirt (I date a lot of punk guys, go figure), with maybe a thin drapey waterfall sweater and/or leather moto jacket, and black combat boots. I’d add some more dramatic lipstick (bright red was a go-to but also brown, orange, purple) + big earrings at work and be good to go.	episode_done:True
text:What is your ideal first date outfit?	labels:I dress on a date how I dress day-to-day, which is pretty casual, lots of natural fabrics, usually wearing running shoes or some other form of sneaker (Blundstone boot in winter).  So for a first date I might wear a pullover sweater or silk blouse, blue jeans, and my least grungy sneakers. I probably wouldn't wear makeup besides clear brow gel and a tinted lip balm (I like the Burt's Bees ones), but I would take the time to make sure my hair looks on point.  I guess if it's warm (like above 25C/75F) I'd wear jacquard shorts and a linen or silk t-shirt. Or a dress, but I don't usually wear dresses so I might feel awkward in one.  Comfort above all because I find that translates to feeling good about myself (no matter how the date goes).	episode_done:True
text:What is your ideal first date outfit?	labels:Back when I did online dating and went on lots of first dates, I tended to keep it super casual and then just have one really flashy thing. Like jeans, sneakers, solid T-shirt, and flashy chandelier earrings. Or skip earrings and wear sequin shorts instead of jeans. If they wanted to go somewhere fancy, I just always talked them down into my comfort zone (i.e. a bar where all the staff know me, at least by sight) and will try to keep me safe if I need it.

text:What is your ideal first date outfit?	labels:Man, I had this short, lacy white dress I wore for YEARS. It was just a babydoll dress from UO or something, pretty casual, but it looked killer on me. In the winter, I’d wear tights and boots (and a coat, of course); in the summer nice sandals or sneakers depending on my mood. Sometimes I’d add a long necklace, sometimes just super simple earrings. It worked every time, my magic dress. It got lost in a move, but the move was cross-country with my bf with whom I have a dog, so I think the dress did its job.	episode_done:True
text:What is your ideal first date outfit?	labels:I prefer getting drinks for a first date. I think having a dinner date is too formal/too much of a (time) commitment when I’m just trying to get to know a person and feel each other out. It’s easier to dip out after a drink and there is less financial involvement.   Usually I wear a pair of statement earrings and one other statement piece (can be anything: jacket, top, etc). The rest I keep pretty basic (aka the rest of my outfit is black).   I wear a lot of black generally, so on a first date, I want to wear something that is representative of what I wear on day-to-day.	episode_done:True

He still talks about that dress and can describe it in detail.  It’s not about what you wear. Men don’t care about that. But DO always wear something you feel great about yourself in! I’d say business casual is a good baseline for a first date.	episode_done:True
text:What is your ideal first date outfit?	labels:I have completely given up on dating after my divorce, but when I did try, I kept things pretty casual.  I don’t want to portray myself as someone I’m not, so I would keep things pretty casual with jeans, a nice top or tee, whatever jacket went with my weather/my outfit and, depending on my mood, either Birkenstocks, converse or a pair of fun printed flats. I tend to take my more casual style and dress it up with fun and unique jewelry.	episode_done:True

Get a large salad spinner and some gentle lingerie soap, put your really delicate stuff in with some warm water and detergent, spin a hand-full of times and let it soak for 5 mins, drain the water out and fill it with cold water, let it soak for 5, then spin, drain, refill, spin drain repeat till it comes out clear. Takes maybe 15 mins total and you don't destroy your clothing. You can even spin it again once the water is out to speed up drying if you let it air dry.

text:I handwash all the time--the salad spinner is a great idea!  Most of the clothes that I handwash call for cold water only though, so I never use any warm water.  As for detergent, I use Woolite.  Threads are more delicate when wet, so I avoid any rough wringing--I roll them up in towels to get most of the water out.  With knit sweaters etc, I let them dry laying down, put back in their shape, as they get very heavy with water and hanging could cause them to lose their shape.  Since I already have many pieces that I handwash, I just end up doing that with all of the pieces I care about/really want to last and it works great albeit a bit time consuming!	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Hand wash only clothes	labels:Depends on the fabric. Wool and silk? You bet that, given their price, I am not putting them into a machine, as I want to have the full control that handwashing provides. Same for my all-time favourite clothes that I couldn't bear to lose. Anything else that says handwashing? Put that in a delicates bag and pop it into the machine and done :)	episode_done:True
text:Hand wash only clothes	labels:I think that this really depends on what type of washing machine you have access to. If you have a modern, front loading machine, with multiple wash settings, you can relatively easily machine wash many “hand wash only” items. I’ve had varying results with top loaders or old front loading washers-I find them more rough on clothes. Most items do ok on a delicates cycle with cold water for both stages. I often wash sweaters on the wool setting (cold water, low spin) or soak my sweaters with euclean and spin dry-er in the machine before laying flat to dry. Most of the damage to clothes happens in the dryer IMO. Also, brands often put dry clean only or hand wash only because they haven’t tested the fabric for machine wash and want plausible deniability-thus many things can survive with machine wash cold and air dry. But your results may naturally vary based on the piece of clothing. I personally only buy stuff that I feel is very special that is not machine wash air dry safe. Otherwise I feel like laundry ends up taking too much of my life, and it isn’t worth it to me.
text:This. Every front loader I've ever used has had a hand wash cycle which just gently rocks the clothes in water and doesn't spin them.  I don't hand wash anything other than my face cloths and masks (simply because it's quicker).	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Hand wash only clothes	labels:I buy a lot of clothes with special washing instructions.  To me, "hand wash only" usually means "put in in the washer on cold and gentle cycle and hang to dry."   Exceptions: anything made of wool or silk must be washed in the bathtub by hand with The Laundress Wool and Cashmere Shampoo instead of detergent. This is what I do for anything labelled "dry clean only" as well.  Leather is the only thing I do not wash either in the gentle cycle or the bathtub.

Also, brands often put dry clean only or hand wash only because they haven’t tested the fabric for machine wash and want plausible deniability-thus many things can survive with machine wash cold and air dry. But your results may naturally vary based on the piece of clothing. I personally only buy stuff that I feel is very special that is not machine wash air dry safe. Otherwise I feel like laundry ends up taking too much of my life, and it isn’t worth it to me.
text:Yeah I live in an apartment with a laundry room (top loading) and I think the machines are a little hard on my clothes	labels:I have a top loader and throw my items in mesh delicates bags to keep them from getting stretched out too much during the delicate cycle.  No problems with anything except silk.  The spin dry cycle is too harsh for silk, IME.	episode_done:True
text:Hand wash only clothes	labels:I'm a knitter so I'm used to handwashing knit accessories. I have plastic containers and use Eucalan to soak, towels to gently roll and press the water out. For sweaters, I second everything else who just puts things in the gentle cycle and dries flat.	episode_done:True
text:Hand wash only clothes	labels:So far I've done pretty well just putting my things in mesh laundry bags and washing them on the delicate cycle in the machine, then air drying them.  That being said, we have a machine that was chosen specifically because it had a very good delicate cycle, and most of my pieces weren't terribly expensive to begin with. The tag may say hand wash only, but I'm not too worried about polyester.  For things I really really love and for my bras, I do actually hand wash them, and I'd probably do the same if I were to make a really expensive purchase or if I were handling an extra delicate fabric.	episode_done:True

Maybe a continuation of that trend, plus your idea of matching sets. beyond jewelry, i think it will stretch to all accessories. matching masks and scrunchies, matching jewelry, matching hats and scarves as we roll through winter.	episode_done:True

text:Your 2021 trend predictions?	labels:The style of 2020 was so much more feminine and romantic than the trends of the previous couple decades, so it'll be interesting to see how this rediscovery of feminine softness will influence things going forwards. As others have said I think there will be more focus on beautiful and dainty ornamentation paired with simpler slightly more fitted garments of natural fibre. Pants and skirts sitting on the hips bones rather than being high waisted. Floral and nature inspired patterns and jewellery, I'm thinking the painting of Ophelia by Millais. But maybe at the same time there will be a swing away from this sweet, innocent look with more psychedelic, rave culture, lsd and 1960s art nouveau appropriation poster aesthetics emerging. I think this kind of psychedelic combination of delicate "nature goddess" looks with more vivid colours, trippy prints and interesting details will start to emerge.  Honestly I'm hoping some of the slow fashion, "timeless", ethical (and expensive) clothing that has been cool for the last 5 years will finally start to mean that people actually do buy less stuff and the fast fashion cycle will slow down with changes being more in the realm of accessories and hair than in buying tonnes of clothing itself.... But probably not right...   On another note: nike AF1s (and vejas) are surely done by now, and maybe this is wishful thinking but I feel the cool sneaker trend cycle might fizzle out a bit, with more trad leather and cute heels and basic canvas shoes coming in... Anyone here got speculation on what the new cool shoe will be?

text:Shitpost Saturday: Grandma's Gift	labels:So it was actually my mom this time around. I'm old enough to be a g'ma myself so I figure Mom gets a pass.  I was chatting with some friends a few days ago about that stupid "We try to explain the 1979 Sears Wish Book to a millenial" article and for some reason I uttered (well, typed) the words "I miss velour". Well, I opened the Big Box O Stuff From Mom, and what should be in there but.... a velour zip-up cardigan. In a hideous print. With a zipper pull that's meant to look like metal but is obviously plastic (wouldn't have been surprised if it had come off in my hand). Did I mention the hideous print is BLUE? I don't even like blue.  But on the other hand.... it's SO WARM. And unlike most of the gifts of my childhood, it FITS PERFECTLY. It's not too big, not too tight, and somehow not a million miles too long.  Velour, though. I don't even know where the hell she finds these things.  I'll wear it over the festive Minnie and Mickey sweatshirt she got me last year. God knows what I'll wear under that as the sweatshirt is basically transparent. Hopefully I won't have to get up during the call because all that fits my lower half right now is sweatpants.	episode_done:True

text:What are your tips for dressing a big chest!	labels:My chest isn’t massive, but I have had some fit issues with clothes before, where the shirt is really tight around the chest but way too loose at the waist. Never a good look. My best tip for that is to buy shirts in a larger size that fits your chest, then tailor in at the waist. It’s relatively simple so you can learn to do it yourself and save lots of tailoring costs!	episode_done:True
text:What are your tips for dressing a big chest!	labels:I always thought the clean minimalist look was due to colour. I usually wear black and white, or tan.

text:What are your tips for dressing a big chest!	labels:As someone in a similar position, I avoid collars that are super high necked or super low. When I worked as a host and had to wear a lot of blouses I wore ones that were a size or two up (mostly to avoid button holes popping open) that could be styled in a French tuck with a tighter jean or pant. Similarly I’ll pair a tighter legging with a loose sweater or sweatshirt, so it’s not entirely frumpy but I’m not wearing something super tight across my chest. Lately I’ve been enjoying layering a nicer fitting cardigan or flannel over a half turtleneck, which doesn’t feel as oversized but the layering also takes some of the focus away from my breasts. When I don’t want to wear a tight pant I’ll wear high waisted sweats or joggers with a looser crop top, so even though it’s all loose comfy clothing it doesn’t feel as frumpy. For dresses I favor ones that are just a little loose but also come in around my waist, so there’s a bit of an hourglass shape to help seem proportional, but again it isn’t super tight.	episode_done:True
text:What are your tips for dressing a big chest!	labels:I like small knit sweaters and definitely avoid chunky knits. I like dress shirts too but I always have to pin them up to stop the gap between buttons. And more eye-catching bottoms so that gets more attention	episode_done:True

text:What are your tips for dressing a big chest!	labels:This may not be quite the type of answer you’re looking for, but have you considered trying out a minimizer bra? I just bought one a couple weeks ago because, like you, I’m a fan of clean lines and I want to wear certain things that tend to be most flattering on people with smaller chests. Shift dresses always make me look super overweight/shapeless because they don’t fall right on me, but a minimizer bra can help the dress lay a little flatter. They also reduce/eliminate that dreaded gap when wearing a button-up shirt, and I find that they help me to look less....Pamela Anderson-y when wearing tight fitting tops.	episode_done:True
text:What are your tips for dressing a big chest!	labels:I have big boobs and I love turtlenecks bc they show off my chest and waist but don't show any skin. I especially right now love a tight black turtleneck, loose vintage jeans and black combat boots.  In the summer I really like off-shoulder tops bc it shows skin without it being cleavage.    I only show cleavage in a loose top. I have a chiffon skinny strap flowy top that I love wearing all seasons with or without a cardigan or denim jacket. I also have linen long sleeve top with bell sleeves that is very cleavagey in a flattering way.    Hope this gives you some inspo! I don't have pics but if you put some of the descriptors I used +outfits on Pinterest, that could help!	episode_done:True

I'm actually interested in being the person that has two hours to unwind every night, takes a warm bath in a massive tub with a v expensive lush bath bomb, does a full face care routine, brushes her hair out, has little tinctures on her vanity to apply just a bit of perfume, puts on a silk gown, lights a candle, reads in bed, and turns out her lamp at a generous 9:30pm.   The truth is that the desire for the sleepwear is really a desire to have more silence, more time spent on me, and more time doing things that look and feel good simply because I like them and not because they serve any kind of real function.   I have moved away from using old t-shirts because I like the idea of dedicated sleepwear but I usually just go with a solid color cami / tank top / shirt and either some shorts or some sweat pants depending on how cold it is. They're cheaper but still look thoughtful.	labels:>part of making my goals for 2021 has been distinguishing "the person I aspire to be" from "the person I am willing to be" from "the person I can afford to be."   I need to frame this and put it on my wall.  Love your bedtime routine. Also want to mention that I have decided that decent black panties (like the 6-pack from H&M) match all the bras.

text:How do some people put outfits together so effortlessly. Fashionista's please help.	labels:Hi! Former stylist.  1) Pay attention to the fit of things and figure out what cuts and shapes look good on you. Paper bag pants and some joggers have similar fits. Some mini skirts and shorts hit the same place on your legs and can have the same waist height. Find your sweet spot and don’t be afraid to buy multiple things in silhouettes that work for you.   2) Get some statement pieces that you would die for. If you are wearing a pair of jeans that fit well and a t-shit purchased within the past 3 years with some awesome earrings you going to look and feel great. If you are wearing an amazing dress and simple white sneakers you are going to look and feel great. Don’t overthink things but try and wear at LEAST one piece you are excited about at a time.   3) Don’t buy things just cause they are on sale, you saw your friend wearing it, or you feel like you “need” something in your wardrobe. You should love everything in your closet in its own special way unless it’s workwear and you hate your dress code for work. Something as simple as a T-shirt has so many different factors like cut, material, neckline, sleeve length. Purchase what feels good and don’t bother with the rest.
text:This is a perfect list, I would also add that you should not be afraid to break out of any style rules that you have. One thing I do when making myself break a random “rule” I made up for myself is to buy a realistic version (a color/fabric/style I already like/own) and wear the new/weird thing somewhere easy. I just forced myself to buy and wear a kimono top/jacket this way. It was a matching set and I had already bought the pants and had worn them, but didn’t buy the top because I just don’t wear kimonos.   So I bought the kimono top and wore the outfit to my sister’s house first for just a regular hang out, and then I wore it “publicly.” (It’s not really public rn but I wore it to see someone in my non-fam bubble LOL.) After wearing it around at my sister’s house I felt comfortable in it and it no longer felt like a weird thing to wear.   This doesn’t always work, sometimes I just won’t like something, but if I’m drawn to it and the only reason I’m not getting it is because of some internal rule I made up, it usually works.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:How do some people put outfits together so effortlessly. Fashionista's please help.	labels:I don't know about the other ladies out there, but for me there's no magic formula. In my humble opinion, I look good because I take the time to really plan out my outfit, hair, shoes, etc. It really is just practice, repetition, and routine. If it seems daunting to you, here are some smaller steps you can take:  1. Use a website to organize your thoughts - like Pinterest.  2. A lot of department stores have looks and outfit ideas when you are looking for products! It's a great way to go from - 'oh that dress is cute' in a vacuum to figuring out an outfit around it.  3. Practice makes perfect.  4. Practice makes perfect.  5. Try to make one part of your outfit really satisfying to yourself if it seems to much to do the whole thing. For example pick a bag that goes well with your dress. That way, even if your makeup/shoes don't work as well with the outfit you don't get worried about not having the perfect look. You'll still be happy with part of it and you can build from there for next time!  Sometimes, I try to do the 'just woke up but looking fresh effortlessly' look but I don't know if it's actually successful, lol.
text:Yes to the "practice makes perfect". Try things on. Play dress up and experiment with silhouettes. Document what works and what doesn't. I've been documenting my outfits for nearly 10 years now and although I still have some questionable outfits, it's helped me develop an eye for proportions and colors. So there is no "effortless" look, not really. It takes work, and after a while it becomes instinctive.	labels:	episode_done:True

I’m myself trying to follow it but it takes a lot of effort and time and I give up. Any advise on how to actually make it work	labels:Once you hit a certain point in your wardrobe you just need to keep reminding yourself you don’t necessarily “need” anything. I’m also not saying don’t shop and buy stuff! Just don’t buy stuff that after a couple wears have you reaching for your old favorites because you feel the best wearing them. I used to have 5 different tshirts but I would go digging through my hamper for one specific one even if it was dirty because it looked best. That’s what you want to avoid. Similarly, if a brown shoe is on sale but you never wear brown don’t buy it. It will sit in your closet and aggravate you unless you go and buy some stuff to wear it with. Pay the extra for the black and rock them right away. Use per cost is a real thing.	episode_done:True

text:For 1. What pants do you recommend for people who are thin but carry a bit more weight in the core (stomach and butt) instead of their legs and thighs.	labels:It’s hard to say. Even for people who put on weight in the core does it go “out” or “sideways”? Everybody’s body is so different. It’s hard to tell what looks good without trying on different things but usually people are a pretty good judge of what “works” once they find it! Just keep an open mind and be willing to take stuff into a dressing room. A big butt or rounded stomach/hips can be sexy! If you are looking to “hide” something however a good trick is to split it up -ie. layering or accessorizing with a belt, jacket, longer necklace etc.	episode_done:True

I think the common theme is that INTPs don't generally care what others think - and so that can manifest on a spectrum from "wears whatever because does not care about their appearance at all" to "wears completely outlandish things because they care about their appearance but do not care at all what others think of it".      As an INTP myself I fall somewhere between the two. Like... I *want* fashion to be a higher priority for me, but when it comes down to it my attitude is more often just "whatever" because social pressure to look good  doesn't register to me nearly as much as it could.

text:Is anyone into MBTI? Do you feel like your fashion preferences align with your personality type?	labels:INTJ. I basically wear the same outfit every day with (slightly) different colors and fabrics. Long sleeve, fitted, shallow v-neck shirt/sweater; "cigarette" style pants/jeans (or joggers while working from home/being comfy); ankle boots or pointed flats. Everything is solid color; some color blocking when I am feeling adventurous. Everything I wear in public fits well, and any structured piece gets tailored. I like nice fabrics, and the clothing \*must\* make \*me\* look good.  If I could get away with it, everything in my closet would be navy (or at least a dark color). After being accused many times of wearing the same outfit multiple times a week, I have learned to add in flashes of color/accessories to make it clear that yes I am indeed wearing a different outfit than yesterday thanks.

text:Is anyone into MBTI? Do you feel like your fashion preferences align with your personality type?	labels:INFP here! I buy everything second hand, so my wardrobe is a collection of every style and era. I love wearing things that have had a past life before me, and I'm supporting the second hand industry by doing so too.  In less abstract terms, my wardrobe tends to be quite eclectic. Most of my clothes are from the 80s/90s, but I do like to switch it up. Because it's all second hand, my trendy pieces will usually be the older version of a trend! Eg. having mom jeans and floral midi skirts from the 80s, or bootcut jeans from the 00s.  I find it important that my fashion choices reflect my personality, or current mood. For inspiration, I often spend hours looking at old photographs/movies/etc and imagining what these characters would have worn from my wardrobe. Sometimes I'm feeling Britney Spears circa 1999, but other times I want to be a slightly-bohemian period drama character, so I can dress accordingly. I like to have a wardrobe where items can do double duty.  I often feel like I don't know how to express myself, so I love how clothes are a way of easily doing it! That's possibly the most INFP sentence I've ever said, lol.
text:Im ENFP and "my wardrobe is a collection of every style and era" --- so this!  I have some 60 inspired hippie clothes (including some vintage), black biker jackets, a dusty pink oercoat, a multicolored assymetrical jacket that gives me life, a few 80s pieces... i would say I am consistent in my consistency 😂	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Is anyone into MBTI? Do you feel like your fashion preferences align with your personality type?	labels:INFP here :) In the autumn/winter time I prefer to wear “autumn forest colors” like deep green, burgundy, mustard, or maybe white/black/beige. In the summertime I prefer the same colors just a lighter shade of them.  I love wearing knitwear, jeans or corduroy in winter and organic cotton/lace dresses the summer😊 I also love cute accessories, or small details on garments. In shoes I prefer flat ones, mostly sneakers,Oxford shoes, or platform shoes.
text:Oh wow, fellow INFP here, and we're nearly fashion twins! Although my neutrals are navy/cream/beige, and I'd replace your summer lace with linen, and platforms with loafers.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Is anyone into MBTI? Do you feel like your fashion preferences align with your personality type?	labels: I'm  an infp, when it comes to colours I mostly wear greens/ orange/ dusty pink,  and cream/ black neutrals. I like florals, colourful stripes and polka dots. I also wear other patterns if they are in a smaller scale. I prefer fitted/ cropped tops, with looser bottoms. So a typical outfit would be a cute top, mom jeans/ paperbag shorts and sneakers. In winter I'd also wear a cropped sweater/ wrap sweater (it's not cold where I live). Sometimes I wear dresses/ skirts, but it needs to be both comfortable and flattering. I only wear sneakers in every day situations, and when dressing up it's wedge sandals/ thick heeled booties. I walk uncomfortably in other types of shoes so I avoid them. Overall I might align with it? I wear cute things but nothing too crazy	episode_done:True
text:Can we discuss how uncomfortable it can be to dress fashionably sometimes? Must beauty = pain? Looking for comfort tips!	labels:I think you can still look fashionable while ignoring heels etc.   I agree with you on heels, and my foot shape finds them quite uncomfortable, so unless they’re a platform or quite chunky (like with most booties), I just don’t do them.   Now, I personally love high waist (the higher the better, gimme that steve urkle shit 😂) but lower waist, softer fabrics, or even high quality leggings (like faux leather styles) will look much nicer than sweats.   Well-fitting basic t’s look great. They just need to fit properly across your shoulders and chest. Plenty of flat shoes exist that look nice. Vans, leather or leather-ish ballet flats, nice sneakers (e.g. New Balance or similar) with a well-tailored outfit.  Honestly a lot of it comes down to the fit of clothing, the FABRICS (I mean, put on anything pilled and it looks 🥴 immediately), and other styling elements like hair. Hair thrown into a ratty bun with sweats and uggs? Yeah I look sloppy. Straightened hair with joggers and vans? Now I look stylish! Ha.  ETA: that unfortunately body type also comes into play here. There have been quite a few posts detailing how basics look “timeless” and “stylish” on thin frames, and sloppy or unstylish on larger bodies. I thought I would throw this in there just in case, although I think most of my comments still apply regardless of body size!

text:Can we discuss how uncomfortable it can be to dress fashionably sometimes? Must beauty = pain? Looking for comfort tips!	labels:Honestly, to me it sounds like you might find alot of things uncomfortable because they don't fit properly.  Any item of clothing can be comfortable if it fits your body properly.  This is why rich people get things tailored.  I'm a grad student so I can't afford that, but I just make an effort not to buy things that don't fit, and occasionally I get things tailored.  It's hard though, most cheap brands that I can afford don't sell clothes that fit well so it's an effort.	episode_done:True

I can never understand why everyone says they're more comfortable than mid-rise jeans. And because it's in fashion, it's difficult for me to find a jean that looks good but isn't high waisted. Maybe it's because I was a teen in the 90s. I'm glad I'm not the only one!  And amen to the bra situation! I don't want to have to buy a new type of bra just so I can wear a certain type of shirt or dress.	episode_done:True

But you shouldn't have to sacrifice looking fashionable over comfort! They can go together hand in hand! My style is generally long and flowing Korean-style fashion paired with open-toed sandals or other flat shoes and not only do I feel and look good in it, I also feel breezy! I think the tip here is to choose clothes that are not only cute but should go well with your body and ones you feel you can be active and move around with without any fuss! :D Also look for clothes made in natural breathable fabrics like cotton, linen or silk are always great because they breathe well and allow sweat to evaporate more easily unlike synthetic fabrics like nylon and polyester.	episode_done:True

text:Can we discuss how uncomfortable it can be to dress fashionably sometimes? Must beauty = pain?

Uniqlo was a big part of the beginning for me, I really like their airsim and heattech lines. How can my clothes work for me? I really took on a evolutionarily perspective lmao, like I need Shelter from Rain, Insulation in Cold, Sweat Wicking in Sun. It got me to pay attention to fabric choices more, which meant I was pickier, which meant I was buying more expensive items... so then I started to care about the quality of stitching and longevity of the piece.  I had IBS for a year and there were some clothes I could really NOT wear with that, so I had to learn to make adjustments too. I like high-rise bottoms, but I can't have an elastic cutting off my intestines all day, so I get something with a zipper instead.	episode_done:True

text:The Venn diagram of things I would actually buy has the following circles: fits my aesthetic, fits my budget, makes me excited at the outfit possibilities, will make me happy to put on in the morning, will fill in an empty space in my wardrobe, is eco-friendly. Last 2 somewhat optional, but I’m trying to make them as essential as the first 4.  My aesthetic is pretty broad (across several categories of garments and “styles” of dress), but having a more cohesive wardrobe means I have more opportunity to mix and match items and get more wear out of each, so there’s that as an advantage.  I don’t think anyone should force the aesthetic thing until and only if they feel naturally pulled towards that aesthetic specifically, and they know that the things that fall out of that aesthetic won’t bring them as much joy to put on as the things that fit in it.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:How do you guys work towards avoiding fast fashion?	labels:You don't have to make your own clothes, but learning to do some basic repairs (reattaching buttons, patching a small hole or fixing a split seam with needle and thread, maybe using a sweater shaver/depiller or waterproofing your leather shoes) can be really helpful in making things last and look nice longer - so maybe your 2 pound shirt lasts 3 years instead of 2, which means you don't need to buy as many in the long run.	episode_done:True
text:How do you guys work towards avoiding fast fashion?	labels:IMO if you're wearing clothes until they get holes in them, it doesn't matter if you bought them from ASOS or Eileen Fisher -- you're doing better than the majority of people out there who wear something 3-10 times and then donate it.  Yes, buying clothes secondhand is best, but buying something new and wearing it out is pretty damn close.  If you can recycle the fabric again (e.g. rags for the kitchen), even better!	episode_done:True
text:How do you guys work towards avoiding fast fashion?	labels:I second what everyone said about buying stuff secondhand, but just want to add, if you’re going to buy something from a fast fashion store, only buy it with as high a percent of natural fibers as possible. 100% cotton/silk/linen/wool/leather etc. The items will last longer and will look/feel better. Otherwise, you’re buying plastic clothing.	episode_done:True
text:How do you guys work towards avoiding fast fashion?	labels:Personally, I really like thrift shopping. I can't afford high quality brands, and hate fast fashion. By thrifting, I am often able to find old, quality clothing. I got a pair of 90's calvin klein jeans, and some old levi's, and I've even gotten some very quality pants from the 60's-70's that still have tags.   I got a pair of Docs back when they were still made in England, very sturdy and will last me a good while.   A recent find was a very nice custom made elk hide jacket, and it was only $6.   It can definitely take a little bit of time, but it's very worth it. All of the things I have mentioned seem, from text, like they would be worn, ugly, old. But they're very fashionable, almost completely new, and of very high quality. It's a lot of fun, very rewarding, and kind to your budget!	episode_done:True
text:How do you guys work towards avoiding fast fashion?	labels:Just buy things carefully. Really think about what goes with the rest of your wardrobe, and buy things that you would want to wear again and again.  I buy fast fashion, but I have a very small closet. I don't consider my fast fashion items disposable. They are treated with similar care as I would treat the more expensive pieces in my wardrobe, like Max Mara, etc.  I also purchases second hand a lot of the time, and often consider trend cycles when I buy items. I avoid the really trendy stuff - unless it's something I really want to try out, and buy things that wouldn't feel that outdated in 3 years time.  In the case of buying 2 dollar tees and really cheap shoes - it might not be sustainable in the long run, because based on my experience, bad quality tees don't last very long.

text:How do you guys work towards avoiding fast fashion?	labels:second hand shops, indie stores, stores owned by indigenous/native peoples, or just sew up the holes and buy some nice pieces that could be worn everyday with anything. classic looks never go out of style, and if you get a good coat that goes with everything, you can wear the same outfits all year and just change up the outerwear and layer	episode_done:True

text:I was going to say this - I “challenged” myself to buy only secondhand for a year but it’s been so easy it hasn’t even been a challenge and I’ve carried on with it! The downfall is the occasional thing doesn’t fit or look right, but I either re-sell it or practice my (rudimentary) sewing on it. If I buy something off eBay that’s high end and good quality fabric - and would be way out of my budget new - I take to get tailored, because I’m scared I’ll botch it.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do you guys work towards avoiding fast fashion?	labels:I think it’s unavoidable, so yep like another commenter said, just choose wisely, and I would also add don’t ‘give in’ to any whims and infatuations. I put something in my online shopping cart (or even hold it and walk around the actual shop), and a few moments later I realise I don’t need it and close the tab/put it back.  For me the biggest thing is knowing my style. I know what things I look best (yes ‘best’, not just ‘good’) in, so I have these items in my closet and I am not likely to randomly get more clothes whenever I feel like it. And knowing your style, you’ll also know you’ll wear the items you buy a lot, so you’ll not feel bad about spending more money and ‘investing’ in pieces. :)	episode_done:True

Honestly I'm in the UK and it looks like we won't be coming out of frequent lockdowns until maybe June/July at earliest so that leaves less opportunities for going to places and serving snazzy outfits which is sad but hey, it is what it is.  I've been trying to wean myself off buying clothes, not because I hate fashion or something but to combat a shopping addiction I developed in 2017 (basically dealing with any negative emotion by buying clothes) and I've gradually gone down from 80 items a year to 40 and now 25.

If I run into a genuine need, I'll continue checking secondhand options first before buying new. I'll also continue logging outfits daily with Stylebook, because it helps me be honest with myself about what is and isn't getting worn in my closet (both for getting-rid-of purposes AND for informing-future-purchases purposes), *and* it'll help me focus in on what I gravitate toward in my day-to-day life rather than continually shopping for some nebulously just-out-of-reach fantasy self.   Summed up:  * Buy less, buy secondhand, buy practical, buy for TODAY (not a dream and a half from now), and buy only what is genuinely needed (very likely *nothing* for quite a while).  * Continue evaluating what I really need in my life, and how much, and adjust accordingly as time goes on with the goal of seriously paring down my closet to a manageable size.

text:Also, be conscious about the "need" aspect. People tend to say that they need a new sweater, when they really mean they want a new sweater in a different color to match better with some stuff in their wardrobe.  I stopped years ago with those kinds of purchases, because I realized the "shop sustainable" is just talk from people that want to keep buying while not feeling as wasteful.  I haven't bought any clothes for years. No shoes. I have huge style holes in my "fashion matching wardrobe", but I solve that by just not wearing certain items together.  The truth is, it's a bit boring, from a fashion standpoint. I sit there show creaming my old boots and fixing a hole in my bag. But then again, if you already have a sweater, you don't need another one. If you already have a pair of summer shoes, you don't need another pair, no matter how bad they match with some things in your wardrobe.  If one always keeps this in mind, it will feel stupid to replace a super basic pair of pants that are beyond repair with a pair of pants that don't fill the most functions possible. Aka, no sequin pants that can only be worn with heels and a tube top.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Fashion Resolutions and Goals: 2021 Edition	labels:I'm actually going on a no buy for clothing, shoes, and accessories in 2021.  My lone exception is that when my athletic shoes wear out, they will be replaced (as wearing dead athletic shoes hurts your feet).    I have a full closet and TBH too many clothes.  Stopping the inflow will help me get things under control.  And I may have to move at the end of 2021 depending on my WFH situation so less stuff means less stuff to move.	episode_done:True
text:Fashion Resolutions and Goals: 2021 Edition	labels:* Don't buy clothes until I hit my goal weight (post baby). I have plenty of things that currently fit and for the intermediate sizes.  * Once I hit goal weight, don't buy things that don't fit my color palette: blue, pink/mauve, burgundy, white, gray/silver. I'm always tempted by trendy colors, but then don't wear them because they don't actually look good on me.	episode_done:True
text:Fashion Resolutions and Goals: 2021 Edition	labels:Last year, I went on a no-buy last year for 11 months to assess what clothing items I really wanted and finally picked out a few pieces (a cashmere sweater, a pair of loafers, new boots) during Black Friday. I also learned how to mend simple holes in clothing and embroidered some boring shirts to make them feel "new". Tbh, It wasn't really difficult, because during quarantine/online classes, I wore the same few pieces of clothing every day.   This year, I want to clear out clothing that don't fit me anymore or are poor quality/uncomfortable/unfashionable. I recently moved apartments and it was ridiculous how much clothes I had that I never wore. My family used to be a lot more frugal, so all my clothes were from the clearance section (under $5 usually) of fast fashion stores and I picked them without regard to style/quality/fit. I never threw away clothing if it wasn't significantly ripped, so I even have clothing from when I was in middle school.	episode_done:True
text:Fashion Resolutions and Goals: 2021 Edition	labels:Wear more color!  I'm over the all-neutral-everything look I've been doing the past few years - it's not inspiring me anymore.  My other goal is to buy less often, but when I do buy, buy color!	episode_done:True
text:Who else has sensory issues that has figured out ways to not dress boring?	labels:I'm autistic and I have a lot of sensory issues so I can relate. I've found that wearing a layer underneath other things helps. For example, I have uniqlo leggings and a long-sleeve undershirt that I know I like the feeling of against my skin, so if I want to wear a sweater that's kind of scratchy or something else similar I'll just wear an undershirt that protects me. Another thing that helps me is tight sleeveless undershirts tucked into my jeans/skirt/bottom half whatever so that my shirt and waistband don't rub against my skin. (edit: I don't know if this will work in warmer climates, it works where I'm from because it's cold pretty much all year)  I also have a strict policy of not buying things that I know I'll find uncomfortable (and that I don't have a workaround for), wishing that maybe this time it will work. Because it won't, I'll just wear the thing out once and feel bad the entire time and then feel guilty for never wearing it again. If I find something that I really love, I cling to that and try to find similar things in the future and things that will complement those items.	episode_done:True
text:Who else has sensory issues that has figured out ways to not dress boring?	labels:I can't for the life of me handle tight clothing. I'm not diagnosed with adhd but two gps have independently brought up the possibility and I'll look into it with a specialist soon.  I can't handle tights, tight long sleeves, pantyhose, or (and they're the worst ever) skinny trousers, especially jeans. Luckily, with my awkward proportions, almost all clothes that fit me are either too wide, too short (I just don't go for those), or made for boys. So I just go with slightly oversized most of the time. I vary between androgynous styles with inspiration from malefashionadvice or old fashioned looking, almost frumpy dresses, or a combination of a wide, drapy blouse and a flowing wide skirt. The drawback is that I can't really be feminine in winter because tights and leggings are off the table for me and I'd be too cold with bare shins.   That gives me a decent amount of variation! So it might be worth checking men's fashion if you're similar to me, or going for retro/vintage style blouses, skirts, and dresses.	episode_done:True

text:Who else has sensory issues that has figured out ways to not dress boring?	labels:Yes!!! I am a highly sensitive person and I will not wear clothing that is “scratchy.” If it rubs me I am cranky pissy and have to change.   I need to be comfortable. Not tight, soft and smooth cotton or polyester. I do not like silk or anything like silk, I do not like lace especially if it’s under my armpits. It rubs.   I’m just thrift and feel the fabric before buying. I always reach for leggings and T-shirts because I am a houseplant now.   So I don’t like things with tight arms because I have fat flabby arms. So tshirts and tank tops for me. I do not like long sleeves.   Also I am always hot! So long sleeves are almost always a no.   And shoes. Omg shoes! I have have have to wear comfortable shoes or I actually cannot function.	episode_done:True
text:Who else has sensory issues that has figured out ways to not dress boring?	labels:I'm autistic, and yes, it sounds very familiar. I second the sleeveless undershirts or camis to put into the waistband of my pants or skirt. I also buy some extra if after a couple of times wearing something turns out to have a great fit. I have some pants in different colours, but with the same fit, and that helps with not always wearing the same but still knowing they will fit just right. I also have some basic, tagless black shirts and longsleeves, so that I can put a cardigan or blazer over while the shirt kind of blocks the tags or fabric of what I wear over it - that only works when it's not superhot, but that doesn't happen often here anyway.  The main thing is, have some basic skin-layers that feel just right, and put something over to give your outfit that bit of extra without it touching your skin (much).	episode_done:True
text:Who else has sensory issues that has figured out ways to not dress boring?	labels:I find skirts work well for me in that there is no tightness around my legs. If it is really cold I will wear tights too, but they have to fit well and not constrict anywhere. No pressure on my knees, no seams or fabric bunches pressing into my nethers like I might have with trousers or jeans.  I like to feel the swish of a skirt, but from the sounds of it, your trousers wrapping around your legs don't make you feel happy so that may not be something that works for you.  I just find I feel less constricted in a skirt.  I tend to go for circle skirts of knee length or longer.  I'm fussy about fabric too, I don't have any patience for polyester or acrylic or anything that might make me feel sweaty or overheated.   With a skirt I just have the one measurement to be worried about, the waist measurement. As long as that fits well and is natural fibre, I'm golden.	episode_done:True

text:Does anyone else not factor in pants when creating outfits? How to move away from this?	labels:Black jeans make stuff more dressy. Grey jeans match well with pastel colours or with black tops. I would start with those since you are a jeans lover!  Real pants can be more difficult to find a nice cut and length, but if you find a check or pattern you like then those are always the pants I reach for first- it is nice if you have a check with a tiny bit of colour in it cause then it pairs well with plain tops in that colour.

text:Does anyone else not factor in pants when creating outfits? How to move away from this?	labels:Straight or bootcut jeans are a more current look than skinny jeans.

text:Does anyone else not factor in pants when creating outfits? How to move away from this?	labels:I was like this too and just had skinny jeans in different washes for a long time. In the past year or so I’ve collected some more interesting jeans that I love to wear even more and change up every outfit but are still jeans. For example, I have looser fit jeans that have a paper bag waist, looser jeans that have a pinstripe wash pattern, jeans with a plaid wash pattern, wide leg jeans with buttons instead of a fly. I think this, along with the different colored jeans others have mentioned, is a good way to change up your look while still keeping the comfort of jeans.  I’ve found these jeans from Hollister, Levi’s, Gap.  I myself have been looking to upgrade my wardrobe a little bit by looking for some dress pants that I could use to dress up otherwise casual outfits. For inspiration I would look to pinterest or stylist tiktoks. @morgankvogel is a toktoker I just came across that had some aesthetic inspiration tiktoks I liked and she included some stores to get started.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else not factor in pants when creating outfits? How to move away from this?	labels:Ease the transition with chinos, which still have the same sort of feel as jeans but are a step in the direction of "dressier" (please take that with the biggest grain of skepticism, it doesn't even feel right to type).  And then from there, straight-legged or skinny dress pants are just one more step.  I only tend to own my dress pants in black or navy blue, I think I have one single pair of a light grey checkered pattern but I have to be in some kind of mood to wear those.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else not factor in pants when creating outfits? How to move away from this?	labels:I would find a shape you think works for you and try different textures! A black jean is really different from black leather, which is really different from black velvet. I tend to have basically the same pant (black+fitted) in different textures which I love, no harm in it. I would also look at whether any printed pants would suit your needs - if you have a lot of solid tops this could be a fun change.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else not factor in pants when creating outfits? How to move away from this?	labels:Go find yourself a pair of really exciting pants. High waist/wide leg is in right now, so maybe try that silhouette but in a bright color or print. When you get dressed in the morning, sometimes start with your bottoms. Grab your fun pants or a skirt, and build an outfit from there. Honestly the best thing to do is to just make yourself do it.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else not factor in pants when creating outfits? How to move away from this?	labels:I’ve seen a few other comments to this effect... but really a good place to start can just be branching out in denim itself. There are so many different cuts and washes out there now that the particular jeans you’re wearing can have a big impact on the outfit.  I’m a big fan of denim, while I have a few pairs of jeans that “go with anything” I try not to think of them as a default item and pair them with things that make sense for a specific outfit. I have more jeans than most, but that’s because I’ve decide it’s what I love and enjoy having a big variety.   Beyond that, I would really think about what other kind of pants fit your style based off of what you lean towards on the top. Something that others see a lot of use out of may have no place in your wardrobe (ex I keep trying to get beige pants, but I can’t make a single outfit I like with them in my closet - however, I could make several I was happy in with a pair of pink herringbone trousers).	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else not factor in pants when creating outfits? How to move away from this?	labels:Fellow ex—worshipper at the altar of jeans here! I have absolutely fallen in love with a pair of black flowy wide leg crop pants I bought a few years ago and they really helped me get out of the jeans rut. I can pair them with a tshirt for a very casual chill vibe, or something more fitted for instantly work appropriate. They were very much my “gateway pant” into the world of bottom-halves, and mixing up styles that have a more flowy or dressy feel to them - particularly as I’m not big on skirts and prefer to have that “always ready for action” feel about my outfits that pants seem to give	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else not factor in pants when creating outfits? How to move away from this?	labels:YES. I've never paid enough attention to pants in my wardrobe until about two years ago. I mean, years ago when the mom jean/boyfriend jean became I thing, I did hop on the train; but mom jeans and skinny jeans were really the only thing I had, never really paid attention to pants that much. UNTIL TWO YEARS AGO. PANTS CAN SAVE YOU FROM YOUR BORING PANT-LESS LIFESTYLE AND ELEVATE YOUR SOCIAL STATUS.  Well, this was the case for me, at least.  I started with ambitious rips. Then I got more into the loose/baggy jean look. Then I got into joggers, straight-leg, wide-leg, balloon pants, cargo, sweats, patterned pants etc. Now I have a wide assortment of pants that fit every vibe, every minuscule emotion, every single hormone that possesses me that day. Now I'm just a huge pants fan. People are always complimenting me on my pants. Everyone by default pays more attention to what is worn on top when planning an outfit, but when the BOTTOM is factored in -- WOW you really know what you're doing.  There is nothing wrong with skinny jeans -- they're versatile in nature and really can go with everything. But it can get boring quickly. A strong, multi-dimensional pants game can elevate your look and wardrobe. I really do recommend looking at the pants on Aritzia, for example, Or Hailey Bieber's/Kendall Jenner's outfits. I tend to rely on Pinterest a lot for ideas and inspo.  PS. Many times have I failed in my pants journey (bought pieces that were actually quite ugly/didn't work/unflattering/one-time wear kind of thing). BUT BEAUTIFUL PANTS IS A JOURNEY AND A PROCESS. I'd start simple (like a wide-leg or mom jean or patterned loose pant) to ease yourself into a different pant-style. And once you feel more wild and comfortable, explore more.	episode_done:True

I don’t buy into trends now. I know I won’t wear a color that isn’t navy so I don’t bother buying it. No velvet. No shorts. Etc etc. I just have less time for navel gazing and bullshit. Maybe because I’m a nurse in a pandemic who is also in perpetual grad school. Or maybe because I finally have money now to buy what I really want? Either way. No real advice but just a question to think about what you actually want to wear for who you are today.

text:Has anyone lost their wardrobe creativity as they’ve gotten older? How do you get it back?	labels:I lost my fashion mojo for a few years after I had kids. I'm 34 now and I've realized that fast fashion doesn't work for me AT ALL, partly because stuff doesn't fit well anymore and also I don't have the time to browse and try on things in stores (even pre-pandemic I couldn't dedicate time for this). I've started buying less frequently but what I buy, I make sure it's good quality stuff that fits well and is decent quality. Not sure if it's age related but cheap items just don't look good on me anymore!  Same with skincare. I've started investing in quality skincare and it makes a difference.	episode_done:True
text:Has anyone lost their wardrobe creativity as they’ve gotten older? How do you get it back?	labels:Maybe it is my case. I am 24 and I work in the policy/public affairs field and because of that, I have to dress rather conservatively. Upside: I really look put together mostly all the time, because of the job. Downside: maybe because I fear not to be taken seriously, I think that sometimes my style ages me. Nowadays it is so strange for me to use other colors than beige or black.	episode_done:True
text:Has anyone lost their wardrobe creativity as they’ve gotten older? How do you get it back?	labels:Read the Curated Closet if you want to really hone in and define a personal style and how to wear it. Great tips about how to buy clothes purposefully, how to accessorize, how to identify quality, etc.   As far as the aging thing goes - I’ve found I just become more myself. I don’t buy into trends now. I know I won’t wear a color that isn’t navy so I don’t bother buying it. No velvet. No shorts. Etc etc. I just have less time for navel gazing and bullshit. Maybe because I’m a nurse in a pandemic who is also in perpetual grad school. Or maybe because I finally have money now to buy what I really want? Either way. No real advice but just a question to think about what you actually want to wear for who you are today. Not an imaginary person who doesn’t live your life with your budget and your body and your friends, ya know?

text:What are your favorite bags at the moment?	labels:I wear a backpack for work (teacher) but I have a thing for designer purses.  During the pandemic I‘ve mostly been carrying my Louis Vuitton Neverfull GM and my Chanel WoC and if I had to restart my collection again, those two would be on top of the list for me. A WoC (any brand) worn underneath a coat is just so cool to me and I love how carefree it is.  I also have a few Mulberry bags and two Chloes and while I love them, I wouldn’t pay full price for them. Chloe especially I find to be great value for money if you can find sth you like on sale. I got both of my bags 50% off.   I  like Polène which is a lesser known brand. If you are looking to spend up to €500 for a bag, consider Polène, Leo et Violette or Strathberry. I love my Numero Deux but unfortunately the model got discontinued :(.	episode_done:True
text:What are your favorite bags at the moment?	labels:I like small, fairly structured bags for everyday wear. Lately I've been into short shoulder bags (so they hang above the elbow) and top handle bags that sit in the crook of the arm, but crossbody bags are classic and very practical. I recently scored a secondhand Little Liffner bag in sky-blue embossed leather; I'm excited to wear it in the spring with tonal browns and creams or with clashing shades of bright blue and purple. I also have a few fun vintage handbags, and I've always coveted smaller bags by Wandler, By Far and Mansur Gavriel—$$$ though!  If there's a lot of stuff to carry (like a big notebook and a change of shoes or something), I'll carry a separate bigger bag, like a canvas tote or an attache case. It's convenient to carry two bags in these situations; this way essentials like keys or a wallet don't get lost at the bottom of a giant tote.	episode_done:True
text:What are your favorite bags at the moment?	labels:I am a teen, so my bag choices are more influenced based on aesthetic, rather than practicality. Also, I love designer bags.  1. Givenchy Mini Antigona in smooth leather (looks so edgy and bought this for the practicality aspect, as it can hold more items) 2. Gucci Dionysus Super Mini in black leather (can barely fit my phone in there, really is just for the aesthetic lol) 3. Prada Brushed Leather Shoulder Bag with Flap in white (my more casual everyday bag) 4. Dior Medium Lady D-Lite in Blue Cannage Embroidered Velvet (probably the sexiest bag I’ve ever seen) 5. Small Lady Dior (when I’m feeling a bit fancier)  I’m thinking of adding a Louis Vuitton backpack to my collection for days when I want everything out the way on my front and just need my hands free and also a Dior Saddle Bag. All of these bags just bring me a sense of pride ever since I started gaining interest in high fashion items. Even though I could easily buy it with my parents’ money, I busted my butt working as a barista to pay for these items, and I cherish each and every one of them. It’s even more special that I worked so hard and put in so many hours to be able to purchase them, which means so much more to me than having every luxury bag on the market. If that were the case, they wouldn’t be special anymore and wouldn’t hold the same value to me.  I also really wanted the Louis Vuitton Pochette Accessoires, for when I need to get out for a quick errand, but they’re sold out on the website :(	episode_done:True
text:What are your favorite bags at the moment?	labels:Currently I have a small, black, crossbody purse that I thrifted years ago. I usually wear that when I want to look more put together because it goes with everything. When I don’t care about appearance as much, I have a waterproof backpack from rei that I use all the time. I live in a rainy area and I walk almost everywhere so it has been perfect for my lifestyle.	episode_done:True
text:What are your favorite bags at the moment?	labels:I have a Fendi from the 90s (hand me down from my mother) that I wear most of the time. I also use a Herschel backpack for work. I just got the Botkier SoHo medium hobo and it’s a bit larger than I’m used to, but very nice!	episode_done:True

text:What are your favorite bags at the moment?	labels:For work I have a black tall structured tote from Cuyana.  On weekends I gravitate towards bags that can be worn crossbody.  Right now my go to is my black Loewe puzzle bag.  For dinners out and special occasions, of which there are none right now, I use my favorite bag of all time, my black Chanel Reissue.	episode_done:True
text:What are your favorite bags at the moment?	labels:I just bought a Dagne Dover neoprene backpack for work and I love it so far!

I throw a smaller handbag inside so I can take that to lunch or coffee instead of the whole backpack.	episode_done:True

text:Inspo Album: Y2K Style For Anybody!	labels:It finally happened. I am old enough for the fashion I grew up in to be fashionable and trendy again
text:I'm having the exact same reaction. And I wasn't a huge fan of this style the first time around. But OP I do like several of the work outfits and I think you did a good job at incorporating the Y2K aesthetic into work appropriate pieces.  This style of fashion was a serious reaction to grunge and reflected the more optimistic and hopeful feeling around the early 2000s. I was in high school for grunge and in grad school and working in the 2000s and the kids 5-10 years younger than me absolutely loved this style but I 100% hated it, and I was definitely not optimistic (and unfortunately was correct about a lot of my guesses about the future). It's a look that reflects a very specific moment in time.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Inspo Album: Y2K Style For Anybody!	labels:It finally happened. I am old enough for the fashion I grew up in to be fashionable and trendy again

Now that I don't have an occasion to see people as much, I want my outfits to be more memorable to make up for it. The icy blue and lime green tones really pop against my skin too, and its just such a vivid contrast to the more adult, classic style I've been trying to force myself into in the last few years. ~~Plus low-rise jeans make my butt look amazing~~  Essentially, it's all of the clothes I remember loving as a child, as well as what I wanted to emulate from my cool older cousins!	episode_done:True

Even though I'm home all by myself and the only person who ever sees me is the Amazon delivery guy who I wait for by my window because *oh my god, I need human contact,* I'm still putting on a full face of makeup, doing my hair, and wearing spanx, a push-up bra, a sheath dress that fits like a second skin, 4" heels, and perfume.  I'm doing it for *me*, you know, because feeling sexy while I'm all by myself is much more important than being comfortable. Sure, it's easier to get coffee and cheeto stains out of my bathrobe than a 100% wool dress, but cheetos aren't sexy either.

I REALLY do so hope.* I tried ***so*** hard this year. I realized that *layers* are a thing! God, so many *layers*. New colour combinations, mixings textures, jackets! SO MANY OPTIONS. This is my problem, though.. I think I've been going too far with my newly found appreciation for *layers.* I've been **hot**. The sweaty kind. Beads of sweat dripping down my forehead at all times. I've been having to drink twice as much water, as advised by my doctor. My doctor doesn't know why I've been so dehydrated, and honestly, I didn't know why either. Until a few weeks later, I was weak and tired, eye's sunken in with dark purple circles sitting beneath them, bad hand shakes. That bad physical health night, I began to remove my clothing to get ready for bed. I began by peeling off each of my four pairs of socks, (the first layer was a simple ankle sock for padding, the second layer was a sock longer with large frills all around ,the third sock was a sock that went to my upper ankle, shorter than the frilly one and the fourth pair with were giant fluffy socks), it was that moment, when my hand slid against my sweat-dampened foot, why I might be so sick. I looked over to my bed, where my pajama assemble lay. I glanced over at each piece of clothing, a sports bra, an undershirt, a tight long-sleeved, a loose fitting shirt, a big knitted sweater, a shawl, warm leggings, long socks, boxers and pajama pants. **The** ***layers***. That must be it!  I feel better now, I stopped wearing so many layers, but now I have *no idea* what to do with layers! I have no self control. I can't bring myself to just wear **some** layers, once I match an undershirt with a tee-shirt, it's game over.  Santa will be leaving me a book on how to manage my Obsessive Compulsive Disorders. I just can't stop once I get going.	episode_done:True
text:Shitpost Saturday: Naughty or Nice?	labels:Naughty. I work from home now, I wear the same hoody for a full week. I rotate shlumpy t-shirts, yoga pants and sweatpants. I wear sports bras instead of regular bras because they are more comfy.  On weekends, I put on a stretchy pair of jeans and wear the same top for any activities outside, because I give up.  Sometimes I wear a Fancy Hoody.  I haven't out on more than tinted chapstick and a quick swipe of mascara in months.  I did get myself a cute new pair of duck boots from Costco. On some girls they look cute and stylish.  On me, it looks like im a middle age mom of 3, who has just tromped around the muddy dog park. Because I am and I have.  Santa.

I only kept and subscribed to channels that tend to do their research or seem pretty down to earth. Honestly a pretty good rule of thumb is, does watching this person make me feel good and fulfilled afterwards? Inspired even? If not then, i just don't watch their videos anymore. YT is suppose to entertain you, not make yourself feel bad.  Someone mentioned Justine Leconte in the comments and for ex, after her videos, i just feel so much more knowledgeable, like i actually got something out of it. I like watching bestdressed because her personality is relatable and she knows she has imperfections but still posts anyway. Jessica Neistadt is one that hasn't been mentioned yet, but i watch her cause she has a good energy. Most of her hauls are thrifts so they're affordable, with a few expensive pieces here and there. Also, she has a quote of the day at the end of her videos. Obviously, what makes me happy isn't an answer for everyone.  I tend to mix up my feed as well so I don't get tired of one topic too quickly (food, social experiments, science, video games)

text:Everyone’s opinions on Youtube fashion channels?	labels:I used to spend all of my free time watching beauty guru videos. I learned pretty quickly how badly that impacted me! Watching beauty content on a much more controlled scale, avoiding hauls, etc helped a lot so once I started getting into fashion I applied the same logic.  Pixielocks is my favorite fashion influencer. Her video about Lirika Matoshi's Strawberry Dress really transformed the way I think about clothing, got me to quit fast fashion, led me to my favorite brands (Big Bud Press & Mokuyobi), and gave me the inspiration I needed to finally start building a real wardrobe for myself instead of just living in "good enough" clearance rack finds. Her entire house and wardrobe is almost 100% my aesthetic so following her on Youtube and Instagram makes me happy.  I also really like these channels, although I watch them less.  - The Stitchess. Her style isn't as close to mine but her videos are very informative and interesting to me. - Karolina Żebrowska. Her fashion history videos are so cool! - Rachel Maksy.

I have mostly skinny black pants and black skirts as bottoms. Even though they’re all Different to me I can imagine that they look the same to others.   I don’t particularly mind this because it feels like a signature look to me, and I think I look good in my outfits. To me, it just signifies that I know what I like and wear it on repeat! If you are happy with what you are wearing, I wouldn’t worry about trying to mix it up for the sake of mixing it up. I always think: do I, someone who likes clothing, remember what my officemate was wearing when I saw her two days ago? Nope! It’s probably safe to assume she doesn’t remember what I wore either. Heck, I don’t even remember what I was wearing myself.	episode_done:True
text:How many distinctly different outfits do you have?	labels:So, I have a lot of different silhouettes and nice outfits that are distinct, carefully coordinated and look great; However, in practice I wear a comfortable simple uniform (jeans and sweaters) that is not any of these ‘extra’ outfits 80% of the time because I can’t be bothered with the extra fuss. It’s a little sad that the nicer outfits only get 20% of the action, but oh well, I’ve come to terms with my reality.  Overall I’m happy that I have the option to enjoy fashion and feeling put together when I’m in the mood for it. All the other times, it’s just normie boring stuff that looks vaguely similar every day. I don’t worry too much about others’ option on my boring clothes since I work in tech and most people don’t care about fashion. I get a lot more scrutiny (I’ve been asked if it’s my birthday, if I was interviewing etc.) when I wore my nicer district clothes.	episode_done:True
text:How many distinctly different outfits do you have?	labels:I don’t think you should have to change unless you wanted to:) You sound like you have a fantastic wardrobe that works for you and brings you joy. I also love neutrals, wines, and forest greens and I don’t think there is anything wrong with it!   Perhaps some people might not notice, but the same people may not notice even if you had a diverse wardrobe because they may not be too interested in clothing in general. So please don’t let that discourage you.  I think it’s lovely how you pick clothes that have details that set them apart from others, and I think the people you meet often or people who enjoy style and clothing may notice and appreciate the differences.   There is also quite a large capsule wardrobe community these days so you might find that interesting. Everyone does it a little differently so you might want to browse around a bit to find someone who does something similar (some are more rigid than others), but capsule wardrobes tend to have focus on quality over quantity, and appreciating the smaller details. Maybe you’ll find some inspiration without any pressure of having to drastically change your wardrobe;)	episode_done:True
text:How many distinctly different outfits do you have?	labels:no-one is paying attention to what you wear day to day. when was the last time you thought “oh, this coworker wore the same outfit this week”?
text:I sat next to my coworker for almost 2 years before she told me she wears the same thing each day of the week. So, every Monday is the same outfit, every Tuesday, etc...I knew that I had seen shirts before, but I had no idea I'd only seen 10 shirts total (warm weather and cold weather). She thought I was the most unobservant person ever, lol	labels:I feel like the only way to notice that is if you commonly have weekly meetings, and even then it would have to be pretty distinctive for me to actually pick up on the pattern.

text:How many distinctly different outfits do you have?	labels:I think that’s a great way to do your wardrobe.  I am also pretty limited in the colors I prefer, but like to do a lot of different shapes. So, a fitted navy sweater over a long gray skirt is different from a navy tunic over slim gray pants and a navy wrap top over gray joggers, and so on.	episode_done:True
text:How many distinctly different outfits do you have?	labels:I have a lot of clothes, but only a handful of silhouettes. Right now, I'm wearing a lot of open cardigans/sweaters in solid color with an interesting shirt under, jeans, and ballet flats or oversized sweaters, leggings, and ankle boots. I'm not repeating items very often (well, jeans and leggings get repeated...) but I'm not really mixing up the shape either. I like it because I *think* I've found shapes that work for me and then within that, I can experiment and have fun. When I mess around with the overall shape, I often feel out of place or frumpy or something...but within the basic element, there is tons of ways to mix it up (color, texture, material, accessories, etc)	episode_done:True
text:How many distinctly different outfits do you have?	labels:One. All my outfits are the same color story and almost all are elbow length midi dresses. I like having a signature style and not having to worry about matching.	episode_done:True

text:How many distinctly different outfits do you have?	labels:I've wondered about the same thing a lot before. I spent some time working in Japan, and I had a fairly limited professional wardrobe there. I had a handful of skirts, with only two silhouettes really - a long maxi and a full a-line knee-length. To add to that, two pairs were literally the same skirt, just in two different colors. So I had to plan how I wore them pretty carefully to try not to repeat them more than once a week, and to try to avoid a weekly schedule of skirt wearing. What I really relied on was my blouses and sweaters, because although their silhouette and fit was also very similar to one another, they tended to have patterns and be more distinguishable that way.  To be honest though, I think I spent a lot of time worrying over something that few people really paid much attention to. There were a few times I forgot to do laundry and ran out of clothes, so I had to repeat an outfit before I wanted, and no one ever commented or gave me weird looks. And I definitely knew people who just repeated things all the time and didn't care. I think if anything, if many of your clothes are very similar, it makes it easier to dress and just becomes a distinctive style trait.	episode_done:True

text:Online Styling Services?	labels:In addition to all the wonderful advice above, some stylists on Instagram regularly have weekly blog posts or stories posts where they ask their followers to send in any styling questions and they give their advice for free!   Personally I recommend waiting if you decide to try any paid styling services until after the pandemic because it opens up the option for meeting with a stylist in person, and also it makes it easier to try on the various things they recommend in a shop/mall as opposed to getting a couple things in a few sizes shipped to you and dealing with returns. Plus, sometimes colors differ from screen to screen so if they are trying to give advice about colors that suit you, the monitor differences could potentially cause problems.	episode_done:True

Not for personal styling but for makeup I’ve slid into the DM’s of a couple makeup artists for online lessons, game changing.
text:Ooohh thanks for sharing! I actually rarely go clothes shopping with my friends so I'll try it out more	labels:Ask someone for a zoom hour of going through what you have and recs.  The more specific you can be about your preferences and limitations (for me I don’t do dry cleaning or heels over 1.5) the better your results will be, pro’s and the online services have a form you go through but what I really like asking a friend is the bonding experience and cute compliments, people are always flattered when you tell them that you admire their style.

text:How do men's outerwear differ from women's? I found a really good deal on a 100% wool coat, but in men's...	labels:I would check out Aritzia for wool coats. I think right now they're on sale for more or less 200 dollars and they're made from Italian wool.   Otherwise, I would highly suggest getting the size as close to you as possible and consider getting it tailored--especially if you intend to get a nice coat that lasts a long time. I think it's definitely worth the money tailoring nice clothes to your body!
text:A word of caution about tailoring - it’s the shoulders that will most likely need tailoring, but it is very difficult and very expensive to alter shoulders on a coat, and may not be physically possible depending on how much you need them taken in.   I tried it once with a men’s peacoat and brought it to the best, most experienced tailor in town, and even he really struggled with it. In the end, he could not take the shoulders in far enough without ruining the structure of the coat. He did the best possible job he could, it was not at all his fault, but it cost a lot and I didn’t really like the result.	labels:This is very true, And another problem is the size of the armhole. The armholes tend to be very big on men's coats, and no tailoring can actually add in fabric to make the size more reasonable. A man's coat would have armholes halfway to the waist on me, which greatly reduces the arm range of motion.
text:Yes, I had this issue with my coat too! It’s one of the reasons I didn’t like the result... the sleeves ended up looking really disproportionate, and not in a cool, intentional way.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do men's outerwear differ from women's? I found a really good deal on a 100% wool coat, but in men's...	labels:It'll be fine wearing it open, but it'll be tight around the bust and hips if it's closed.    Plus there might be more shoulder padding to give you an exaggerated V shape. Fine if you're intentionally going for an androgynous look, just don't expect it to look/fit like a women's coat.

text:How do men's outerwear differ from women's? I found a really good deal on a 100% wool coat, but in men's...	labels:Unfortunately men's styles aren't an easy fit on curvy women. You'd have to size up a couple of times to make room for boobs and hips and at that point, the shoulders would be disproportionately large and the fit would be very boxy. That's not something easy to tailor or worth tailoring.  H&M currently has women's coats in 100% wool, around $150, if they're not sold out yet. They had several styles a couple of weeks ago. There are options for women high in wool content, no need to venture into the men's section if it's not a sure fit. Off the top of my head, Artizia, Zara, and Massimo Dutti all also carry wool coats in the $100-$300 price range.
text:Do you know if quality of the wool coats at H&M will be lower quality? Say getting a 100% wool coat from H&M/F21 versus jCrew? I mean, I've even seen people write in this sub that their Aritizia wool clothes didn't hold up for more than 1-2 seasons	labels:	episode_done:True

text:How do you shop in COVID?	labels:I’ve gone to online shopping only post Covid. It was definitively challenging at first to guess my size and learn to interpret my measurements (def measure yourself, there’s guides online) and the stores’, but it gets better with time!   It is easiest to stick to brands you already have clothes from, or alternatively use online stores that calculate your size for you based on other clothes you have (Saks, Bloomingdales and other large department stores offer this feature). The next part is to shop only on sites that allow returns (original payment, not store credit), preferably for free. Many big retailers do this already - with the final sale caveat. My favorites that I shop at most are Shopbop.com, Reformation, Saks, Aritzia (careful, they only refund to original payment non sale items), Bloomingdales, Lululemon, Farfetch, Banana Republic, J Crew, Abercrombie and Fitch. In general though, I won’t buy anything without checking out the site’s return policy first, and I usually don’t shop at places that don’t accept returns.  I acknowledge that some of these may have allegedly unethical practices, but I can’t afford (time, effort, health, money, etc.) finding alternatives at this time. I kindly ask that we don’t focus on that aspect sub the op didn’t specify they wanted ethic retailers only.	episode_done:True
text:How do you shop in COVID?	labels:I have had the opposite experience because I'm gaining weight! I work from home in my one-story home now so it's easy to go a whole day without getting even 25% of the steps I normally would take, pre-pandemic. That plus stress-eating equals weight gain, but I'm trying to be kind to myself.   This does mean, however, that I don't fit in 75% of my clothes. I still have stretchy size 8 jeans in my closet I need to part with, which is absolutely crazy considering size 14 is what fits me most comfortably now.  I love to dress up and was often the overdressed person at pre-pandemic gatherings, so I get what you're saying about wanting nice things to wear on the rare occasion that you're seen. It feels nice to change it up from my favorite cozy/comfy sweatpants outfit I wear most days.   That said, I haven't been shopping as much as I normally would, but when I do, it's usually in-person from retail nearby so I can see items in person. I size up from what I think would fit (trying to be honest with myself) and usually it works out fine. I sometimes will over-buy, take things home to try on, then return what doesn't work. It's not perfect but that's what I've been doing, occasionally.  If I shop online, I shop from my trusted brands only, or again I follow my size-up rule.  Mostly though, I've found that the few cuter things I buy (like a Vera Wang blouse or a sweater dress from the Target down the street) hang in my closet for months before I realize I was fooling myself to think I'd rather wear this to sit at my desk than pajamas.	episode_done:True
text:How do you shop in COVID?	labels:I worked at Kohl's in college and spent my fair share of time cleaning out fitting rooms.  In normal times, those are the grossest places ever (you don't even want to know what kind of shit I found in there-- including literal shit).    TBH the only clothes I've purchased since Covid were PJ pants (because my old ones split in the ass).  They were from Walmart (so I could go even during a lockdown).   Oh and I bought a sweater dress at Primark.  Now, most of the clothes I buy run SML as opposed to numbered sizes.  Even dresses.  I generally just hold them up to my body and pray that they work (and return if they do not).    I tend not to buy clothes online because the quality is so inconsistent from store to store (and even within a store).  I need to actually feel the quality.	episode_done:True
text:How do you shop in COVID?	labels:I actually did a bit of a wardrobe overhaul right before COVID started (just happened to be around my birthday which is the only time I really do much clothing/jewelry shopping), and then promptly didn't get a chance to wear any of it, so I haven't purchased much outside of basics during the pandemic. I bought a few pieces I had been hunting down (a pair of Jeffrey Campbell booties, an embroidered "kimono") and filled some holes (fashion-over-function sandals, an easy summer dress) but other than that, I've taken the pandemic as an opportunity to focus on bulking out my basics. Finding the "perfect" undies, socks, etc and then stocking up. So nothing where I really needed to try anything on first or do returns, for the most part. All online, which isn't too much different than pre-pandemic minus the odd thrifting excursion. It's actually been nice, being on a limited income I tend to feel pressured to prioritize the clothing people can actually see. But since my "regular" wardrobe isn't getting worn practically at all, I finally have some flexibility to splurge on a nice pair of joggers or buy a couple camis specifically for lounging in (instead of having to "save" them for wearing with outfits). I'm definitely a maximalist and still get dressed up for certain meetings, but I haven't been getting dressed up "just because" mostly to avoid wear and tear on clothes that I haven't had a chance to wear anywhere yet.	episode_done:True
text:How do you shop in COVID?	labels:I did a complete wardrobe overhaul and at first was going to buy my items from regular online shopping like at J Crew and Banana Republic, but then I realized I could find those same items secondhand through Depop. I usually find online shopping to be a pain, but being able to search for specific essentials I need for my wardrobe and also scroll through and find unique vintage pieces made the process really entertaining. It turned out that I enjoyed this way more than regular shopping in stores!   The way I tackled it was I searched for specific items I needed that were essential to me (e.g. black velvet square neck top) and did my best to avoid fast fashion items that I knew weren't built to last. If I needed help visualizing a piece, I asked for a try-on pic, measurements of the bust/waist/hip/length to make sure it fit my body the way I wanted it to, and material content. It's nice too that I'm supporting a small business and oftentimes messaged with whoever I was buying for a bit to ask questions about the item and maybe haggle a bit, that social aspect was nice. Essentially 90% of my closet is secondhand from depop now after shopping over the course of a couple months and I love that I'm in love with every piece that I have and was able to curate each one to suit my needs.  It definitely takes some patience and a good eye for pieces/what materials are best, but I think that's far better than how I originally used to shop and has taught me a lot about how I'm allowed to be picky and absolutely love and enjoy my items, instead of buying things just because it's on sale even though I'm only lukewarm about it. You can find some really good deals and unique vintage pieces while saving money and saving clothing from landfills!	episode_done:True
text:How do you shop in COVID?	labels:Get measuring tape and read reviews when ordering online. Pay attention to size charts and stretchy/non stretchy fabrics. Shop from places with free returns. ASOS has always been my go to for a wide variety of brands, premier free 2 day shipping for a year ($19) and free returns. Ive always preferred shopping online because I hate waiting in line and get overwhelmed by stores, and I haven’t had much of a problem with them over the last 5 years	episode_done:True
text:How do you shop in COVID?	labels:I find some websites also have good customer service centers where you can ask questions about sizing and get a better idea of fit. So I'd find those companies and just reach out.   That said, I certainly have just stuck with what I know - no new styles for me! I was eyeing up a very nice jacket and even put it in my cart only to panic and abandon the order, because I just wasn't sure the style would work on me.	episode_done:True
text:How do you shop in COVID?	labels:I moved to a big city in 2012 and driving and parking is miserable, so I have been online shopping for years now.  I use Zappos and Amazon a lot. For Zappos returns, you print a label, tape it up and take to any UPS place. I have a very difficult time buying shoes, so I might order a dozen pair and sometimes return them all. If the business wants to do this, I am cooperative.  You have to check on Amazon before you purchase and make certain it's returnable. UPS will box it up for you, it's amazing.  I hear Kohl's does also, but I never go there. You can print your own label and return it to an Amazon locker, that's even easier than a UPS store.  I check my measurements carefully and read a lot of reviews. I don't actually return much that I buy except for shoes.  I buy everything online, but bras? I don't know, that might be difficult.	episode_done:True
text:How do you shop in COVID?	labels:I mainly thrift, but I'm a stickler for trying things on in store and since I don't feel comfortable shopping in person anyways, I've finally sucked it up and tried out Depop.  It's been about 5 years since I last did any online clothing shopping, but I've had pretty good luck with it so far, but I've got a good eye for what shapes are gonna work for me, and I always message the seller about something before I buy.  I probably would have picked up a couple of things for Asos, but they don't do video anymore, so I'll probably try and tackle Poshmark next for some of the more fun pieces on my list.	episode_done:True
text:How do you shop in COVID?	labels:This pandemic is forcing me to learn how to return and drop off packages, and overcome all of my anxiety doing it. I basically only shop thrift in person now, to support local stores, and I do online for everything else. Some of my online has been surprising (like ordering two sandals 9.5 and finding them to be too big) and others were amazing (a Banana Republic Factory fit and flare dress fitting me perfectly?? How) But I basically decided that I think I need to spend more time studying and gathering wardrobe inspiration, and taking care of basics. I also went to my local Fleet Feet and got fitted for proper walking shoes and a sports bra, so I can start exercising for my health. All in all, it's been a mix.	episode_done:True
text:People who built your wardrobe consciously from scratch - what were your strategies?	labels:I lost a lot of weight recently (AUS size 18/16 to 8), so this is probably the third time I have rebuilt a wardrobe. I am also a teacher and approaching my 30s so I wanted to appear more put together than what I did in my 20s.  It was difficult as I was anxious when clothes shopping because I had no idea what size I was at the time. My first step was to at least buy some basic but nice quality pants, I started with two pairs of jeans that I could wear to work or casually to figure out my size. She also showed me some blouses they had on sale at the time. I left with two tops and two pairs of jeans.      After knowing my size I went to a store like H&M and purchased a few more basic pieces such as blouses and pants that were suitable for work when I needed to be more professional and opposed to casual. During winter I purchased a couple of pieces that were on sale at MYER that were suitable for our weather, I also got two pencil skirts for variety.  I also took time to walk around my local shopping centre to see what was available close by to my home so I could identify what stores I should keep an eye on or watch for sales. When some of the stores I like are having a sale I will pop in and purchase a couple of things.  I also had to purchase new shoes as I lost half a shoe size (AUS 8 - 7.5)  Overall, start with some basics and keep an eye on the stores you like for sales. Every now and then if you really like something buy it. Even though I purchased all these nice clothes if I were a sim my default outfit would be tights and a denim shirt at the moment.	episode_done:True
text:People who built your wardrobe consciously from scratch - what were your strategies?	labels:I used to wear the headscarf for years, and now I don't anymore. I don't have anything to wear, either, so I'm building my wardrobe from scratch too. Saving this!	episode_done:True
text:People who built your wardrobe consciously from scratch - what were your strategies?	labels:I have been rebuilding my wardrobe for the last couple of years because I have the financial means to do so at this point in my life, and I feel like I finally have a good sense of what works/what I like.  This is what I kept in mind when making my purchases:  - What type of fabrics/colors/fit do I find myself reaching for the most often? - What outfits were my favorites in the past? What qualities about them made me feel confident/comfortable/good? Were my favorite outfits also my most worn? Why yes or no? - What occasions/situations do I need the most clothes for?  For me, I realized that I heavily favored natural fabrics that drape while still having some hints of structure. Fabrics like linen, cotton, and wool. I like black, cream, camel, burnt orange, and earthy reds.   When I had a good sense of what I needed and wanted, I did the following:  - Bought basics first. Well-fitting pants, solid tops, good undergarments like slips/bras/underwear. These basics followed my general rules for fit/cut/quality/fabric/color story.  - Only purchase items that fit perfectly. I realized that if something was even slightly too long, too tight, too whatever, I wouldn't end up wearing it.  - After I had the basics, I started purchasing items that I could build on the basics to create awesome outfits. I would only purchase something if I could think of ways to incorporate it into multiple outfits.	episode_done:True
text:People who built your wardrobe consciously from scratch - what were your strategies?	labels:I lost a whole load of weight and got bed bugs, which lead to me throwing out or not being able to wear a good portion of my wardrobe. Tbh it really sucked to no longer fit into all this beautiful clothing I had tailored to fit me perfectly, but that’s life I guess  What I actually did was basically buy a capsule wardrobe - I really like neutrals, so I bought only neutrals, and made sure everything worked with everything else. I’m pretty good at knowing what my style is, and all the pieces I got were pretty straight forward, but they all matched. What was good too, is I was able to buy a couple base pieces, and then after that I would buy stuff as I came across it. That way I wasn’t buying everything in one go, and was able to think about what I bought and if it would work for me. I did watch some capsule wardrobe videos on YouTube which helped.	episode_done:True
text:People who built your wardrobe consciously from scratch - what were your strategies?	labels:This might not be helpful at all, but here’s how it worked out for me:  My first realization was that (for me) basics are overrated. I only like certain types of pants and never wear basic, plain tees. So I got enough skinnie jeans to last me throughout the week (which is 3 in my case) - two in black, one in a timeless jeans shade. Then I got just enough lounge/sleepwear to last me between washes. I had a small handful of old sweaters and tees that I didn’t love and phased out (still keeping them around for yard work) when I got items I loved.  From here on I decied to take it slow and *only* get pieces that   a) worke with what I have, and b) genuinely excite me.  In my case that meant (second hand) designer pieces that I meticulously picked out.  They needed to be timeless, of high enough quality to last years, fit me and suit me, and reasonable to care for. (Learning how to properly care for your clothes goes hand in hand with that)  If I saw something I loved (for example an 80s Fendi monogram jeans skirt, a lovely navy blue N. Pearl men’s turtleneck that looks just the right kind of oversized on me) I’d jump at it, otherwise I made due with what I had.  I slowly built my wardrobe like that. I only purchased 2-3 pieces a month and was really really picky. I either bought outstanding “wow”-pieces, or items I *really* needed at the time (a winter coat for example).   While I don’t have a large variety of clothes to pick from, I’m genuinely excited to get dressed every day.	episode_done:True
text:People who built your wardrobe consciously from scratch - what were your strategies?	labels:Okay, I would start with two pairs of nice jeans, two pairs of leggings, one set of pajamas. 5 undergarments and 5 socks. 2 good bras. Three casual tops and one going out top. One warm jacket and one fashion jacket. One sweater. One nice dress and one nice pair of heels. A pair of sneakers, boots, and flats or sandals. To start! You can always add in a cardigan that matches to other things. I hope this helps?	episode_done:True
text:People who built your wardrobe consciously from scratch - what were your strategies?	labels:I'm a fashion graduate and have worked in fashion in some way since college, I found while I tended to make my own clothing or shop in thrift stores I was still hoarding clothing constantly (mainly with a "oh that fabric might come in handy even if I don't wear that!").   I moved to the UK from the States and realised my South Coast wardrobe wouldn't really work in London. I brought a few staples such as dungarees and jeans that fit like a glove with me and then just rebuilt when I moved.   I tend to ask myself   * Will I wear this in five years time?  * Is this well made? * Does it match at least three other things I own? * Does it make me feel good?   I found that I stayed away from things that were just a 'good deal' and fads. I don't have a Pinterest but I definitely know that I prefer earth tones and tend to stick to those :)	episode_done:True
text:People who built your wardrobe consciously from scratch - what were your strategies?	labels:I had to start over once. Basically, I graduated college in 2008, during the recession. I was poor, and being paid for shit. As I found better pay, I also immediately had 2 kids, so I was a million different sizes, with lots of bills. As a result, my wardrobe was ill-fitting cheap stuff. It was a mish-mash of styles and sizes. Most was from Goodwill and other thrifts/garage sales, Old Navy, Forever 21, etc. My casual wardrobe was basically stained sweatpants that I never left the house in. Everything was purchased solely on it's cheapness, and my work clothes didn't have to "fit", they just had to pass as office attire. It sucked, and I didn't feel great about myself.  Once my husband and I finally changed jobs enough to get to a good place financially, and my kids got old enough that a lot of the baby bills subsided, I finally had the money to fix my clothes. Before I started, I lost about 40 pounds to be back where I wanted to be. I then went to the stores and tried on A TON of stuff to find out what looked good on me and what I liked. I only bought things that served a purpose for me, and I ruthlessly purged things that didn't. I also stopped buying from "fast fashion" places, and I mindfully thrifted/bought only quality pieces from quality brands.   It honestly took a couple of years, but I think I'm finally done. I actually don't own that many clothes, because I get rid of anything that isn't being used often enough. I find that having one good, black dress that fits me serves me far better than having 10 ill-fitting, cheaper dresses. It's my only formal dress, and I have used it for pretty much all weddings and funerals. It's comfortable, it looks great on me, and I change the look with my shoes, bag, and jewelry. My wardrobe is built around workhorses like that that cover many occasions and that I want to reach for because of how good they make me feel.	episode_done:True
text:People who built your wardrobe consciously from scratch - what were your strategies?	labels:I started in 2017 and just finished this year and I am very happy with how my closet looks now!  First, I got rid of everything. I was transitioning from a cheap college wardrobe to a semi-professional one (I teach kids). I wanted to strip my closet down to the bare bones, keeping only what I truly wanted, and then building on top of what I had. I did a Marie Kondo type thing, almost. I kept a few things that were of higher quality or that I really liked, and donated the rest.  Then I got the absolute basics: a few neutral blouses, jeans and black pants, replaced some of my most worn out shoes that "went with everything." Then I built from there.  After that, then came the dirty work. Hours upon hours of Pinterest-ing, reading style books, saving money every month and then teaching myself to be ok with spending that money, successful and unsuccessful shopping trips, plenty of thrifting, scouring online sales, swapping with friends, cataloging everything and building outfits via the app StyleBook. I did a lot of online shopping this year and there were some truly awesome sales so I was able to truly round out my closet for much of this year. I finally have it in a good spot.  My style skews very classic and preppy and timeless, so a lot of what I have in my closet will be in style for years. I couldn't be more happy with how it looks; it's easily mixed and matched and because I spent over three years building it slowly, much of it is also tailored and bought thoughtfully. I will add little things here and there, but for now, and for the first time ever, I am content with it!	episode_done:True
text:People who built your wardrobe consciously from scratch - what were your strategies?	labels:For winter buy a good coat with a hood if it rains a lot and lots of wool/thermal basics.

text:I was so crestfallen that I couldn't get my hair to do those spikey hairstyles like Lizzie Maguire and the Olsen twins. I went crazy with the tiny plastic clips though.

text:Anyone here has the habit of needing to buy a new clothing/set of clothings when attending an occasion/going somewhere?	labels:I did this when I was younger. And it caused a lot of closet clutter. So I decided to make a few rules for myself: 1. Limit the new outfit occasions to a small number of occasions. (Like my birthday! Or maybe holiday season).  2. Make myself wear said item 3 additional times during the year.  For all of the next occasions.  Like my b-day dress will be the wedding outfit. And going out outfit. Any for going to a play. And maybe even work depending on what I decide to get.	episode_done:True
text:Anyone here has the habit of needing to buy a new clothing/set of clothings when attending an occasion/going somewhere?	labels:I do the opposite. I’ll have a favorite outfit that I’ll wear like every special occasion. It’s gotten to the point that I’m looking at pictures and thinking “What holiday even was that?” I have been switching it up a bit more this past year, but I definitely still rewear outfits all the time.

text:Anyone here has the habit of needing to buy a new clothing/set of clothings when attending an occasion/going somewhere?	labels:Yes! I am so guilty of this.  But then I started to invest in quality blank canvas outfits and use accessories to change them up. So I have a great black cocktail dress that I wear all the time. But I might wear long strings of pearls and gold heels to one event and then the next event swap in red heels and a big gold statement necklace with a red lip. I have cocktail dresses in dark gray, navy, wine and gold and just layer in accessories, shoes and bags to change the look. And if I REALLY want something new, I buy some inexpensive accessory instead of an entire new outfit.  My exceptions are my birthday and our annual family Christmas party. Those are the two times I treat myself. But for all those other weddings, cocktail parties and work events, I stick to my tried and true.	episode_done:True
text:Anyone here has the habit of needing to buy a new clothing/set of clothings when attending an occasion/going somewhere?	labels:Yeah its especially an issue with weddings because I don't want to be wearing the same dress in pictures from each.

text:Anyone here has the habit of needing to buy a new clothing/set of clothings when attending an occasion/going somewhere?	labels:I do sometimes, but I’ve been buying primarily secondhand (Poshmark, Depop, thrift stores, friends, Instagram, etc) for going on three years now.   I like trading out items with other people too, that way I’m not contributing to consumerism, but also getting that variety I crave!	episode_done:True
text:Anyone here has the habit of needing to buy a new clothing/set of clothings when attending an occasion/going somewhere?	labels:I was in the habit of thinking I need something new when attending a fancy event like a wedding. I would then donate the items. Nowadays, even before COVID, I wasn't getting invited to much so I don't have this problem anymore. In the future, I plan on wearing the same things again. If I thought I could get things that fit well in my size and don't need tailoring, I would rent instead.	episode_done:True

text:Anyone have a job that requires you to wear "work clothes" (nursing, trades, etc.)? What is your off-duty wardrobe like?	labels:I work in a food safety lab, so we have to wear lab coats, uniforms, and even specific shoes. My off-duty wardrobe is, like everyone else's in our position, larger than it needs to be.  But since I live in a colder climate, I've gotten really into outerwear like coats & scarfs since that's the one thing I can control every single day on my way to and from work!  When I first started in my lab, I didnt want to put on a whole new outfit when I got home because I'm lazy and hate doing laundry.  But after a while, I got to the point where I just wanted to feel cute and like myself! These days I basically change outfits entirely in the evening when I get home just to have a little style in my day.  I also started wearing my "special occasion" clothes more regularly too since when else are we gonna wear them?!  Last night I wanted to look cute but didnt want to put any effort into it, so I put on a chiffon tank top and cozy sweater with nice leggings.  And you know what - I felt fancy as fuck sitting on my couch eating burritos with my husband.  I've decided that it's just about finding that balance between needing to feel put together at some point during your day/life, and how much effort you want to put in.	episode_done:True
text:Anyone have a job that requires you to wear "work clothes" (nursing, trades, etc.)? What is your off-duty wardrobe like?	labels:About a year ago I moved from a front office position wearing business casual to a medical billing position where I am required to wear scrubs. I can’t stand it. My entire business wardrobe is packed away but my personal wardrobe only gets worn on the weekends. It’s very opposite of scrubs. I like tighter denim and leggings, lots of structured tops and leather jackets. Every time I go shopping I have this voice in the back of my mind reminding me that I am hardly ever going to wear that so there’s no point but I refuse to listen to that guilt. I love clothes and I get excited for the changing seasons.	episode_done:True
text:Anyone have a job that requires you to wear "work clothes" (nursing, trades, etc.)? What is your off-duty wardrobe like?	labels:I work in a medical lab, so it’s scrubs and a lab coat all day. On my days off I dress nice and do my makeup even if I don’t leave the house. I play dress up with my daughter with my nicer clothing so it doesn’t just sit in the closet until it’s safe to go out again. It feels good to be put together and not just wear sweatpants all day, even if we’re stuck home.	episode_done:True
text:Anyone have a job that requires you to wear "work clothes" (nursing, trades, etc.)? What is your off-duty wardrobe like?	labels:I am a vet tech so scrubs with pet fur and pet bodily functions on myself all day. When I get home, usually it’s a lot of sweat pants and comfy T-shirts that feel clean until pajama time. But I definitely love to have those days were I dress up and look presentable, but that’s mostly just jeans and a nice top/sweater in winter or a sundress in summer. I have an addiction to formal dresses so although I won’t have a use for one for a while in COVID, having those gorgeous dresses in my closet makes my heart full. I say get what makes you feel confident and happy, whether or not you’ll wear it every day or once a month.	episode_done:True
text:Anyone have a job that requires you to wear "work clothes" (nursing, trades, etc.)? What is your off-duty wardrobe like?	labels:Mechanic here (yeah, a dude in female fashion advise, I know). Get greasy and filthy daily but have always had a more business casual/preppy style out of work. I'll wear polo shirts on the weekend even when I'm puttering around the house and nice sweaters in the evening. As others have said, lots of out of date clothes in my closet but as a guy that matters a lot less. I like to look good and always dress for or above the occasion. Bright side is: I spend VERY little money on clothes because they last so long. Jeans? 10 years easily. Graphic T's? 5+ years, no problem. Buy the things you love and don't worry about the money because the clothes will outlive your memory of the cost.  Added bonus, my wife and I go places together and look like we own the place. Every night is a date night!	episode_done:True
text:Anyone have a job that requires you to wear "work clothes" (nursing, trades, etc.)? What is your off-duty wardrobe like?	labels:Security here.   My non-work wardrobe is extensive and colourful and very 1950s.  I don't like wearing my security uniform into work unless it's freezing cold and I can hide it under a winter coat, because it's made by the same uniform supplier as our local PD.   So I end up wearing most of my clothes anyways, because I don't want to be mistaken for something I'm not.      Plus i've had incidents where people threaten to wait outside for me after I get off work (because I've kicked them out, or caught them stealing) and I've walked right by them and they have NO IDEA because I look so different in my regular clothes.   So it's a safety thing too.	episode_done:True
text:Anyone have a job that requires you to wear "work clothes" (nursing, trades, etc.)? What is your off-duty wardrobe like?	labels:I work in healthcare as well and wear scrubs to work.  I find that since I dress down on a daily basis, I tend to want to dress up a bit more when I’m not at work - heels, dresses, etc.  That being said, my wardrobe in general is fairly casual since I really have no need to business clothing.	episode_done:True
text:Anyone have a job that requires you to wear "work clothes" (nursing, trades, etc.)? What is your off-duty wardrobe like?	labels:I work for the local parks department in the summer and as a baker in the winter. So my summer job has a uniform and my winter job I have to wear more grungy clothes that can be in a kitchen. This winter I decided fuck it, I wanna look a little nicer at work so I have been wearing clothes that are a bit nicer for me and making sure I always have an apron over them. Otherwise I just have a lot of stuff that will rarely get used. Before covid I loved dressing nicer to go out to dinner or a brewery or even to a friends, but now when I’m not at work I mostly wear sweats and leggings. Just waiting for covid to end so I can at least look nice out and about again because I never will at my jobs haha	episode_done:True
text:Anyone have a job that requires you to wear "work clothes" (nursing, trades, etc.)? What is your off-duty wardrobe like?	labels:I ride horses professionally and manage a boarding facility, so my daily wear has to be appropriate for riding 8 horses a day (so breeches, knee high socks, athletic shirts), getting dirty (mud boots, overclothes I don't much care about), and staying warm/dry (seven billion layers of hobo coats). Unfortunately, my personal style is more of a mix of cottagecore/Edwardian/grungy Audrey Hepburn, which as you can imagine has absolutely no place whatsoever in my day to day life. I am also a compulsive clothes hoarder (screw you, Goodwill and thrift shopping!)  &#x200B;  I got sick and tired of seeing all these beautiful clothes in my closets that I *never* wore, so I purged it completely. I have two to three outfits for every occasion, two pairs of going - out jeans, and one pair of black heels now, with the ability to mix and match in between. Since I never really go anywhere, I always feel like I'm wearing something new when I do! Most of my pieces are more or less "timeless styles," and then I try and get one new thing every season to keep my wardrobe up with the times. But I have a rule that every time I buy a new thing, I have to throw one item out, which helps with the clothes hoarding!   &#x200B;  Luckily, I have some room for fashion in my work wear. I try and get trendy colored breeches in earth tones, find complementary shirts and jackets, cool socks, etc. I also have the awesome opportunity to color coordinate with my horse *and* his tack, which most people can't say, so I'll take that over being truly fashionable any day! (Did you guys know it's actually pretty difficult to pick a color scheme that also complements the exact shade of your horses coat properly? It's hard enough to determine whether humans are cool or warm or whatever....)	episode_done:True
text:Anyone have a job that requires you to wear "work clothes" (nursing, trades, etc.)? What is your off-duty wardrobe like?	labels:I work in an investment firm - no sandals, shorts or anything that remotely looks like a pajama.   I wear a nice tanktop at home with my nice pair of VS panty. I love feeling sexy at home. Sometimes bra or not. My BF loves to see me in nice panties. At other times when I am going out to see friends - I wear what I wear at work. I have no other varieties.	episode_done:True
text:People who've been working from home for most of 2020 - do you think your work style will change when you go back to the office (compared to your work wardrobe pre-lockdown)? If so, how?	labels:I am a teacher that went back to working in the building at the beginning of September, so to be fair I was only wfh for several months in the spring, but it still drastically changed my style, or my perspective on my style.   Pre-Covid my work style (and general style) had morphed over the years to become very, very minimal and neutral. Lots of Everlane and Eileen Fisher. This was both because I wanted to be taken seriously at my job (I read very young) and because it also seemed like what was in style to me.   Returning to work in the fall, I realized I really f*cking hated all of my sensible, plain, go with everything black and grey clothes.   I still really prefer earth tones and blacks and greys, and I still wear some pretty simple outfits somedays, but I went on a small spree on The RealReal after I had my realization. I bought myself some louder statement pieces that feel more me, including an embroidered Happy Sheep sweater, a knit Missoni sheath dress, a multi-colored leather and fur purse, platform oxfords, and a couple of geometric patterned silk shirts and dresses.   For me life is too short to try so hard to be timeless and professional. I’m not knocking the look, it just isn’t ~me~ I want to love the clothes I wear and the clothes I love are fun knits and patterns.
text:I also have added a lot more prints/textures/silhouettes/colors to my wardrobe since COVID. I am wondering if this is because I've had more time to take a deep dive into what my style actually is or if it's because trends are moving away from the all neutral "timeless" look.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:I have kind of done this over the fall as well...  In the last few years I wore so much black- black shirts,  black leggings....every day.   Since I had to wear all black for work  the only nice things I bought for myself were black...  I just got so sick of it I started craving color. So I have kind of been on a spree but only for things with color, pattern, LIFE!  Life is too short to just live in neutrals	labels:	episode_done:True

text:People who've been working from home for most of 2020 - do you think your work style will change when you go back to the office (compared to your work wardrobe pre-lockdown)? If so, how?	labels:I have been working from home in sweatpants and leggings since March and will WFH until at least summer 2021.   I miss going to the office and feeling cute, and being seen by others. A woman I work with told me ‘you always have the cutest dresses’ about a year ago and I absolutely loved hearing that. I’ve learned in quarantine that I don’t dress for myself, I dress for other people.   I’ll probably dress up a bit more when I can go back and wear more lipstick, since I’ve been in comfy slouch mode for so long.
text:I’m exactly the same. I had a Rent the Runway unlimited membership that I used mainly for playing around with my work style. There were stretches of weeks if not months where I don’t think I wore any of my own clothes. I would legit be a little disappointed if I didn’t get some sort of comment about my outfit every day.   I’m not going back until at least next September and RTR Unlimited is going away so I have no idea what my style will be when I go back.   I definitely have very little motivation to put on anything other than leggings and cardigans right now.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:This so much!  I love getting compliments, and it's easier to complement "fun" things. If I show up in a blue dress with little birds on it, It will get compliments.   A much more stylish blouse and pants with killer heels? It will look great, but no one compliment the perfect black pants.  At home with a dark office and shitty camera, I wear knitted joggers and cardigans with tight tops, like heattech. I'm really happy about trading most sweatpants for knitted versions, even though it's mostly synthetics. I find my legs are sensitive to wool.	labels:	episode_done:True

I’m sick of seeing all these clothes in my closet.  I’ll dress more comfortable too. I can’t picture myself in dresses and tights anymore for my kind of job.

I have been going to my workout class and it feels silly to change clothes midday to get ready for an afternoon class. I would bring a change of clothes before of course.   One of my fashion goals for this year was getting better at separates. I am practicing this! In the before times I wore more dresses. I haven’t been doing it as much because my desk area is a little chilly. I have a few looks I am happy with and should translate nicely.   I did wear some of my dresses during the summer. But more solid ones vs patterned ones. I have been also experimenting with solids this year.   I have been wearing way more pants so that will likely translate in the future. Surprisingly. I have avoided pants a lot in the past.   I can’t wait to get back to my fave shoes and the dresses I have missed - that feel a little wrong for sitting at home. My wardrobe has gone through a massive shift over the past 5 years when I started biking for errands.  This means I mostly buy items that are bike friendly. And that works well for sitting at home as well.

text:Bodysuits better than skims (important)	labels:I have never worn a contour bodysuit and I am interested! Is this purely shapewear or can you wear it as an actual garment? How do you style it?
text:Contour is just the name of the bodysuit line from the brand! It’s more of just an actual garment instead of shape wear since the material is not as super stretch but it is definitely very slimming and hugging. I typically wear it as an easy basic top, it can be dressed up with a nice pair of high waist pants, heels, and mid length coat. I’ll dress is down with slim sweats and a long sleeve crew bodysuit and white sneakers just to look cozy comfy but still decently put together	labels:Aaah I get you! I thought they were like special shapewear bodysuits haha. They look fantastic though so I'm glad to have the recommendation - a great basic layer like this always makes a difference!	episode_done:True
text:Bodysuits better than skims (important)	labels:Good to know! I have been interested in SKIMS but it is pretty pricey. So I’m assuming you would say this one is worth the cost? Also, how’s the sizing would you say it’s true to size or size up?
text:definitely worth the cost. I found out about contour bodysuits maybe a month ago and I already own 5. I would say it’s pretty true to size but I would size up for the crewneck styles only because the armpit isn’t stretchy which makes it harder to get out of. If you want a skin tight fit, I would go with regular size and just take into account you’ll have to be patient at the end of the day getting it off or have someone help you.   The scoop, strapless and any that have a bigger neck is tts and stretches and you can slip in and out easily through the neck.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Dressing larger bodies - without looking sloppy	labels:I think you have to have one element that “fits.”  Like of you have the oversized thing, pick one thing that fits a little slimmer (e.g a straight pant over a wide pant).   Or make sure the shoulder fits for that oversized top - vs a drop shoulder - if the whole outfit is looser.   I also think you can be intentional about revealing a little bit of well chosen skin. Wrists, ankles, calves, collarbone. So you are not just overwhelmed by fabric.   And of course you can always just wear what you want and not worry about it.	episode_done:True
text:Dressing larger bodies - without looking sloppy	labels:This style isn’t really my style, but one thing I notice in these looks is that they look really well tailored despite being loose and drapey. In particular, the cuff of the sleeves in the first pic and the hem of the pants in the second hit in exactly the right places rather than bunching up. This makes the outfits look really intentional IMO.	episode_done:True
text:Dressing larger bodies - without looking sloppy	labels:I think what's consistent in the examples that you've shown is that she has a very minimalist style in darker colors. The quality of the fabric appears to be high. When you use natural fibers like cotton and wool and silk they will naturally drape better on any body type. Look for pieces like cocoon jackets, cropped wide leg trousers, and tunics for example. I hope this helps, I love the images you've selected. last thought is that if you are going to accessorize keep it somewhat simple and also high quality.	episode_done:True
text:Dressing larger bodies - without looking sloppy	labels:I work retail and I see a lot of customers who are plus-size/large wearing oversize pieces and they make it work. It really is about attitude and also as a user below said, having your hair, makeup and nails done is really helpful too.  *I don't dress to disguise my body shape, I'm OK with looking fat.*  Also wanted to add that I relate to that sentiment. Having this attitude has helped me so much in not agonizing over what to wear to work every day. I know I'm not proportionate and I'm not going to try and disguise it with shapewear. It is what it is.	episode_done:True
text:Dressing larger bodies - without looking sloppy	labels:I’d add that the most *important* fit for these clothes are the shoulders. Whatever top you choose, the drape will be affected by what is primarily holding the weight of the fabric. You could experiment with different fits in your shoulders and see what flattering drapes occur on your body.
text:You know, I've noticed that too. Great tip!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Dressing larger bodies - without looking sloppy	labels:This goes for any size, but I think the oversized/shapeless trend is done well with styling.  Perfectly tailored items, luxe fabrics, and generally styling yourself to look polished (hair, makeup, jewelry, whatever your thing is) really helps avoid looking or feeling sloppy.  I really enjoy loose tops, and find if they have a nice drape it helps. I'm short, so I try to offset the volume up top by wearing something slim on the bottom.	episode_done:True
text:Dressing larger bodies - without looking sloppy	labels:>and like Grandma's ashamed of her weight gain on fat people.  People wear what they like. Wearing lose clothing does not mean grandma is trying to hide weight gain or is ashamed. It is obviously prescriptive and repressive to say fat people need to hide fat "or wearing "flattering clothes", but if they are wearing some loose maybe they just like it? We do not have to wear body fitting clothing to be OK, or proud with our bodies, sometimes you know you just like the silhouette, the cut, the comfort.  Grandma can wear whatever she wants and she is not necessarily ashamed.	episode_done:True

text:This old thing? / Too cool to care / No effort but excellent style?	labels:I like to add a nice blazer over those good unembellished plain staples, for example a nice white t-shirt and classic jeans, and the blazer instantly elevates my look. And depending where I'm going, say casual like to the grocery store or simple errands but I still want to look polished, I'll slip on a pair of classic loafers or slides (something easy to walk in), put on a pair of classic gold hoop earrings, dab on some red lipstick to just stain my lips, and refresh my mascara.

I saw it a few days ago in someone's instagram and I think it's amazing you show your cute shirts but you don't get a cold in the process! 3) Accessories. I went through all the accessories obsessions, it started with earnings, I would change them daily (I need to wear always earrings), then it went to rings and I felt like a influencer. I do not know why wearing rings made me feel like such a badass it would give me like I do not why as if I had my life together and with a cute manicure wow.... but I am not that constant so I started forgetting changing earrings and putting rings. Then I started with multiple small necklaces and as with earrings and rings, oh and purses, I stopped doing it and nowI just wear the same three necklace always... so... now I am obsessed with belts, I promise I have tried with all my strength to go out of my house without a belt, but I really can't I would say that it is as if I was going without a bad but I do that a lot ....but without a belt puff I can't.	episode_done:True

text:Does anyone else always hesitate to buy what they truly love because they don't have a social life?	labels:I try to reach a compromise: one of the questions I ask myself before buying something is “will I wear it?” I’ve learnt that I don’t really need more dresses, but what does make me feel good is really good quality staples that make day to day clothes stand out more, like a special coat, shoes or earrings. For you, you might want to explore making your jeans, tees and athleisure really good quality so they make you feel good about them when you put them on.  Another way of looking at it is you probably save more money than the average person on going out. You could set aside some money every month for special items of clothing, then try buying and wearing that fancy dress or expensive jeans you mentioned - it’s much easier to treat yourself on clothes when it’s designated in your budget. The more you wear them, the more you’ll probably see there are opportunities in your life to show them off.	episode_done:True

text:You make a great point about quality variances across all fibers. Even though I prefer natural fibers I have definitely eschewed linen pants from target because it's low quality, see through, and scratchy. I also hate how sometimes a cotton tee warps after washing because it wasn't prewashed prior to being cut and seen but that has more to do with the production of the garment rather than the fiber content, but it's still an example that not all natural fiber items are great (if not made well).	labels:	episode_done:True

text:I totally agree, but to be honest one caveat I find when shopping online is that if it's multiple materials that's usually (but not always) a sign of it being higher quality. 100% polyester is sketch unless it's like intended to be shiny sports-clothes material, but 99% polyester 1% something else is more likely to be a bit better for some reason	labels:Agree!

text:Synthetics in Our Wardrobe	labels:Rayon is made from cellulose, a plant based fibre  While yes, polyester is a synthetic   It seemd the less synthetics worn and used the better, as yes fibre shedding in the wash is an issue.  It is proven, that synthetics will grow a bacterium, that cottons, linen, wools, canvas etc will not. So you need to wash synthetics more. As everyone knows from gym clothes and swimwear.  Plus the cling and static of synthetics not so nice.  Also synthetics textiles used for so many textile things around us daily life, that aren’t clothing, but were we are adding them in rubbish all the time and they pollution, and materials that won’t breakdown.  So choosing more natural fibre clothing helps balance out our excess use of synthetic fibres in day to day life, and feels better on body.
text:Yup I love Rayon and it does not have the shedding microplastics issue since it's made from plant material	labels:Each material has their own downside. Rayon uses a lot of trees (deforestation) and the chemical process to manufacture Rayon is pretty toxic for the environment.  Meanwhile cotton is a water hungry plant that kills the dirt's health. Plastic creates micropalstics like you said. It's almost like you can't win. But if you buy secondhand or deadstock new, it slightly better cause you're not putting new money into deforesting, pesticides, toxic chemical processes and such.  Linen / flax / hemp is technically the better choice to buy new. The plants require less water than cotton and doesn't have the plastic problem. Although any farming industry that gets big enough will eventually harm the environment one way or another.  It's really the insane commercialization of any manufacturing process that's bad for the environment. There isn't really any one magic material that's not going to harm the environment when it's mass produced for millions of people to consume.	episode_done:True

text:Oh right! I had forgotten about rayon being plant based.  True, the issue of synthetics isn't limited to fashion.

text:Synthetics in Our Wardrobe	labels:I don't like wearing synthetic fabrics for the most part and try to avoid them, but I am vegan and that leaves out wool and silk, so almost everything I own is cotton or linen. I find I sweat too much in most synthetic fabrics or they just cause weird sensory issues for me, but not all synthetic and blends are bad or cause me issues. It's hard because I generally need to feel the fabric to see if it'll cause me a problem and when ordering online, it's not possible.   I do think fleece is particularly problematic because of the plastic fibers that get into the water when washed, but there are bags to wash them in to trap it. I don't think all synthetics shed plastic like that but I'm not sure.	episode_done:True
text:Synthetics in Our Wardrobe	labels:I think its important to take into consideration that sure synthetic fibres are easier to acquire nowadays and its the ‘new’ thing to turnover plastic into these fabrics however, we need to think of biodegradability. Although these synthetic fibres are accessible they are not as easy to degrade into the earth as natural fibres. Look into this and think about it when shopping. I personally own items that are made of synthetic fabrics but have purchased them second hand so they are already pre-existing.  I feel grateful to have so many options accessible to me here in the GTA, so I now purchase about 90% of my clothing second hand.	episode_done:True
text:Synthetics in Our Wardrobe	labels:Depends on the synthetic for me - like OP said if it serves a purpose, I love them. I think there's also a huge spectrum of quality with synthetics that can either make it unbelievably comfy or a scratchy heat trap from hell (although tbf you run into the same thing with wool).  What does creep me out is you would not want to be caught in any type of fire related emergency while wearing the majority of fast fashion synthetics because they will melt into your skin and make burns worse.   I also avoid polyester as a hard rule always but thats because it gives me the worse BO and I smelled like chopped onions all day.

text:100% on privilege. Over the past few years, I’ve slowly transitioned much of my wardrobe to natural fiber clothing (with the exception of athletic wear - but now there’s recycled options at least!). And I know it’s a privilege to do so, now that I’m further in my career. A $300 slow fashion, locally produced w/ fair wage, pasture raised wool sweater simply isn’t accessible for most.

It’s interesting - I’m in my early 30s, so our generation was in jr high / high school just as e-commerce was starting. We were one of the first Facebook user cohorts. I grew up in a sleepy suburb that was ~2 hours from a large city. We had an OK mall, Macy’s was our fanciest department store.

text:How do you think access and privilege affect your taste and sense of style?	labels:Was just pondering this the other day, I have always had hand me downs and thrift store finds and other bonus items as my wardrobe. I still have people comment on my style and saying I'm stylish, but fashion and brand choices aren't an option. I make what I can get my hands on work. I hardly ever get rid of anything just in case it will work well with something I get in the future. I wear a lot of more outlandish stuff simply because people would notice how shitty my clothes are if I was trying to dress like everyone else. I'll often get an item of clothing or a pair of shoes as a big birthday present, but anything over £100 is out of my league. Even if I could save it up, there's no way I can justify spending that much of my budget on shiny clothes, especially since there's hardly ever anywhere to wear them!	episode_done:True
text:How do you think access and privilege affect your taste and sense of style?	labels:It's interesting for me to read other people's dislike of thrift clothes, and based on their stories I can see why. For me, thrift has been a different experience. When I was in middle school I hated it and unless it was Gap or something like that and you could not tell it was thrift AT ALL I'd refuse to wear what my mom got from a thrift store. I didn't really fit in with most of my peers. Not necessarily because of money, but mostly because I grew up kind of sheltered and then we moved to the DC area. I was suddenly teased because I liked to read and didn't wear Adidas or whatever. So for a long time I tried to fit in through clothes but it still never worked. I still didn't fit in. And I could never quite get the clothes right.  But as I got older I started wanting to differentiate myself from the other upper middle class kids I lived with (we weren't rich by any means but the DC area is an expensive place to live so I was privileged, even if it didn't feel like we had a lot). Thrift clothes were a way to do that that I could afford. Instead of wearing Abercrombie like all the other kids, which we couldn't really afford anyway, I chose to wear old men trousers and sweaters and weird T shirts from thrift shops. So thrift shopping became part of the control I had over my clothes in ways I didn't otherwise have. My "weird" choices were now *my* choice, rather than something I did because I couldn't afford anything else. And even if people thought it was weird that I wore ballet slippers and long wool skirts, it was a style I chose and honestly, I still am impressed by my teen style... sometimes. I like that I went for it and didn't care about how others perceived it.  I still think of thrift that way. And I've found stuff there that is unique and higher quality than I'd feel comfortable spending otherwise. I can experiment without feeling anxiety about how much I spend. And I really can't stand fast fashion, so there's that too.	episode_done:True

text:How do you think access and privilege affect your taste and sense of style?	labels:I have always been pretty comfortably middle class, but yes lack of physical access has changed my attitudes to shopping at least.   I grew up on a super remote island, and literally the only place to buy "new" clothes was the thrift store, so everyone was walking around in each other's clothes. I never associated second hand clothing with poverty until I moved to the city, so I still have an attitude of "I don't want this dress anymore, but it would look great on my friend so I'll offer it to her" which some people find very weird.   The lack of access to shops has also affected my attitude to shopping. I can't fathom shopping as a past time or getting much enjoyment out of the act of shopping. Clothes shopping (besides the thrift shop) was something we did on one day a year as part of our annual holiday off the island. Mum would drag us around hundreds of shops, trying on clothes and shoes and it was exhausting and high stress and built so many terrible memories that I now hate clothes shopping with a passion.	episode_done:True

text:Yes I agree with that - workplaces are getting more casual but any midriff skin is really a big no-no still. You really can’t have ANY midriff skin showing. If you love the overall shape you could wear a cami underneath so instead of a strip of skin you have a strip of cami.  I agree with the general advice to just wear boring things for a few weeks/months while you’re new and getting a feel for the overall vibe. There will almost certainly be a way to dress more interestingly and have fun with it, but there will be “ok” and “not ok” ways of doing that and you’ll need a bit of time to figure out what they are. A few months of dressing boringly isn’t a big deal in the scheme of things.	labels:Agree with this. I wear a lot of cropped shirts and cardigans, but it’s usually with a tank top or wife beater tucked into high waist slacks.	episode_done:True
text:How do you dress in a casual work environment if you really enjoy fashion/dressing up?	labels:start off your job dressing in line with the majority of the company, especially when you go back in person. during that time, strengthen your in-person connections with your coworkers and make yourself as indispensable at your job as you can. you'll also get to observe how people *actually* dress in the office as opposed to having mostly people's zoom outfits and the HR dress code to go off of.   once you have that strong foundation from both a performance standpoint and a team dynamics standpoint, then over time start integrating your typical style into your work style. pay attention to people's reactions to it, both direct and indirect, and scale back or plunge ahead accordingly.   this worked well for me and my style is pretty off the wall. it took about a year for me to feel secure enough in my role and on my team to wear renditions of "my style" to work all the time, and then an additional year to make the more 'permanent' choice to color my hair (i chose to also check with HR before i did this!). i also personally find that the overall aesthetic is what's most important to me, so the "just wear bizcaz but with fun earrings and socks" sort of advice that many people exchange on ffa is not relevant	episode_done:True
text:How do you dress in a casual work environment if you really enjoy fashion/dressing up?	labels: I don’t know that I have a unique style, but I remember my first office job where I could wear something more than the company assigned uniform. I was super excited too!    I would hold off on your shopping spree until you work in office for a bit. That way you can make sure what you buy not only incorporates your style, but is also something you feel comfortable wearing in an office setting.   I tend to work with an older, more conservative crowd but I am having a hard time picturing wearing crop tops in an office setting, maybe I am completely wrong, but I think you want to get the feel for working there (and how much effort you are realistically going to put into dressing up each day!) before you spend a lot of $$!	episode_done:True
text:How do you dress in a casual work environment if you really enjoy fashion/dressing up?	labels:When I’ve worked in places without much of a defined dress code, I’ve used two criteria to choose my clothes: 1) what clothing will allow me to do my work comfortably and 2) how do I want my supervisor/coworkers to think about me. When I worked in dead-end jobs in industries that I eventually planned to leave, I definitely leaned hard into dressing in a way that made me feel sexy because I wasn’t worried about my coworkers’ perception of me affecting my career advancement. Now that I’m in a job I care about and in which my career advancement depends on my supervisors’ and clients’ perception of me as competent, intelligent, and professional, I hew much more professional in my dress. Nonetheless, I express myself/my style by wearing a lot of skirts and dresses(usually knee-length) because I feel sexier in skirts and dresses than trousers. I wear stilettos most days and I try to choose blouses with a v-neck or a bateau neckline. I would characterize the gestalt as professional but youthful.   Since you are going to be one of the younger employees at your new job, I would recommend leaning more professional in your dress, especially during the first few months when people are getting to know you. Once people are confident in your abilities and your capacity to be a team player, then you can relax a little and incorporate more fun pieces into your work dress	episode_done:True
text:How do you dress in a casual work environment if you really enjoy fashion/dressing up?	labels:I have worked in casual places for the last few jobs now, and my motto is dress up but add one casual thing to dress it down or only have one dressy element per outfit.  That might mean wearing some sneakers with your fave dress. Wear your fancy skirt with a t-shirt or sweatshirt instead of a blouse. If you want to wear a blazer - make it a fun color, fun pattern, or softer less structured fabric. You wear your fancy trousers with a graphic tee and a jean jacket/leather jacket/chore jacket. You wear some vintage wash mom jeans with a t-shirt/boxy sweater and heels (or fancy boots).  This gives you one foot in casual, but gives you space to wear your favorites. And you do not feel ridiculously overdresses when your peers are wearing leggings and flannel shirts.  You also learn to go with it, and everyone thinks you are a dress up person.  These are my tips as a dressy person who works in casual Bay Area tech land.  And I'll chime in on the no crop tops if skin is visible! Not appropriate (although I know dress codes are loosening and people are doing it.... but it is a bad idea!).	episode_done:True
text:How do you dress in a casual work environment if you really enjoy fashion/dressing up?	labels:I used to work in an environment that was super casual. Because we had no dealings with the public, we could wear hoodies and sweatpants to work if we wanted to. I just wore whatever I wanted to. Some days that was jeans and a comfy shirt, other days it was heeled booties with a dressy blouse and vest. The only thing I kept in mind was what job I'd be doing that day. I floated around different departments, so I'd dress nicer on days I'd be mostly sitting, and I dressed more casual on days I'd be doing hard work in the shipping area. Other than that, I dressed however I wanted. I didn't mind standing out because I was dressed better than everyone else. I was also the youngest person there (I was 19, looking more like 14) so I figured people were already judging me for that, so might as well add judging me for dressing way better than they did in there. I did a good job and my work spoke for itself, so I didn't notice any real negative effects from my fashion choices. A few grumpy people probably thought I was some bougie millennial, but they were so miserable I'm sure they hate everything anyway.  &#x200B;  Edit: I also want to add that I agree with everyone else that crop tops are never appropriate for the office, no matter how casual the environment is.	episode_done:True
text:How do you dress in a casual work environment if you really enjoy fashion/dressing up?	labels:I would suggesting even wearing a more business causal version of your current style and then fine tuning it from there. You always want to look nice on your first day/week and rather be over dress than underdress.   I also feel like if you set the bar too low, when you do start dressing up it becomes more noticeable than when you start dressing down. In experience people are less likely to point out how causal you look but the will point out when you dress up. It's not usually ill-will, more like oh do you have a special event or whatever later?   We have a pretty casual office and we have a lot of people in varying function and formality. We have a lot of jeans and tees, but we also have people in button downs&slacks, dresses and heels, etc. Also literally, we had a guy on campus that wore a wizard hat all the time. At the end of the day, no one really cares.	episode_done:True
text:How do you dress in a casual work environment if you really enjoy fashion/dressing up?	labels:You’re clothes don’t sound less business like than anyone else’s just more dressed up and like you’re more interested in fashion. To me that’s the only thing that may make them take you less seriously, they may think that because you put effort into your outfits you’re shallow or superficial etc. So otherwise as long as you don’t mind standing out I’d wear what you want to wear. (Minus the crop tops like people have mentioned). I’m always overdressed and I don’t think it’s negatively affected me at work.	episode_done:True
text:What to do when nothing fits you properly?	labels:First, I do have some questions for you:    Which kind of items would you like to wear?   What style would you like to go towards? (I can't get much information from jeans and basic t-shirt)   Do you have a small waist? (this question goes towards if pants/jeans that fit you in the butt and thighs have a wide gap at the waist)   Are your legs "too long" for normal-sized bottoms? (regarding if you need tall sizes for jeans)   With your chest and shoulders, do you often have the issue that you need to size up to have correct shoulder hems but then the clothing item will be too wide in the chest/belly area?  Once you answer, I can give you some suggestions.
text:Oh, and the country you're in would be helpful too, to suggest some stores.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What to do when nothing fits you properly?	labels:Clothing doesn’t fit most people off the rack.  Each brand has a fit model and proportions in mind that likely do not match you.  Clothes should fit you. You shouldn’t need to mold yourself to fit them. So with that in mind - find ways and places to get the fit adjusted to suit you.   1. The way if fits off the rack isn’t the end all of the fit journey - tailoring is your friend. Many things can be adjusted to fit you and your proportions  2. Figure out what you want to accentuate and deaccentuate.  This will guide you on to shapes to start with as a base.  3. Some brands will be a lot closer to fitting you than others.  And one brand that works for pants might be terrible for shirts and vice versa. Trial and error is important.  4. Find a body twin to get inspiration from.	episode_done:True
text:What to do when nothing fits you properly?	labels:I sometimes YouTube people with my similar size and watch reviews on certain clothing/items before I purchase them. I think it would help to find fashionistas with your similar body/taste to start.  Taking measurements is also really helpful!!! I bought a dress online for the first time using measurements and I was very happy with how well the dress fit. It's soooo much more accurate than just going off small/medium/large sizes.  I also want to add that, at least for me, my clothing and fashion sense was *extremely* awkward (and at times unflattering) at 21. It's a bit of a strange age because you're transitioning from being a teenager to being a "young adult". The way you express your identity can change radically from teenage to young adulthood to adulthood. So I guess I bring this up to say that it is totally normal to be frustrated with your clothing at this age. People on social media will typically post themselves looking their best; please know that they too have days where their outfit doesn't look right, where they feel insecure. Fashion is ultimately a never ending process of learning and expressing one's identity as we age and grow.	episode_done:True
text:What to do when nothing fits you properly?	labels:I’m also 5’8” and pear shaped! Old navy tall sizes are cheap and decent for the price. I’m the same height so it’s that awkward “not quite tall enough to justify going to specialty online only sizes” but it really helps with finding shirts that cover your torso easily or jeans that fit better. You need more material to cover longer limbs. And don’t be afraid to get a tape measure and figure out inches to buy the right size in a particular brand. A bruised ego is better than a lifetime of ill fitting clothes.  Also learn to accept wide shoulders and other large frame bone structure things. I lost a lot of weight recently and just for fun tried to fit into a size six blazer. Nope felt like Chris Farley “fat man in a little coat.” Even at a thinner weight, gotta wear a size ten blazer at least to cover my shoulders. My feet are size ten at my thinnest. Accepting that has made life easier  and honestly height has a lot of advantages like being able to gain ten pounds without a big difference in appearance  or eat more calories from day to day.  Try to dress around the parts you like the most, show some skin or neckline a bit (even a v neck is more flattering), show arms, dress in dark colors on the bottom. Dresses look good on most body types even if it’s out of your comfort zone, I actually recommend Jersey or sweater dresses or something that stretches. Might be the easiest way to get a good fit without shelling out money on a tailor.	episode_done:True
text:What to do when nothing fits you properly?	labels:I’m an inch shorter than you and weight the exact same and I’d also describe myself as pear shaped so I’m guessing we look similar. My main problems have always been pants due to my height and shape: they’re too tight in the thigh, too short, or if they are a good length and fit my thighs, the waist is baggy. A few tips I’ve picked up at 24: You are now an adult, with an adults body so clothes from shops geared towards teens are going to fit weird. This is because they weren’t designed for your body not because your body is weird. (Young teens who shop there are often still in children’s sizes or are just barely out of them so the sizing is going to skew really small), if you are shopping there, don’t panic if you can’t fit into the size you think you are. The clothes are essentially made for kids.  At stores geared towards young adult women its easier to find pants that are labeled “curvy” which are not the same as “plus-sized.” it usually means the waist is cut smaller proportionally to the hip/thigh area, which is what you’re going to want to look for.  Look for pants that have longer inseams. Sometimes this will be labeled as “tall” I did not think i was tall enough to buy “tall” pants but pants that are meant to hit at the ankle always hit at my mid calf. Sometimes they are a little long but i think cuffed pants are cute so idc.	episode_done:True
text:What to do when nothing fits you properly?	labels:Other people have covered the main points- find fashion bloggers or icons that look like you; buy from companies where people post reviews with pictures, so you can see how it looks on someone with a similar body type; don't be intimidated to go to a tailor, or tailor your own clothes (youtube has plenty of tutorials on how to do basic alterations!).  Please don't take this as intending to trivialize your struggles, but rather an effort to offer some validation: off the rack clothes don't really fit *most* people well. I have friends of all different body types and sizes, and we *all* struggle to find clothes that work for us off the rack. So please know that you're not having trouble because your body is somehow uniquely unsuitable for clothes. It's because, quite frankly, *most* clothing is badly cut and designed. Most clothing sucks. Clothing manufacturers, especially since the 2008 recessions (i.e. most of your life), have been making clothing that just gets weirder and boxier and less flattering with every passing year. It's almost impossible to find things that fit anyone (in the sense of being flattering), because they are made to fit everyone (in the sense of doing the bare minimum of technically covering the body). Instead of manufacturing clothes to fit a human body, with all its curves and variations, it's *way* cheaper and easier to sew a couple rectangles together and call it a shirt. And we don't really have better options, so we buy it, so they keep making it. And it may feel like other people don't struggle with this, but you're not seeing them in the dressing rooms or looking through their closets in the morning. You're seeing them out and about, or on social media, where everything is carefully clipped and styled, staged to look perfect and effortless.	episode_done:True
text:What to do when nothing fits you properly?	labels:The question I will pose is: Are you dressing with your shape or are you dressing against it?  The reason I ask is because when I was younger, I soooo badly wanted to dress in a style that was more suited to completely different body shape. I bought clothes that didn’t fit right trying to make myself look like a different shape and obviously it didn’t work. It also made me feel like a failure and that my features were undesirable. When I stopped fighting my shape, I found more clothes that fit better and made me feel more confident.     But they only fit better, so I have my clothes altered to fit correctly or alter them myself. I mostly buy secondhand and go for things that are high quality, so that alterations are a possibility and worthwhile. It’s much easier to make something smaller than to let it out.	episode_done:True

text:What to do when nothing fits you properly?	labels:I would suggest going to a stylist at a store like Nordstrom. You don’t have to buy. But have an expert listen to you and find things that are flattering for your body type. In fact, I’d suggest trying this with two stylists so you get different perspectives. If you still find fault with how you look in those clothes, perhaps you’re being too hard on yourself and your appearance. Good luck.	episode_done:True
text:What to do when nothing fits you properly?	labels:The clothing examples will be dated because the book was published in the early 2000s, but Trinny Woodall and Susannah Constantine’s “What Not To Wear” talks about similar body types—minus broad shoulders and long legs. I’m short and have a different body type, so I won’t be much help here, but checking out Trinny and Susannah’s book might be helpful to get ideas of general clothing cuts that might work for you. They also have a series of YouTube videos called “The Rules” which repeat a lot of what’s in the book. I hope this helps!	episode_done:True
text:How do I feel sexy at home in winter?	labels:matching bra and panties. it works wonders. I do this in the summer too (on summer bra days, which with boob sweat there are not many). when I buy a new bra, I typically get 2-3 coordinating panties in different styles so I have some options, and then put them together under all my clothes. I swear there's a posture change when I'm wearing ratty underclothes vs nice ones. even if no one sees it, I know it's there.
text:Second this. Pretty sleep clothes also. I've been wearing ripped leggings, non matching underwear, an old shirt, and not shaving for months now and I feel terrible lol. I got a silky cami set earlier in the year and a chiffon one with long pants and felt so nice. Could get a little chilly, but a nice blanket helped. Even just taking care of yourself(hygiene,skin,keeping up old routines, exercise, etc) helps me during winter. Treat yourself like you're sexy and you'll feel it.	labels:	episode_done:True

I just got one from UpWest, but you can google matching lounge sets and you’ll find a bunch. You can also get a cute long cardigan to throw over the matching set, and wear a nice pair of fluffy slippers (I like mini uggs or LLbean moccasins.   Do your hair and makeup, and wear perfume that reminds you of winter. You can also get a cute beanie that matches your set, Uniqlo has cashmere ones for $30.   Hope this helps!

text:What’s the comfiest material you can put in a washing machine without fuss?	labels:Cotton would probably be the least fussy sweater material that still feels nice. Any wool/cashmere you would have to at least wash it on gentle and air dry. Acrylic and polyester is uncomfortable	episode_done:True
text:What’s the comfiest material you can put in a washing machine without fuss?	labels:I just got some insanely soft velvet leggings from Old Navy and they're machine washable.  &#x200B;  I machine wash a lot of things that say to hand wash only, but I make sure they're inside out and I only use cold water on all of my clothes.	episode_done:True
text:What’s the comfiest material you can put in a washing machine without fuss?	labels:Rayons. You can absolutely put them in the dryer, they're less prone to pilling than cotton and definitely much softer. If you do put them in the dryer, just use the lowest setting (which you should already be doing for all your clothing - high heat settings on washers and dryers should only be used for things like towels and sheets). Air drying is, obviously, less hard on *all* clothing and so you should opt for it whenever possible to extend the life of your clothing, but I wouldn't say it's *necessary* for rayons. They don't need to be dried flat, so a laundry rack or hanging them to dry in some other way is totally fine. I don't hand wash anything, either, tbh. I put delicates in a wash bag and wash all clothing in cold water on the delicate cycle, but that's about as far as I'm willing to go. I pretty much exclusively wear soft/smooth fabrics due to sensory issues, and that works well enough for me.	episode_done:True
text:What’s the comfiest material you can put in a washing machine without fuss?	labels:For an actual sweater, cotton but I don’t find cotton all that comfortable (the soft ones are thin and don’t keep me warm, and the warm ones are really heavy and knobbly (they leave indents in my elbows when I’m sitting at a desk because of the texture idk this is just my experience tho)  There are washable wools now so you could look into those too.	episode_done:True
text:What’s the comfiest material you can put in a washing machine without fuss?	labels:I love Supima or Pima cotton and modal. Preferably a blend of both! It's the smoothest soft knit blend. You can get tees made out of this fabric at L.l. Bean, Lands' End, etc.	episode_done:True

My mom dries her cashmere sweaters on medium heat and has never had any issues either	episode_done:True
text:What’s the comfiest material you can put in a washing machine without fuss?	labels:Columbia makes super soft and cozy 100% cotton knit sweaters that are machine-washable.   I actually find my merino sweaters faster to hand wash. I use Eucalan, which doesn’t require rinsing. Soak them in the sink with Eucalan for a half hour, wring out, roll in a towel to take downstairs to the drying rack, dry flat. It takes the same amount of time as finding the mesh delicates bags, washing on delicate, being nervous that I’ve ruined them, and drying flat.	episode_done:True

I work in healthcare and live in a politically mixed area, and everyone is automatically friendly to me.   Con: People assume I'm straight. So if I mention my fiancée people assume she's male, and if her pronouns come up I have to have this whole awkward interaction where (at best) they go "Oh--she??? Ohhhhh" and then look me up and down, awkwardly change the subject or ask me invasive questions, and stop being so friendly with me. Also, men hit on me, and women never hit on me.

text:Evidently, I present as “an upper middle class lesbian” (quote stolen from a FFAer). I’m not but whatever. Assume away. Clothing style is a combo of conservative/traditional New England/androgynous except for shoes ;-)  Pros: Was never sexually harassed at work.

text:What’s something you wish you could tell clothing manufacturers to do differently?	labels:More jackets with inside pockets.  More raglan sleeves and fewer drop-shoulder sleeves. I prefer a regular shoulder seam, but I think a raglan sleeve looks better than drop sleeves while also making for a more forgiving fit than a regular seam.  This isn't really a manufacturing issue but I wish they'd just size men's and women's shoes the same in the US--an 8 should be a certain number of in/cm rather than changing with the shoe's "gender."  I saw a couple comments about more elastic in clothing and I think this is actually way more common than it was 10-15 years ago because of the effect of the athleisure trend (and it's probably cheaper). It used to be that elastic waists were common in clothing marketed toward older women, plus size women, and young children, but they weren't standard and it was supposed to be embarrassing if you wore elastic-waist pants.
text:I agree with you about everything except the sleeves, I personally would like to throw all raglan sleeves into a fire, and love a dropped sleeve. It’s all preference of course, I swam and rowed for years and have massive shoulders and am very self conscious about how raglans emphasize my shoulders.   Ditto on the elastic! I bought some fancy selvage (ie no stretch whatsoever) jeans and I a) can barely sit in them and b) cannot for the life of me fathom how I wore jeans prior to them containing spandex/elastin or some variety of stretch- I did, but I don’t know how.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What are your coziest winter finds/essentials?	labels:This year I've finally come to the realization that I can layer all the sweaters I want, I'm still going to feel cold if my legs are cold. So I got merino wool tights from Icebreaker (the 260 weight) to layer when I'm outdoors, as well as a couple of pairs of cheap "fur-lined" leggings for lounging at home (purchased from whatever Instagram brand advertised them to me first, I'm ashamed to admit). The wool tights are great of course, as expected, but the cheap leggings are a pleasant surprise! They fit decently although they're not as high-waisted as I would personally like, and they are definitely warm.	episode_done:True

text:What are your coziest winter finds/essentials?	labels:Definitely fleece-lined leggings/tights. I have a few in fun colours but also nude ones to wear under sheer tights to get that look but stay warm.  Waterproof lined, heeled boots (Ecco is great) are also a staple for me. If you can't tell, I like my skirts/dresses year-round so these two things keep me warm.	episode_done:True

text:why are men's clothing generally not as expensive and better quality?	labels:Planed obsolescence comes in to play. If the trend is over for the next season why make it last a year?  and adding to that is the cost of investment to change trends is higher for women with more possibilities with sizes and lot's of  inventory for each size. So the "Value"is in the changing for companys because it increases consumption but men don't have that.  For them if it falls apart or feels cheap they don't buy it and a shirt can last every season XD. So if it falls apart after a couple of months they are more likely to change brand for something of higher quality.  >>  >The lack of consumption and brand loyalty can lead to increase in quality with lack of differences and change cutting cost.	episode_done:True
text:why are men's clothing generally not as expensive and better quality?	labels:This makes me think of a conversation I had with my husband yesterday - he asked me (on my next run to the thrift store) to pick him up some track pants as his main pair have gotten a hole and it's too cold to run in shorts.  I told him he didn't want to wear thrift store track pants (I have spent many hours digging through the men's and women's sections in our local thrift stores for both of us).    Husband: why not?  Me: Let me put it this way.  Women tend to donate their clothes when they don't *want* them anymore. Men tend donate when they *can't* use them anymore.     Men's clothes don't change as much, and men tend to either wear them until they're ruined or they cannot use them (aka, they gain/lose weight, change jobs, have a spouse donate them, they move and can't store it etc).  So while you can still find good stuff if you really dig, there's way more staining, missing buttons, fading and wear on men's thrift clothes.      My usual score for husband at thrift stores is  (formerly) expensive cashmere and wool sweaters, and occasionally, high quality dress pants and shorts.  Nice jeans and regular shirts are hard to find, and this is probably related to the fact that others have pointed out - men can wear their clothes for 10+ years and still be moderately in style.    As for men's clothes that I wear - I never buy women's socks for work.  Always men's wool and cushioned socks.  Same with any kind of technical under layers for martial arts.  I like the women's designs better, but for some reason they assume the women have no boobs and I'll have 2-3 inches of stomach showing under a rash guard.  So I buy men's.	episode_done:True
text:why are men's clothing generally not as expensive and better quality?	labels:Women will pay more for their clothes, and pay more for nicer clothes than men will. Supply and demand, baby.
text:Supply and demand is a lie, it's like saying evolution has a plan. Sometimes things just turn to shit. If there is no one competing with great quality for fair prices, mediocre shit will rise to the top.  Companies might be 60% right on what the customer want. But they jack prices to compensate so they are still doing well. Like H&M burn a ton of clothes, but are still doing well, because they will profit if they sell 1 item for every 2 they burn.  Companies know the customer wants a dress with pockets in high quality, and it would sell well. BUT the profit margin would be much better on a shitty item with money spent on marketing rather then quality.  Small companies might make the perfect item, but they will be more expensive because of the small volumes, and more sensitive to a bad year. And can't afford marketing.  Women will buy shit if shit's the only thing offered. Men will wear their old stuff rather then buy shit.  Uniqlo is murdering the Nordic market because they came in and offered the product "women didn't want" to a wider base then 16-30. And now both men and women of all ages are crowding the store will the ones that "know what the modern woman want" are having sale after sale. They really didn't think women wanted a cheap blue wool sweater rather then a flimsy transparent blouse.	labels:It’s still supply and demand, they’re just creating artificial demand for their product.

text:I also wonder if men tend to buy clothing staples, and clothes for women tend to be on trend. So, we get cheaply made fast fashion that has extra development costs.	labels:100% because it's pretty easy to sell women stuff if you make them feel bad about themselves. I've recently been actively avoiding fast-fashion and buying more high-quality stapes, I end up buying a lot of "unisex" clothes.	episode_done:True
text:why are men's clothing generally not as expensive and better quality?	labels:The fabric content and construction methods  selected for menswear tend to be more durable (wool, Tweed, twill, cotton/cotton blend, denim, tencil, natural and synthetic suiting). It is also considered feminine to buy a broader range of colors and lighter weight fabrics so most retailers don't get trendier colors and fabric weights when stocking menswear because they don't think it will sell. It's more to do with risk aversion and gender assumptions than planned obsolescence.   I did menswear design in school and now that I'm learning to sew for myself, it's very challenging. Women's garments have more variety, but the weight of many of the fabrics with better drape are pretty flimsy.	episode_done:True
text:why are men's clothing generally not as expensive and better quality?	labels:A lot of my basic items are mens ones, plain tshirts and polo shirts, pyjamas, I tend to buy mens hoodies (or even kids ones because I'm short) and mens sweatshirts too, if I can find them small enough.  I find the primark slim fit muscle tee's for men to be actually pretty good, as in not noticeably masculine when I wear them, but then again I'm not the girliest of girls either so I don't mind wearing mens clothes, or mens watches for that matter	episode_done:True
text:why are men's clothing generally not as expensive and better quality?	labels:men’s fashion is like a glacier- moving in one direction, not fluid, extremely slow moving- and women’s like an ocean, fast moving fads, extremely fluid, moving in all directions. Also men don’t go shopping as often, so if their clothes give out before they are due for another shopping trip, men will perceive the product’s quality to be bad. I feel like brands know these things and so they make what appeals to their consumers. They don’t need to sell women quality because most of their customers want to buy something new before the old wears out. Men don’t buy that way, I would imagine.	episode_done:True

Color scheme. What else feeds temptations? Trends and scared of not seeing it again. I would say if you love a piece immediately then buy it but don't take tag off. Try it out in real life first.  Also tastes change. Like I went from utility pants to wearing and liking tight jeans then back to wanting more room except I don't have any. So having an open minded/ wardrobe with pieces to take you out of comfort zone, not too far, wouldn't hurt.	episode_done:True
text:My incomplete guide for buying less in 2021	labels:I wanted to completely upgrade my wardrobe and I spend a lot of money on clothes this month. Even though there are still a few things left I want to buy, I want to spend less money and be more mindfully since I came to the realisation that there are always new clothes, styles and trends and you can't have them all. I am selling my old stuff I don't wear anymore to start fresh. I will also delete most of my shopping Apps and unsubsribe to newsletters because it is too tempting and make a list of things I **actually** want and need.	episode_done:True
text:My incomplete guide for buying less in 2021	labels:I cleaned out and organized my entire closet earlier this year. I sold what no longer fit and things I haven't worn in a while. I use the money I make from selling my old clothes to purchase new items. I put my entire capsule wardrobe onto a Powerpoint, so I can see what items I need or would like to add. Then, I shop around for the pieces I want and save them to my Shoptagr extension in Chrome. The extension keeps all my wishlist items in one place, and alerts me then they are discounted. This keeps me from impulse-buying just because something is on sale, since I know these are things I have been wanting for a while.  I also unsubscribed from all newsletters, but I follow the brands I like on a website called Milled, which is a search engine for email newsletters. It lets me follow all the brands I typically shop at, but because the newsletters don't go directly to my inbox, I'm not as tempted to purchase. It's also helpful to look back through the brand's emails, just to get a sense of their sale patterns.	episode_done:True

I also like to people watch and if I see someone in a really cool outfit and I have similar pieces in my closet, I’ll try to replicate their look. I live in a « fashion capital » so there’s a wide variety of styles and tons of inspiration!	episode_done:True

text:Where do you find inspiration for your Outfits?	labels:I use Pinterest/Instagram for inspiration, and then plot out on paper with actual items I own. I create at least 20 outfits a week so I never run out of things to wear.	episode_done:True
text:Where do you find inspiration for your Outfits?	labels:I like to search for specific items for outfit inspiration. For example, I wanted to get more mileage out of my white jeans so I would search  -white jeans -white denim -white jeans outfit  on Instagram, Pinterest, and occasionally Google (specifically looking for blog photos rather than modeled pics for stores).  I save all the ones I really like, and if I’m instagram I will follow someone if their overall style is to my liking. Then I’ll go back through the ones I had liked and assess which outfits I can make immediately, and which ones require any extras that may or may not be added to my wish list. Looking for outfits based on specific items in my wardrobes has been so much more helpful than aimlessly searching for inspo.	episode_done:True
text:Advice needed - Nordstroms Out of Stock items	labels:Since the post is being left up for general discussion I also want to throw out that if something sells out because it’s on a good sale you can bookmark the page and keep checking it to see when/if someone returns it. I’ve gotten a few items this way by just being patient and checking in. The last one was something my mom really wanted so I checked for months and one finally got returned at the rack. It definitely beats paying the marked up prices on poshmark and the like.	episode_done:True
text:Advice needed - Nordstroms Out of Stock items	labels:Have you called a store near you? With Nordstrom specifically, your best bet is to get ahold of a sales rep and pray that they'll want to help you. They can do a stock search and see if there are any units left in the company (aka did someone return it?) that can be shipped from the store to you. You'd probably have to call periodically to check.  If it's something super hype, like the latest Supreme shirt, you're SOL and would have better luck buying it after-market at a higher price than retail.  Calling and having someone ship something to you from a store doesn't work for every company - Sephora won't do it and I don't think most fast fashion places will either. Your chances of getting a sold out item go up if you have an established relationship with a sales associate.
text:I have some experience with this. when I worked at Macy's, our stock search was more accurate than the website. if you don't have a relationship with a specific associate, calling at an off-time (meaning not Friday night or Saturday, weekdays are a safe bet) is the way to go.   Banana Republic's website was more accurate than the stock search ~4 years ago, don't know if that's changed. they're willing to ship from a store, their infrastructure just isn't as good as a department store's. don't bother with Forever 21-type stores, but mall stores are worth a shot. I remember J. Crew being ok about this.  smaller stores/sites are generally good about this. Tuckernuck and Emerson Fry let you sign up to be notified when something goes back in stock (usually from a return). also, you can generally find out about restocks from smaller brands' social media.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Advice needed - Nordstroms Out of Stock items	labels:In the Nordstrom app, I can still add out of stock items to my wishlist. Go to your wishlist and turn on the button that notifies you when one of your wishlisted items is back in stock or goes on sale.   You can do this with your Saved For Later list too (Checkout > move from Bag to Saved for Later) but the item must be in stock originally for you to add it to bag and then save it for later. Then if you turn on the Saved for Later notifications you’ll also get notified if it is back in stock or goes on sale.
text:Thanks I just set this up with a different size that's in stock. will I get a push notification?	labels:Yes you will (if your general notifications for the nordstrom app are turned on).	episode_done:True

text:I used to agree with this but Nordstrom has changed their algorithms and their site/app has much higher stock accuracy than it used to. And I can promise if it’s a final item in the company, the stock team is 99x more likely to locate it than a sales associate. The stock team needs to find a manager to sign off on a rejected order while a sales person answering the phone just needs to act like they checked (spoiler: they usually don’t).   Just check the app often, maybe multiple times a day, and place the order the second you see it.   Edit for clarity	labels:Used to work there and this isn’t true. Employees in store can check where items are and request other stores to ship it. They’ll typically try hard to do this too because they get commission off of it. There is the chance that the item can be denied if it’s only 1 in stock at another store, but they have a quota on denying items too, so they don’t want to do that often.   Try going into a store to see if they can find another store to ship it directly to you.
text:Me too. I worked for Nordstrom for almost ten years, mostly as a DM but also in HR, and quit last winter when my role moved into more of a fulfillment focus. Managers have to do “blitzes” to clear DTC screens and if web-team cannot find an item, they will come find a DM or ADM to do a last check and sign off on the reject.   Therefor, when you have a web order for a last in company, a manager will have a hand in trying to find the item where as a salesperson calling another store is likely to reach another salesperson, who may or may not have any interest in searching for the item. As you know, only the salesperson placing the order gets commission — not the salesperson on the other end looking for the item. Plus, if it’s a recent return, it might be in inventory but not back to its home department; in that case web will have much better chances of finding it.  Now that last in company items will show up on the app/website (they used to only show up in store on merch search) I see no reason to call the store to bother people with locating your items. The salespeople honestly hate finding DTCs, and they’ve started to restrict the sort of credit information salespeople can take over the phone. In Los Angeles, you can’t pay over the phone for designer items any more unless your card is already on file with a store associate.  This is all new as of about 2 years ago, and piloted in the Los Angeles stores so depending on where you worked and how long ago, this may sound new, but I can promise you this is how it’s being done currently.  Edit: also going to clarify the “quota” on denying items. The store’s fulfillment rate (which they usually refer to in terms of inventory accuracy) has to be above something like 88% to allow in-store pickup and same day services; but when you are calling a salesperson for a Manual DTC before placing, the order is not yet on their screen and doesn’t count for or against their inventory accuracy.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Other than the conventional black/blue/white pants or trousers, what other colour pants or trousers do you own ? How do you style it ?	labels:A few years ago, I had recently gotten a promotion and wanted to dress a bit fancier. I went a bit ham on Old Navy's pixie pants. I bought some really fun colours, mustard yellow, light pink, floral patterns, pastel blue, etc.   I used to style them primarily with black, dark, grey, white, chambray tops/blouses.  I grew bored of this phase and went back to blue jeans, but it was a fun experiment for the summer time! Especially when I didn't want to wear a dress, but still wanted to look fun but work appropriate.	episode_done:True
text:Other than the conventional black/blue/white pants or trousers, what other colour pants or trousers do you own ? How do you style it ?	labels:I used to have teal pants I wore all the time. I have been looking for pink, berry, or mustard yellow pants all year and I haven't found a pair yet. The only colored pant I have now, is a hot pink satin jogger. But haven't had a lot of chances to wear them as special occasion pants , I got them end of last year and wore them twice out and once at home.   In the teal pant era (this was a long time ago) I wore them with my myriad of black and white tops - this is one of my faves. And also color blocking! If I can recall, I wore them with chartreuse, yellow, and pastel blues and greens. And light grey.   I love color blocking and often have had colorful bottoms, I just mixed them with whatever colors I felt were complementary. I had a couple of cobalt blue skirts, and I think some pants as well. This color goes well with just about any bright. I wore these with pinks, greens, and yellows.   In my brain, mustard yellow is a neutral, so it goes with basically everything. Hot pink pants - this for me, in my wardrobe, works with other shades of pink, maybe burgundy, grey, and yellow. I do to have many other colors outside of these, so that is what I wear. I also like pink with greens.   I say pull out your color wheel and see which pairing you like. You do not need to be limited to neutrals.	episode_done:True
text:Other than the conventional black/blue/white pants or trousers, what other colour pants or trousers do you own ? How do you style it ?	labels:I’m the first to admit I have a pretty boring colour palette in my closet (I love it!) But I did try for a while as an exercise to make colourful capsule wardrobes where I could assemble 20 (digital) items and make 20 outfits. I had a lot of fun and really tried to go for colour. One thing I found was that you could have the wildest colours you want, so long as everything went together as a whole.   My suggestion for eg. Red pants would be the items in following categories: 1. Coordinating neutrals (like your white top) 2. Coordinating solids (eg a blush pink top, or a  mustardy colour if it’s more burgundy) 3. Coordinating prints (eg anything that has a bit of red in it to tie it all together) 4. Monochrome! Red on red!   Which category you choose in what quantity will depend on how bold your style is, but I think that with a little planning you could incorporate a colourful pant happily into your wardrobe!   Oh, edit to say: I have a teal pant that I really love. I wear it the following ways: 1. Coordinating neutrals: my wardrobe is black/white/silver so basically any black or white tops 2. Coordinating colours: again, don’t really have any but I do find it goes well with my silver camisole and shoes! 3. Coordinating prints: I used to have a white shirt with teal leaves all over it, match made in heaven! 4. Monochrome: with the matching teal blazer, or with a coordinating teal turtleneck under a different jacket!
text:Definitely on board with prints - I have printed pants and lots of printed tops. I usually match a print of one with a plain color of another that pulls from one of the print colors. Of course, I have way too many shoes (boots, really) to match... getting dressed this way is really fun but takes a long time since I tend to have too many options compared to too few, lol	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Other than the conventional black/blue/white pants or trousers, what other colour pants or trousers do you own ? How do you style it ?	labels:I have a pair of olive green pants and I used to have a pair of maroon ones that I loved and wore out. I also love plaid pants but only have one pair right now - white and black with a pale pink stripe.  Neutrals are always good with crazy color pants, but so are complimentary colors. Some combos I think would work:  Pink/Teal  Orange/Royal Blue  Purple/Mustard  &#x200B;  I wear my green pants with rose/blush a lot, and I also really like black and white pants that have a pattern on them. It's like the fun of wild colored pants without the commitment to a color.	episode_done:True
text:Other than the conventional black/blue/white pants or trousers, what other colour pants or trousers do you own ?

Just love them. Wear with any of the print colors or white	episode_done:True
text:Other than the conventional black/blue/white pants or trousers, what other colour pants or trousers do you own ? How do you style it ?	labels:While my wardrobe is fast turning as black as my soul, I’ve enjoyed two pairs of colorful pants: a pair of mustard cords, and a pair of salmon boyfriend chinos, both from Gap. I’m glad colorful pants exist! I’m heartbroken the mustard cords didn’t hold their color for more than a few years—now they’re just an odd yellow shade, like Charlotte Perkins Gilman picked out the shade—but in their prime I loved wearing them with Weejuns or midcalf boots, a chambray or blue plaid shirt or a lace cap-sleeve and denim jacket, a chunky necklace. Granted, this was the early/mid 2010s. I styled the salmon chinos about the same. Now, if I were to choose a pair, I’d go for a jewel-toned pair, perhaps Eileen Fisher lantern pants in that gorgeous red color, and pair with black. I’d pair a high-contrast pant with a high-contrast/clear top, and muted pants with a muted top.	episode_done:True
text:Other than the conventional black/blue/white pants or trousers, what other colour pants or trousers do you own ? How do you style it ?	labels:Earth tones are a BIG winner if you're trying to reach outside of the standard dark tones like Black/Blues. The next ring up from White is most definitely a CREAM/OFF-WHITE shade. Grab an assortment of camel/chestnut browns too. & then find some mute shades of Green (not emerald or teal), but more like green shade that are within range of a Matcha green color....and voila! The start of an awesome color range.	episode_done:True
text:Other than the conventional black/blue/white pants or trousers, what other colour pants or trousers do you own ? How do you style it ?	labels:I have beige/tan trousers. I style them with brown, or white, or black and white print, or grey. They can go with many neutrals.   I also have rust/brick color trousers that I normally style with other earth tones or white. I style them for both casual and business casual outfits.   Then I have two joggers from GAP that are yellow and also pink (as in Barbie pink)  and those go well with white or black and white stripe. These two colors are for casual outfits only.	episode_done:True

text:Other than the conventional black/blue/white pants or trousers, what other colour pants or trousers do you own ? How do you style it ?	labels:I have a royal blue jumpsuit and magenta trousers. Sadly the Magenta ones don’t fit anymore. Also sad they are polyester because... they’re not warm for our winters but too hot for our summers so I rarely wore them.   I found even though the pants are bright I end up styling very neutral colours with the magenta pair - white, cream, camel so it balances out	episode_done:True

text:Stealing her style: Nicole Kidman as "Grace Fraser" in "The Undoing"	labels:Thanks for writing this - really nice to see both the why and the how of someone's style - the way you have styled is so awesome.  For me the two amazing stand out pieces are the purple skirt and the way you've styled those colours overall together. Even though the skirt is the statement and the colour should be overwhelming, it all comes together beautifully.  Also coloured tights :-)  Then the red skirt is similar - a stand out colour that is offset by the browns (love the boots - that's what drew my eye initially - I obviously have a boot problem :)  ) - and then you accent it with that goreous, contrasting green scarf.  I love Nicole Kidman's red/burgundy leather skirt and in the next picture in the series I find myself wanting the luxe skirt.
text:Thank you so much for the detailed feedback! Those vintage suede skirts are serving me so well.

And with the exception of walking a red carpet or a black tie (or higher) level of formality, I have something in my closet that could work for the occasion (wedding, political fundraiser, etc).

text:How do I feel more comfortable "dressing up"?	labels:Make it the new normal. Dress up all the time and then you will set a new normal of always looking fabulous. Of course then you might have the opposite problem of “are you ok?” when you’re not dressed up lol	episode_done:True
text:How do I feel more comfortable "dressing up"?	labels:The best advice I've ever heard about fashion was that (and I'm badly paraphrasing here) if you wear something more than once, it just becomes something you wear. If you wear a hat a couple times, you can be a "hat person". If you dress up often, you're a just person who dresses up.   It's cliché, but I feel like all about confidence. I have friends who like to dress up for all occasions, but nobody ever bats an eye because they just act as if their fully choreographed fit is a tshirt and jeans. People are almost never thinking about you as much as you think they are (you can google the "spotlight effect"). Also, I feel like wearing fun outfits around the house can help you get used to feeling "dressed up" in a casual environment, and is a good place to safely test-drive fun outfits.   I think there's a weird societal stigma against trying hard, which I think is so lame. It's cool to try hard if you want to try hard! I don't get why people feel the need to comment on how you're dressed. Honestly, I think that saying that it makes you happy is enough of a justification for being """"overdressed"""" (by their standards).   The last thing is think about all of those people you see dressed up on the street, where you think they look great, but you're too shy to say anything. When you're dressed up in a way that makes you feel good, the right people will notice, even if they don't say anything. The world is full of silent admirers!!	episode_done:True
text:How do I feel more comfortable "dressing up"?	labels:1) Be early when you're dressed up. People will assume you're late because you were getting dressed even if that's not true.  2) It might actually help to wear the clothes around the house. Even just for an hour or two on your day off then hang them up again in the closet 3) Do you love to look at dresses or wear them? I really like to look at high heels, but I just don't buy them because they make me uncomfortable. If the dresses are making you uncomfortable, then maybe they're not really "you." Maybe you just enjoy collecting them?
text:This right here. Wearing it around the house until you forget you have it on is how I got over the fear of wearing dark lipsticks. Besides you get the feel of if you're actually comfortable or not.  Most importantly you understand if you're wearing it for yourself or others.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do I feel more comfortable "dressing up"?	labels:I get it, I'm a nurse who is also an introvert who loves fashion/style. Its tough because we can't express ourselves at work, and I've also felt insecure about wearing my best clothes on the rare occasion I would go out (especially nowadays), and feeling like no occasion is good enough to wear my nicer or different clothes.   I still struggle with it, but my advice is to incorporate items slowly and consider how things can be dressed up or down. For example, I have some shorter skirts that might be a bit of a statement on their own, but I'll bust them out in winter with a sweater, scarf, and leggings and go grocery shopping. Simple and still casual. I do the same with shorter dresses. A nicer top and jeans is not over the top by any means. Try pairing a nicer pair of shoes with your jeans to dress down the shoes (and dress up the jeans i guess!)  As for asking why you're so dressed up, I don't see why people have to comment in that way, but I'm guessing they mean no harm. I typically get compliments from friends on my stuff but they also enjoy style, so if you hang out with people who aren't into it at all then they probably won't get it, or maybe they are interested and are in the same dilemma as you. Either way, the appropriate thing to do would be to compliment your skirt or top or whatever, not make you feel weird about it. I think "because I like it" is actually the best response. How can anyone argue with that? If you want to be petty you might say "oh, don't you like it?" and see how they respond, I'd actually be curious. The more you wear your nicer things the less you will be asked. Fake it till you make it! I've worn things out that I thought maybe was "too much", and people might stare but for all you know they are admiring your look, and occasionally I will get a compliment from strangers which is a great confidence boost.
text:This is such great advice. Not only does it help one get more comfortable with dressing up, it's just good fashion sense.  The 'why are you dressed up comments' I think are a function of location. Where I am and the places I go I get way more compliments on my outfit than questions why I'm dressed up. I think it would be a bit more difficult if you live in an area where everyone is super casual. But hey, maybe you'll inspire others!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do I feel more comfortable "dressing up"?	labels:> should I try to incorporate things one at a time or just muddle though the vaguely uncomfortable period of time until I feel comfortable?  Yes. Fake it till you make it. Wear one nice, "dressy" thing at a time until you feel comfortable enough to dress up in an entire outfit. Wear it around the house until you feel comfortable enough to wear it outside. I used to be a tomboy who lived in baggy t-shirts and jeans, and I remembered being so self-conscious the first time I wore a skirt and flats, but I just kept wearing them, and soon the feeling wore off - I got used to being dressed up, and people got used to seeing me dressed up, so nobody commented on it anymore.  &#x200B;  > what to say when people make the, "why are you all dressed up" comment  because, "I just felt like it" never seems to be good enough.   Why? That's a perfectly legit reason to me. You deserve to feel good about yourself.	episode_done:True
text:How do I feel more comfortable "dressing up"?	labels:Actually, this is a great time to address this. Once you come out of the pandemic, people will have somewhat forgotten what your normal is so you can set a new tone. Dress it up the first few times you see people and it will set the tone for a new normal. No one will even think it's weird because I bet everyone is sitting at home just wishing they would wear anything other than sweats. So, for the first couple of times at least, make sure you dress up. After that it'll be your normal. I kinda dealt with this too. I live in the bay area, the most people wear here are jeans and a tee. I hate it so will go with dresses and other things often and feel really overdressed. I realized that for me the best way to not feel weird about that was to dress down my shoes. So wearing ankle boots was the fanciest I would go with shoes and that was only on rare occasions. Most of the time I would pair sandals or sneakers with my outfits and look like I fit in again.	episode_done:True
text:How do I feel more comfortable "dressing up"?	labels:Try to see things from their perspective. *You* know that this is your real sense of style, and you have liked these clothes for a long time, but to your friends and family, you are a person that wears a t-shirt and jeans. So when you wear a skirt, that's very different and out of character for you. You just need to grind through the first few times, and then they will expect you to dress like that and they won't say anything.  And yes, "because I felt like it" is a good enough answer. Did someone tell you it wasn't? They're wrong.

text:How do I feel more comfortable "dressing up"?	labels:I realised that I do this all the time.

text:How do I feel more comfortable "dressing up"?	labels:Own it! We have so few occasions these days to wear something nice, I’ve been overdressing to go to the post office! If someone asks, just tell them you’re wearing it because it’s what you wanted to wear! Or bc YOU like it? If someone says you’re overdressed maybe be like “no, you’re UNDERdressed, not you must be embarrassed.” Personal style is yours, for you! If you like it, own it, I’m sure you look great!	episode_done:True
text:How do I feel more comfortable "dressing up"?	labels:If you feel uncomfortable wearing a fancy blouse and skirt, try wearing a skirt with a sweater! I absolutely love that look. And to address the people asking "why are you dressing up?" Don't worry about it! Just answer honestly: "I really like this blouse! Or: "I love to look nice!" Many people really appreciate nice dressing. I'm still in school, and though I can appreciate a cute sweatpants fit I'd be ecstatic to see a nice skirt and cardi combo. Make it normal, and people will appreciate it!	episode_done:True
text:How often do you wash your clothes?	labels:I find that washing and drying my clothes gets them back in shape. Like if my jeans are feeling less snug because I've worn them 3 or 4 times, I wash them to get them back to the right fit that feels comfortable for me. It's the same with jumpers and tops. They get baggier with each wear and start to look sloppy on me.

text:How often do you wash your clothes?	labels:I conceptually understand that I probably don't need to wash my clothes as often as I do as someone who lives in a temperate-cold climate, and studies from home, but I can't get over my childhood conditioning to wash clothes after almost every wear. My parents grew up in South East Asia, where you practically have to shower and change clothes twice a day, and that training runs deep. I probably wash T-shirts after 1 wear, gym clothes after 1 wear, bras every 1-2 wears, jeans/pants every 2-4 wears, and outerwear/sweaters less frequently (when I spill something, or every 3-4 weeks for my indoor home sweaters that get frequent wear). I am however very careful with how I wash clothes- always on cold, use appropriate detergents (euclean for wool/cashmere, soak for silk/other delicates, and unscented tide for everything else), and I try to air dry everything that I can. Clothing care is a big part of how I approach sustainability; my purchasing habits might not always be the most sustainable, but I try to take care of the items that I own well so that they last for me (and maybe even for a second owner). I also would prefer to wash clothes a touch too often than not often enough and end up smelling; I spent a year studying in Germany, and my host family was great, but I kind of felt like they didn't wash clothes as often as I would to prevent smells; natural fibers are not = deodorant, they still need to be washed. Now if I could only kick my dry shampoo habit....washing my hair is so much more work than laundry.	episode_done:True

text:How often do you wash your clothes?	labels:Similar. Except I wash my jeans after 6-10 wears. I never had any issues with my denim getting damaged in a wash.	episode_done:True
text:How often do you wash your clothes?	labels:You all do a lot of laundry!  I only wash base layers (panties, socks, camis, undershirts, leggings, hosiery) regularly. Everything else I hang up on a garment rack to air out. I hit it with cheap vodka in a spray bottle to deodorize/sanitize. I learned that trick in costume class in college, much more skin safe than febreze. I use a steamer to get out the wrinkles and reshape. I recycle my old toothbrush brushes/cut up tshirt rags to spot clean with felsnaptha or oxi clean.  If you have good hygiene and aren’t sweating, there’s really no need to wash most things, especially with a washing machine. Clothing experiences a lot of friction while being agitated in the machine and that will wear your fibers out. I have shirts I bought at 16 that still look brand new and spot care preserves all my vintage/handmade pieces. The hang/vodka/steam combo is great for bras too, which should only be hand washed if they need to be thoroughly cleaned.	episode_done:True
text:How often do you wash your clothes?	labels:Same, I only spot wash when something has stains and machine wash if something smells, otherwise I'll keep wearing it even if it's been a long time since the last wash. One thing I do often though, is air clothes out, even if they don't smell, specially if it's clothes that touch my skin directly, like tshirts and tight fitting knits etc, these items might seem clean and free of smells but if left in the wardrobe for a long time, will start to smell, airing them extends the freshness.  The only exception is pants and socks, they are washed after every use.	episode_done:True
text:How often do you wash your clothes?	labels:Pretty much the same - I’ll wash t-shirts after every wear, for blouses if I’m only wearing them for a couple hours I’ll just hang them up again, if it’s all day I’ll wash after a wear. I wash my jeans every 5-8 wears same as other pants because all of mine bag out regardless. Sweaters I usually handwash every 1-2 years lol. Leather stuff I try to condition at least once a year (my favourite shoes get more love).   It helps a lot that I’m not very sweaty or smelly (confirmed by outside sources).	episode_done:True
text:How often do you wash your clothes?	labels:I sniff test everything (except underwear, which is one wear/wash) and I just purchased a wool sweater for the first time and I was *so suspicious* of the care instructions telling me not to wash it lol. I scoured the whole internet looking for something to tell me that this information was fake and that my suspicions were correct. After an overwhelming amount of evidence telling me I would have wasted $100 if I don't listen to people smarter than me, I begrudgingly made a deal with myself to give airing out only a try and I would wash it if it so much as had a hint of a stink.  Four months later and the sweater is going strong! That'll show me. In hindsight it makes sense that wool is water and scent wicking, because sheep have it "on" all the time, it was just a big adjustment for me since I had never really had natural fiber clothes before.	episode_done:True
text:How often do you wash your clothes?	labels:Underwear/socks/masks: 1 wear  Tee shirts/tanks/cotton tops/flannels: 1-3 wears, depending on sweat level  Blouses (silks, fragile rayons, etc): As infrequently as possible--basically if I spill or they smell  Sweaters: Similar to blouses, but I tend to do all of these in one big go (delicate cycle in garment bags with a gentle wool/cashmere detergent then lay flat to dry), so some get tossed in earlier   Dresses: pretty much never unless I spill   Jeans: once a month ish, or when I spill on them. Washing helps get them back to shape if they start to bag out too much, and eventually they will start to smell  Workout clothes: 1 wear  PJs: 3 ish wears   Jackets: rarely--fleeces, sweatshirts, really anything soft will be more often, but if it's anything heavier than that I just spot treat stains	episode_done:True

text:This rings so true for my sister in law. They were saving up money to down a house.

She has a bunch of jewelry. :/	labels:i’m so sorry that happened to her, yikes.
text:Actually...she and her mom are selfish and greedy. I guess I should have explained. My brother and sister in law were saving up money to buy a house. My brother saved up around $80,000. Then, my sister in law and her mom took all of that money and bought jewelry. Their reasoning was because "in case something happens to my brother"... like he was going to die or something...  He was mad. But he couldn't say anything and just start over saving money again.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone invest in real jewelry?	labels:I have an extensive jewelry wardrobe, I love it. It’s all fine - real gold, real diamonds, real gems, platinum, silver etc. I switch up jewelry daily (pre-covid when I actually went to the office and out of the house) including my wedding jewerly. I have my original diamond & platinum set, plus an eternity band in yellow gold that I wear when I’m wearing yellow gold jewelry and an emerald cut eternity band that I wear when I wear my emerald cut three stone right hand ring.   My birthstone is emerald so I have several pieces with this stone. My son’s birthstone is sapphire so I have both a blue sapphire ring and a yellow sapphire ring.   Casual jewelry is yellow gold usually - hoops in various sizes, bangles, gold chains & pendants, my Tiffany bold T ring in 18k is one of my fave pieces to wear for a minimalist look. I also like the Mejuri slim dome ring for this as well.  I do have pearls - a vintage strand that was my grandmother’s and I have matching pearl studs plus black pearl studs.   For earrings I mostly always wear hoops. I have yellow and white gold hoops in all sizes small to large and diamond hoops in mid size and large. I have one pair of 1.25 carat total studs that I never ever wear.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone invest in real jewelry?	labels:My jewelry style is very simple so I tend to wear the same thing daily. I invested in solid gold necklaces and studs for this purpose. If I want to mix things up a bit with my earrings, I have purchased filled gold or at least gold plated. My plan is to see if I like the style and if I wear them enough before I invest in the solid gold versions of them. These days it seems like I purchase jewelry exclusively from Etsy!	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone invest in real jewelry?	labels:Im 24 now, my entire life my grandmother has gifted me high quality pieces for important occasions in my life. A small silver, engraved, velvet lined jewelry holder when i was born, small 14kt studs when i got my ears pierced, small diamond earring for my 13th birthday, etc  As I got older and had my own money I decided to do it too. I hate fast fashion jewelry because it ruins so quickly and dont buy it, so i enjoy hunting for the perfect piece for each special occasion. Over time other family members have also gifted me nice pieces (new and heirloom) because my family knows how much I enjoy them.  Some of my own favorite pieces are vintage that i've bought at antique stores. I also buy gold filled or gold vermeil on etsy.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone invest in real jewelry?	labels:Yes. After paying for cheaper jewelry most of my life and seeing it get ruined easily, I spurgled for my first Catbird piece. Now I have 3 necklaces, 2 pairs of earrings and 2 bracelets from them (and one from an artist they stock) that are so good. I can wear them all day and night, shower in them and still they look great. I only buy the gold pieces but it's been well worth the splurge and I intend on keeping them forever.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone invest in real jewelry?	labels:I’m basically mostly interested in paying enough that a piece of jewelry I love doesn’t have the metallic coating peel off after a year. I’ve had so many pieces I loved the design of get ruined because they were cheap. So I look for sterling silver, solid gold or at least gold-filled but also stuff like brass that’s cheaper, and looks it, but at least doesn’t peel. I don’t like gold-plated or vermeil because it has a much thinner layer than gold fill.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone invest in real jewelry?	labels:The only “fine” jewelry I own are my engagement and wedding rings. Everything else I own is basically costume jewelry-I’m a sucker for fun resin earrings. Part of it is my personal taste, the other is definitely affordability.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone invest in real jewelry?	labels:I didn’t really start buying fine jewelry until my mid thirties and even then I don’t buy too much of it because it can get pretty expensive and while I love jewelry, I don’t have justification for buying it most of the time. 😬😅 I think the only real fine jewelry I bought for myself was some diamond stud earrings and engraved gold rings. Most of the fine jewelry I own is actually passed down or gifted to me. All my eclectic pieces I own are more along the lines of fashion/costume jewelry and purchases by myself for casual wear.  As for vendors I like, here are a few names I follow: Ochre Objects, Vrai, Caysie van Bebber (really expensive and I don’t own anything from her; I just like looking at her work, haha), Liesel Love, Aurora Designs, and Social Value (this one is great for affordable diamond jewelry).  For nice, eclectic pieces, I like Local Eclectic.  For old estate pieces, I follow ChelseagirlNYC, Zacharysjewelry, and Ivy & Rose.  Lastly I do like to look at Blue Nile. Sometimes they have good deals!
text:Seconding Vrai and Oro. I got two gold necklaces from them a few years ago and am very happy with the quality and design. They do high quality dainty jewelry perfectly.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone invest in real jewelry?	labels:Going for good materials is definitely the way forward if it's something I'd want to wear for years to come. I prefer solid gold or silver to plated pieces which will barely last a few months before coming off. However, if it's a fun fashion style I'm not adverse to cheaper options like gold filled or vermeil.  Same goes for stones - e.g. diamonds or pearls over CZ or plastic pearls.  There is a wide spectrum of 'real stuff' depending on your budget and brand preference. E.g. a Tiffany diamond is more expensive than a non branded one from Costco. A lesser quality diamond (based on the 4 C's) or lab diamond is cheaper. 14k gold is cheaper than 18k gold and sterling silver is cheaper than 14k gold...  Not sure if I'm still considered young anymore but I've certainly always enjoyed jewelry! Sterling silver is cheap to buy typically if you don't go for branded (Tiffany, David Yurman) - Etsy is a favourite. Plus second hand saves a lot. Gold is a lot cheaper in Asia if you buy non branded as the labour markup is a lot lower. Given the weight method of sales, solid gold earrings and rings are quite affordable as a result.   And cultured freshwater pearls are a lot cheaper than say Akoya pearls of AAA quality. When I was on holiday in Asia, it'd be common to pay £5 or something and pick some oysters that they'd open up and you get to keep all the little seed pearls they had inside  Typically there were quite a few! Goes to show how easy it is to farm them.  Overall, I think if you're savvy about how to shop and willing to compromise on quality, these items are all affordable.  I'd say have a browse for what you enjoy wearing and like the look of and go from there. Some people might enjoy a single classic item and save up and others have a wide range. I'd say pawnbrokers, eBay and Etsy are some of my favourite go-to places depending on what I'm looking for.
text:This is the highest comment right now, so I just want to point out to other casual jewelry owners that fine jewelry holds value. It's highly unlikely that freshwater pearls you buy at retail are going to resell at a similar price, vs AAA Akoya pearls.  >Goes to show how easy it is to farm them  Farmed pearls aren't as valuable as natural pearls - similar to natural vs synthetic (aka lab) diamonds. The rarity of a natural pearl drives/retains its value.  >if you're savvy about how to shop and willing to compromise on quality, these items are all affordable.  This... really confuses me in a thread about investment grade jewelry. Store of value investments typically don't suddenly become more affordable; they aren't considered sound investments if this is the case. (There are exceptions, like copper, whose value is tied to demand for construction, but that's different than gems.) This statement is like trying to claim you can buy a blue chip stock on sale. Happens with recessions or a major event, but the majority of the time it can be counted on as a stable store of value.	labels:Fine jewelry really does not hold its value, I certainly wouldn't say (as a jeweler) that "the majority of the time it can be counted on as a stable store of value". Buying jewelry as an investment is like buying a car as an investment. You aren't going to get anywhere close to a full return on it unless it's a particularly rare or sought-after piece, which is the vast majority of cases. You might get what the materials are worth but that's going to be notably less than the retail value you paid. This is especially true for diamonds, which are relatively abundant and artificially marked up. Other gemstones like emerald, ruby, and sapphire hold their value better but even then, unless you have a truly remarkable one I wouldn't hold your breath about seeing a return on it.	episode_done:True

text:Discussion: LGBTQIA+ Signaling, Presentation, and Commodification in Fashion	labels:I’m queer and get read as straight a lot, so clothing is a tool, albeit one I don’t always feel comfortable using.  The other thing for me is that I sometimes feel like my body is incompatible with queer fashion? I’m pretty fortunate to have a relatively “desirable” body, but I’m short and top-heavy, so I feel like the androgynous queer outfits I like are meant for people much more willowy than I am, the femme-er stuff is more feminine than I feel comfortable with, and the more masc stuff is too masc for me. So I default to just whatever I have that I like, which tends to read as straight, if not quite conventionally feminine and sort of sweater-heavy. And when I’ve leaned into what feels like queer fashion to me, other people tend not to read it that way.  Anyways this was kind of long but to actually answer your questions:  1) Yes I do, though at this point mostly in the form of jewelry and more recently hair 2) Sometimes it means signaling and sometimes it means wearing clothes that (joyously?)  reflect your authentic self even in defiance of cultural norms. I would probably be better off if I figured out which definition I want to define myself with  3) IMO sometimes the stereotypes are a way to signal because the media denies us representation and sometimes they exist because of the representation the media gives us. For people my age (20s) I think it’s more the latter  4) I always feel pressure to present gayer. I think impostor syndrome is common in minority groups and when the thing that makes you different isn’t immediately visible, it’s natural to want to either bury it or lean in and use it as a shield or a signal. I haven’t figured out what that means for me in practice, but the urge is there.	episode_done:True
text:Discussion: LGBTQIA+ Signaling, Presentation, and Commodification in Fashion	labels:I just wear what I want and what I like the look of. I do admire queer fashion but it’s hard to tell what is queer or what is genz fashion. To me anything slightly alternative is queer or butch/shirts. The media has a lot of influence over all stereotypes but I think they are trying to move away from them. I’m not sure of my sexuality but if I do find I am queer I don’t think I would present in a way just to look queer.	episode_done:True
text:Discussion: LGBTQIA+ Signaling, Presentation, and Commodification in Fashion	labels:At some point I wanted others to know I'm gay from meeting me, so I got a pixie cut and called it good. It was a bad haircut, it didn't feel like "me", and guys still hit on me. I've gone through other time periods where others couldn't tell my sexuality from my appearance. This was something I was proud of, due to internalized homophobia. (But other queer women always knew. It's the vibe.)  Now, I'm more comfortable with myself and comfortable playing around with masc/femme in how I dress and present. I've made a few subtle changes with my clothes. But what has really made a difference is allowing myself to use more masculine mannerisms - the way I stand, the way I talk, the way I carry myself. In the past I've felt awkward in social settings despite being an extrovert, and I've recently realized this is mainly due to the dissonance between the gender role I'm expected to perform, and what's going on internally. By accepting my androgynous/masculine side, I've started to feel free of awkwardness.  To me, queer fashion is not one thing. There are many different queer and lesbian fashion styles. Just like straight people, we have different subcultures and styles within queerness. You got your art queers, your sporty queers, your co-op queers, your preppy queers. But there's often an element of playing with and mixing masculine and feminine and androgynous, both in the clothes and the way you wear them and the way you act.	episode_done:True
text:Discussion: LGBTQIA+ Signaling, Presentation, and Commodification in Fashion	labels:These are the two questions that interest me most, so:   *What does queer fashion mean to you?*    Queer fashion is whatever a person who identifies as Queer identifies as their way of approaching clothes/self expression.  I'm reminded of a Hannah Gadsby quote, where she talks about someone complaining there wasn't enough "lesbian content" in her comedy, to which her reply was "I was on the stage the whole time."  I feel like defining something as "Queer" can be a little...exclusionary, especially when it's used to exclude others. "Oh, you don't dress "gay". Well, ok.  *Bonus question for LGBTQIA+ folks - do you feel pressure to present a certain way based on wanting to signal to others or what the media has stereotyped a certain group to present like?*    Yes, but usually by other LGBTQIA+ folks. The rise of social media has been great because a lot of people feel more comfortable expressing their identities...but it seems like there's this assumed homogenity which has got even stronger (I'm not even that old, but predate social media by a good few years).  I am all for expressing identity! I love that LGBTQIA+ people feel they can do that!    But " are you ever gay if..." shit makes me tired.  Media has stereotyped us enough. Let's not do it to myself. Caveat: I could just be salty that I look bad in cuffed jeans :P	episode_done:True
text:Discussion: LGBTQIA+ Signaling, Presentation, and Commodification in Fashion	labels:This is actually such an interesting topic. As a bisexual teenager i often fit the “fashion stereotypes” of a bisexual because I look extremely different everyday. I dress in a number of styles, some being more masculine and some more feminine. I use pinterest for all my outfit inspiration, i never really think about whether or not it’s “queer fashion”, I just kind of like what i like.  I will say i consistently feel pressured to dress a certain way. Because I dress in a number of styles I’ve realized the way you dress will tend to attract different kinds of people. For feminine women who like girls it’s hard to get attention from other women because most are going to assume that you’re straight.  Edit: Just letting everyone know because I think it’s funny. Ive recently noticed that i also walk differently depending on the way I dress. When i dress more masculine my walk is more relaxed, i have my hands in my pockets, and i slouch v.s. when i dress feminine i sway a bit when i walk and have good posture.	episode_done:True
text:Discussion: LGBTQIA+ Signaling, Presentation, and Commodification in Fashion	labels:I’m queer and i have definitely felt like i had to dress more “queer”, even though i am still closeted. No one was pressuring me, but it was more like me just wanting to fit into that archetype, of the cool queer who dresses vaguely androgynously with the beanies, baseball caps and dad shirts (but i really do love a good buttonup). But ultimately, that isn’t me. I prefer more feminine (typically feminine, if you will) outfits. But I do aspire to own a pair of docs, wear rainbow clothes etc. I want to give off a “queer vibe” if anyone gets what i’m saying. If you know you know.	episode_done:True
text:Discussion: LGBTQIA+ Signaling, Presentation, and Commodification in Fashion	labels:I'm a too femme to function lesbian and stereotypical queer fashion always leaves me feeling left out in the cold. I don't like how I look in flannel and doc martens. I really do like how I look in an embroidered satin maxi skirt.  Going back in time, I used to feel like I had only two options : butch or look straight. It was not a fun choice. Neither was right for me. I spent a lot of high school looking way more masculine than I really felt comfortable with. It was partway through college that I realized that I had a third choice. Perform the hell out of stereotypical feminity. Embrace the chiffon and satin but do it on my own terms.  I don't look exactly like your average straight woman these day. It's subtle but there's a difference. Well there's also the fact that I dress like I'm an escapee from a Victorian brothel. I play with feminity. I wear petticoats beneath skirts and dye my hair blue. It's not the same kind of feminitity as a the average straight lady. It's a conscious performance of femme and not an uncritical acceptance of gender norms. It works for me.	episode_done:True
text:Discussion: LGBTQIA+ Signaling, Presentation, and Commodification in Fashion	labels:Idk I believe clothes have no gender. You could wear button ups and be a butch all you want and I’d be proud of you for not following the stereotypes. I’m feminine and attracted to feminine women. I don’t feel pressure chasing the stereotypes bc it’s not who I am.	episode_done:True
text:Discussion: LGBTQIA+ Signaling, Presentation, and Commodification in Fashion	labels:I am a bi woman. And while I know it doesn’t hold true for most wlw, I am definitely the ‘femme’ one in the relationship. (Or I would be, if I wasn’t single.) So for me, I would feel the need to dress in a more feminine way. Not saying I would go all 50’s housewives in heels, but even if I wear jeans or dark colours, I would incorporate things like hair ribbons, makeup or even mannerisms to look more ‘feminine’ I guess.   I am aware that I am contributing to the idea that ‘someone in a wlw relationship must wear the pants and the other the skirt’, and I do feel a bit bad for that sometimes. But where I live, the most common wlw relationships (not that you see much of them because Asia), consist of a butch and a femme. I suppose this plays a hand in it.	episode_done:True

However, when morning comes, I just want to be comfortable and wearing the leather mini-skirt with the 4" heeled booties I imagined the night before sounds unbearable.

Just because you don’t have the word to distinguish a color, does not mean you cannot visually appreciate the difference or incorporate it into your outfits?  Most men I know have a very limited color vocabulary - pretty much the basic colors of the rainbow (and honestly you may get some blank stares if you say “indigo” and “violet” outside of the rainbow context instead of “blue” and “purple.”) But my husband can see colors and visually distinguish between my coral top and my blush blouse even though both he would describe as “pink.” He even owns shirts that incorporate salmon pink and lavender and turquoise although he has no idea what they are called. I also doubt that he knows his sports gear feature “chartreuse” and “teal.” His clothing color limitations are more gender-limited than word-limited.	episode_done:True

text:I came here to say this! Having words vs not having words for something doesn’t change whether or not you can see that colour lol. Language does change how you construct your worldview (eg whether you think of time as linear vs circular is often rooted in how you talk about time) but not so wholly as to affect colour.   I think more so than language, culture and location would have a huge impact on the colours you wear. I grew up in a hugely colourful country and all levels of formality allow colourful clothes, but now I live in Canada and everyone wears black and blue and grey year-round, especially in winter, even casually.

text:Does your language affect how you wear colors?	labels:I read an article in scientific American forever ago that discussed the way some languages are structured to center the group or the space rather than the individual speaker the way English does, which can contribute massively to how a culture's values are learned (individual gratification vs acting on behalf of the group, consuming/hoarding natural resources vs conserving/cultivating them). In my amateur  assessment, I'd say language effects our fashion choices more in the realm of what we're dressing to communicate (personal wealth, individual perspective and creativity, respect for the natural environment, etc), and in the realm of how we consume fashion (desiring to have more or better than others in our community, desiring newness, desiring to leave a smaller environmental footprint, etc).	episode_done:True

text:Naked and Famous Raw Denim Review/Fit/Experience	labels:It's a bit pricey but one option is having jeans altered to fit. Either by a competent tailor who is willing to **alter from the inseam** (and preserve the selvedge outseam) or a speciality shop like Railcar Fine Goods that you can mail your jeans to. RFG lets you take in the waist by up to 2" and you can specify your preferred thigh, knee, opening, length down to the quarter inch. I'm a guy with meaningful waist and hip/seat divergence, though not nearly a 10" difference like many women, and have relied on RFG to fix some issues. There are other shops in the U.S./Canada that do similar and similarly good work. RFG also carries women's cuts.  Just want to note that with 100& cotton / non-stretch fabric, you won't be able to have a super narrow leg opening since it'll be impossible to put your legs through. Relatedly, it's not the same, but maybe you can get your raw denim fix in the form of a jacket? Potentially not a Type 3 depending on your chest measurements but various other jacket iterations might be easier to size for.	episode_done:True

text:A discussion about “knockoff culture”	labels:Hot take: nothing is really original anymore, and most everything has been done before or inspired by someone or something else. For the luxury brand to automatically claim ownership simply because it's *designer* is bullshit imo.  We all know that quality differences will be present. A $3k coat isn't going to be on the same level as a $100 one. If someone wants to spend the extra money, cool. If someone likes the look but wants polyester instead and can only spend a lot less, cool. If the designer coat is really that great, there will be a market for it. If tons of people are buying the knockoff and no one is springing for the expensive version... Well, maybe you misjudged your market or overpriced your item.  I don't have a problem with knockoffs because they appeal to different crowds. Not everyone can afford a multi-thousand dollar handbag. Why should a struggling single mom who likes the design of something be relegated to a plain black bag? If she finds a similar style at Kohl's, she should be allowed to buy and enjoy it. I feel holding designer items as being superior, and then looking down on knockoffs, is classist. End of.
text:Agree 100%	labels:	episode_done:True
text:A discussion about “knockoff culture”	labels:Logos are *trademarked. Clothing designs are... a more grey area. Like, a v neck knit sweater can only be designed so many ways, you know? However there are some instances where parts of a design are copyrighted, like i think the red soles on Loubitons, which i cannot spell, are copyrighted/trademark. Prints and artwork are a whole other story.  There are a lot of factors and copyright and intellectual property law also differs from country to country - there is no international copyright law, just general agreements between specific countries.  I personally feel that knockoffs and replicas are different. Replicas are illegal as they are faking an item AND copying the logo. Knockoffs that just copy the design... not illegal, generally speaking. Ethical? Truly depends on the situation.  In your specific examples, yeah theyre probably inspired by Sezane but tbh theyre not really dupes, there are clear design differences in each example.
text:I've watched a video on this and I think you're right.  Also, I think the argument is that a knock-off is not going to steal market share from the original. Those who want to and can afford a high end designer brand aren't going to buy a knock-off and those who do probably can't afford the original.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:A discussion about “knockoff culture”	labels:I would't consider Sezane a paragon of originality at all. They are also copying someone.  Every season there is a grab bag of trends for people to interpret. This year we have big sleeves, chunky knits, and 70s office wear as the inspirations.   And each brand takes their spin, and washes it with their point of view. Sezane does its rendtiion in the classic, same for brands like J.Crew and Banana Republic. Madewell's version is a little hipster and boho takes on the same classics. Anthropogie is quirky femme takes on the trends. Gap would do the plainest version - yes to chunky knits but not super statement sleeves.  It is hard to deem a solid knit sweater as a knockoff, there are only so many versions you can make.
text:Yeah Sezane didn't invent bodysuits and pom sweaters, they're all copying from somewhere else and EVERYONE is making these. I think it's bullshit that it's only ever cheap brands that get called out.  When Sezane sells rip-offs, it's "inspired" or "trendy" (but in a ~timeless~ rich person way ofc), when a cheaper store does it, it's a "blatant rip-off" and "stolen intellectual property"? Girl, please.	labels:Exactly.  I’ve seen both things a million times before.  But it’s overpriced so I guess it’s theirs?	episode_done:True
text:A discussion about “knockoff culture”	labels:You see this a ton in the world of lingerie, maybe even more so than clothing.  I think it’s impossible for a designer to truly say they own a design element, so dupes and items that have been inspired by other designs are fine by me. If design houses are often ‘inspired’ by smaller indie labels anyway. They bring to trend to mainstream, and it filters down.   I don’t think the example you mentioned would hurt Sezane. The knockoffs allow more people to wear the trend who couldn’t afford ‘the original’ and seeing the design become really popular and trendy would probably make more people want to purchase it. The people who tend to shop from sezane or other higher priced retailers aren’t likely to buy knockoffs because they want higher quality.   The one thing I think is wrong is people selling fakes, trying to pass it off as a genuine designer item. This could either be a high quality dupe of a high end designer, or cheap amazon listings using a photo of the garment they’re copying, when the reality is they’re selling you something much worse. Unfortunately this kind of thing is becoming rampant as if you can shut down one retailer, they just make a new amazon/Ali express store and start again.	episode_done:True
text:A discussion about “knockoff culture”	labels:>there is no world in which I will ever buy a 10k coat, so buying a cheaper dupe isn’t taking business away from anyone.   Yup. How it all plays out legally, of course, is its own issue. But luxury brands are not depending on my business and I never feel bad buying copycats (of the same style, that is. I wouldn’t purchase an article of clothing with a fake logo, for instance, but that’s me personally.)   I also find that fiercely anti-knockoff attitudes can become classist very easily. And the topic of ethics in this regard really gets to me, too. I don’t think it’s fair to criticize the ethics of consumers in a rigged economy.   (Not saying that OP suggested any of this, it just came to mind.)  EDIT: this was meant to be a reply to someone in the thread, but it’ll work	episode_done:True
text:A discussion about “knockoff culture”	labels:I think it has to do with how immediately recognizable something is as being a particular brand’s, like the ever famous red sole shoes. Most companies don’t really have these kinds of easily recognized traits (outside of trade marked logos), because putting an identifying feature on everything you make severely limits what you can produce.   Most clothes look like clothes, and could easily come from any brand, and those I don’t find a moral issue with. Especially since many designs we look at and associate with a certain brand are only because we saw it for them first/associate that brand with prestige and assume they must have come up with it first. In reality, most of them are using designs that have been around and circulating amongst all of fashion, and no one can really pin point where they came from first.   Like with your example, those are two incredibly basic designs I’ve seen around for years from many different brands. I wouldn’t even be comfortable saying the cheaper brand is copying the French brand for sure and not any number of other companies. Sure, it’s sometimes very obvious when someone is getting copied, like when a Kardashian wears anything and Fashion Nova is selling it’s version the next day. But most of the time designs are kind of free flowing.	episode_done:True
text:A discussion about “knockoff culture”	labels:I can say something about this from a EU design law (very very basic) point: In the EU, if you make your design public in any way, you have 3 years automatic protection. However, to prove that the other party is infringing, your design still has to meet the minimum requirements of design law, which means that it needs to be distinctive enough. To do this, you need to consider what else was around at the time the design came out.   For the low back body suit, I imagine theres plenty of low back body suits around, and it would be really difficult to prove that Sezane had something distinctive here.   With respect to the jumper, I think that the jumper itself is distinctive, but that VICI’s jumper is different enough (only single balls, balloon sleeves) that it would not infringe either.	episode_done:True
text:A discussion about “knockoff culture”	labels:I’m clueless as to what luxury brands even exist nowadays but when I was in high school my mom and I scored a bunch of fake Louis Vuitton bags at a tourist trap shopping center and I carried the shit out of them for four years of high school and got tons of compliments. Fond memories.	episode_done:True
text:A discussion about “knockoff culture”	labels:Most designs are not unique imo.  Designs and inspiration is a grey area.  There are some situations where I can see blatant copying but they’re pretty rare.  Like if a unique pattern on the fabric is copied or something.  I’m all for affordable options when it’s not plagiarism, I love fashion but it can be overpriced and elitist.  And accessibility for people who don’t want to spend ridiculous amounts on designer clothes is a plus to me, I know that’s controversial.  Honestly some of the most heinous and shameless theft of ideas often comes from big designers.  I don’t think that first top is even something original enough to be stolen.  It’s a v backless ribbed bodysuit, right?  Common, simple fabric/pattern.  The sweater is *slightly* more unique but imo just a few common trends put together.  And the other sweater doesn’t really look much like it imo.	episode_done:True

text:Winter staples?	labels:Depends how cold it gets, and how much time you plan to spend outside! I'm a city girl and a bit of an "indoor cat," so my main winter activities involve navigating public transit, dealing with puddles of slush, and an occasional walk on icy sidewalks. We don't plan to drive or live in a detached house any time soon, which cuts out a whole category of winter chores.  So for me, staples are long wool coats, wool turtlenecks, wool socks and shiny black rain boots or sturdy shearling lined Timberland boots. For extra warmth, I wrap a wool pashmina around my head and layer silk thermals under my clothes. Mittens annoy me so I usually just wear leather gloves or keep my hands in my pockets. I find this is the best compromise to stay warm without too much bulk or any technical garments. If the pavements are dry, I'll even switch to heeled leather boots.  I've walked up to 30 minutes at a time in weather around 10° Fahrenheit in an outfit like this, with the scarf pulled up over my nose and mouth. (The normalisation of face masks will make this even easier now.) But it would *absolutely not* be sufficient for extended time in temperatures below 0° Fahrenheit, winter sports, or even for things like shoveling snow or scraping a windshield. For that you'd want taller insulated boots and a proper down jacket.	episode_done:True
text:Winter staples?	labels:How cold of a winter are you expecting?   As another poster said, fleece-lined tights and leggings are great for layering. I love them under jeans or wool skirts.   Make sure you get more than one pair of boots, especially if it snows a lot. Nothing worse than putting damp boots back on because the snow was taller than the tops!   Get warm socks! Wool is great. Darn Tough is a good brand for keeping your feet warm. They also have a good guarantee so if they get damaged, send them back for a replacement. I love knee high socks because you can layer them under jeans or work pants and stay a little extra toasty.   My staples tend to be pullovers and sweaters (Patagonia, H&M, anything wool, fleece, or cashmere that I can get at the thrift shop), jeans, full-length wool skirts, scarves, beanies that go over my ears, joggers, and boots.   Also, get a variety of winter coats if you can afford it. Peacoat for the kind of cold and blustery days. Down jackets rated to negative temperatures for when the frigid ice and snow storms hit. A canvas lined jacket for shoveling and other dirty outdoor jobs that is easy to show in the wash. A nice full-length dress coat for work or nights out on the town.	episode_done:True

text:Colour/Style Matching - How do I figure out the potential of my wardrobe?	labels:Try on lots of stuff.  Pull all the clothes out of your closet and just start pairing things up and modeling the looks in the mirror.  As a teenager, I used to read magazines like Vogue and Glamour, even the trashy tabloid magazines like Us and People, and try to replicate outfits I thought were cool with the clothes I had.  I did the same thing with Pinterest when that came along and now I do it with Instagram.  I'm not nearly as adventurous as I used to be, but I still try new things/pairings/outfits all the time.	episode_done:True
text:Colour/Style Matching - How do I figure out the potential of my wardrobe?	labels:1) The most foolproof way is to try on every combination of clothing possible. Especially the things that you’re like - there’s no way that will work. Because that’s how you discover new combinations. Or you’re like... well, that didn’t work but if the top were like slightly longer, it’d actually be amazing - and that’s a great way to build a shopping list of stuff that would work with what you already have.   2) Trying on clothes is actually a lot of work. If you’re lazy and would rather lie around instead (cough what do you mean, I’m not talking about myself at all), if you put all your clothes in a closet app (I use Stylebook) you can look at what’s in your closet on your phone and make up different combinations to try out later. This isn’t foolproof, you will need to still try them on irl to see if they actually work (although the more practice you get the better you’ll get at creating successful outfits). Actually getting all your clothes in a closet app is a whole lot of work to start tbh, but if you want to go that route I find it’s best to use as many stock photos as possible and don’t bother with background removal.   3) If you really want to be a geek and see everything in your closet laid out, do a visual wardrobe. People posted them occasionally a couple years ago so search the sub if you want to see examples - but you basically take a picture of yourself wearing every piece of clothing you own. This takes a long time but you have the advantage of being able to see what your clothes look like on you and I feel like that makes it easier to pick out good outfit combos, because at least to me, silhouette is so important. Also it’s kind of fun to see what types of clothes you gravitate towards and you can sometimes discover things like “I really need a bright yellow jacket, that would tie together so many of these outfits” or “I actually hate green so why do I own 24 green t-shirts???” that’s kind of hard to parse when all your clothes are tucked away in drawers and stuff.

For that you can also "randomize" your outfits! Count how many tops and how many bottoms you have, then let something choose 2 numbers for you (Google has a random number generator when you search for "random number"). If you get, let's say, 8 and 3, take the 8th top and the 3rd bottom in you wardrobe, then try to make an outfit out of them by choosing a jacket, accessories, etc.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Colour/Style Matching - How do I figure out the potential of my wardrobe?	labels:The first step is knowing what you have - colors, shapes/silhouettes, patterns, etc. and what makes you feel comfortable. The best outfit means nothing if you're uncomfortable/self conscious in it.  A few tricks that have worked for me until I got more comfortable with my closet and could slowly evolve it and venture out:  \- Black or other neutrals are your friend. Pair with a pop of color or a fun pattern. This made breaking things down for me much easier.  \- Find complementary accessories. Statement bracelet, necklace, earrings, scarf, blazer. Whatever you like. Even adding this one element can tie things together.  \- Try different combos of what you have together. Figure out what you feel comfortable in and what shapes work together and what colors you actually like together. One concept that works for me is if I wear more fitted on the bottom, I put something a little looser on top or vice versa.  One thing that really helped me when I had to elevate my wardrobe game for work stuff was a trick I heard they teach associates at a fancy pants store. I don't know if this is actually true but I still found the concept helpful: every outfit should have 3-4 pieces. Skinny Jeans/camisole/cardigan/statement earrings- wham! Leggings/sweater/scarf. This has helped me when I'm staring at my closet with a sweater and jeans wondering if I can do something else to snazz it up.  If you're interested in working with color, I would suggest just browsing about color theory to see if there are some ideas there that may inspire you on things that may work together. Also figuring out what colors work with *your* skintone/hair/eyes is very helpful in narrowing things down.  **That was a long way of saying, try things out and observe the types of styles/outfits you like, what works for your own lifestyle/needs, and just have fun with it!**	episode_done:True
text:Colour/Style Matching - How do I figure out the potential of my wardrobe?	labels:I'd suggest rotating your wardrobe. Every day, pick a different item that you haven't worn before and try to style it. This helps me to see the holes in my wardrobe and I get more practice matching things together too. I try not to wear the same things too often- after all I paid for those things sitting in the back of my wardrobe so I want to wear them lol	episode_done:True
text:Colour/Style Matching - How do I figure out the potential of my wardrobe?	labels:Instagram!  Seriously, it's the best place to go to for style challenges, and even if you don't want to participate publicly, you can do it just for yourself, and also great for getting a ton of styling ideas and figuring out what you like in general.  As for developing an eye... exposure to a ton of different styles is pretty helpful; it helps you develop your preferences.	episode_done:True
text:Colour/Style Matching - How do I figure out the potential of my wardrobe?	labels:1. Start slow! Save images that inspire you- whether it be print/ social media or random photos on the internet.  2. Take these images and see if there are any elements of your wardrobe that work. Eg the image shows a woman in a black turtleneck and a plaid skirt. You have a cream turtleneck But don’t have a plaid skirt. You do however a a similar style skirt in navy.  3. If I pick what to wear every morning I would always gravitate to the same items. I spend at least half an hour every Sunday figuring out my Monday- Friday outfits. This gives me time to experiment and try on new combinations. Sometimes things will work in my head don’t work in person and that’s okay! It also means that I can make sure I have the right underwear/ tights etc so I don’t panic in the morning.	episode_done:True
text:Colour/Style Matching - How do I figure out the potential of my wardrobe?	labels:Play dress up and have fun! Honestly it may seem simple, but just trying it on, and especially taking pictures of outfits and saving them for later. I’ve got a whole album of outfit photos (thanks biweekly outfit threads lol) and it helped me narrow down things I liked and didn’t like, and where I wanted to go with my style.  Also, lots of looking at outfits in Pinterest and Instagram.   Another thing you could try are 30x30 or 10x10 challenges, and find new ways to wear the clothes that you have.	episode_done:True
text:Colour/Style Matching - How do I figure out the potential of my wardrobe?	labels:Like many others have said, just try stuff on!  It can be a bit exhausting but you can pick one one item that you would like to focus on (a top that you recent bought or pants that you never got the chance to wear) and start trying on different pieces until you get an outfit that you like with that piece!  I find that this way makes the process less overwhelming and is an easy way to incorporate new pieces into your cycle.   You can also try and replicate an outfit that you see on Instagram or even google an “aesthetic” that you’re interested in with what you have in your closet!	episode_done:True
text:Colour/Style Matching - How do I figure out the potential of my wardrobe?	labels:I definitely second everyone saying to try things on and see what you like. I do that myself all the time. Even if I think something might go together, it's helpful to try things on because it's not uncommon that it worked a bit better in my head than it does in real life, and it can just enough that I don't actually really love it in person. And even with an eye for fashion (or at least an eye for what I like and want personally), I still discover pairings that I didn't think of when I go through and try on a new piece with e v e r y t h i n g I own.  I'll totally admit it's a lot of work though, and if you're doing your whole wardrobe it can easily take a full day, which is a *lot*. So one thing I like to do that makes it a lot more fun, is I'll go through and try everything one with another person, and kind of turn it into a fashion show. It can be with friends and we'll both go through our stuff and take turns posing and having fun with particularly great matches, or it can just be with my mom and super casual, but it turns it from work to get through to an activity to enjoy with someone. Sometimes that's enough to let me power through a lot (I've done a few wardrobe purges as I matured out of different stages and needed to reevaluate what I wanted), and sometimes I still want or need to break it up into multiple sessions over a few days, but it makes it a lot more pleasant overall.	episode_done:True
text:How have you changed your style and/or shopping habits after your body has changed?	labels:I went through this too, and while going through it, did an entire wardrobe overhaul. Instead of lamenting the weight gain, I chose to have a ton of fun buying new clothes for my bigger pandemic size. I’ve had a great time eating really enjoyable food during quarantine, I don’t care that I’m fat now. Also, I had been ready to re-do my style for a while, and this seemed like the perfect time.   However, now knowing how easy it is to fluctuate in size, I used weight fluctuation as a deciding factor in what I chose to buy: I only purchased items that will fit with a fluctuation anywhere from 5-15lbs (I’m 5’2). Seems crazy, but it actually is possible. I stuck to either loose silhouettes, or tight yet forgiving stretchy styles.   What worked for me in choosing what I invested in was just ensuring I put enough time and effort into the process. I downloaded Pinterest and spent an inordinate amount of time looking at street clothes, I set a budget, thought about what items I needed, and did a ton of online window shopping. Once I had a better idea of what I wanted my new style to be, I did a lot of online shopping. I did return a lot of things, but also kept a lot, too.   Think about items of clothing that you gravitate towards, that make you feel really good. Use that to form the basis of your wardrobe. The process does take time and effort, but doing enough prep before buying will really make the process way easier.

text:How have you changed your style and/or shopping habits after your body has changed?	labels:I'll add my 2 cents as someone that went through a big weight change about 4 years ago and how I've accepted/adjusted to it.  Until about 35, I weighed 110 and my concerns were always about trying to add curves with clothes since I had no butt and a flat chest.    A few lifestyle changes...I quit smoking!  I started working from home (so similar to what people are experiencing now) and I went on birth control.  All those factors together lead to a 50lb weight gain in about 6-8 months.    At first I didn't believe what my clothes were telling me.  I thought oh these jeans must have shrunk or those always ran small.  I was still cramming myself into size small or extra small tops because it was all I had ever worn.  Then one day I saw my own reflection in a window and thought "that poor girl needs to just go up a size or two" and then I realized it was me.  I used to love body hugging clothes like close fitting turtlenecks but now they just accentuate the parts of me I don't like.  I've switched to flowy tops and sweaters.  I used to avoid maxi dresses if I couldn't wear a push up bra because they made me look sooo flat chested.  Now I love them and its so nice not worrying about bra straps or a strapless constantly sliding down.    The biggest obstacle for me has been to stop fixating on the size on the label and just get the size that looks and fits the best.  I also was really motivated to lose weight for a little while and still bought the smaller sizes even if I could barely get in to them.  I lost a little of what I gained but I think my body is just happier at the heavier weight.  I think I look better too but it was hard giving up the "I'm the skinny girl" identity I had for so long.	episode_done:True
text:How have you changed your style and/or shopping habits after your body has changed?	labels:Hmm, not sure I have a lot to contribute but I have had to change my style quite a bit on a few occasions in my life in the last 5ish years, and it's left my closet in shambles. First was when I moved from a trendy college town to a trailer on a ranch (lol, I f***ing hated it). So all my cute shit went bye bye and I basically only had clothes I could feed pigs and cows in. Then I moved to kind of a trendier metropolitan suburb and got to wear nice things again, then moved to a very casual city and had a baby, so all my cute stuff became ugly casual stuff again. Still trying to sort things out so I can look good and feel good while balancing my new lifestyle, new body, and the local culture.	episode_done:True
text:How have you changed your style and/or shopping habits after your body has changed?	labels:Looser fits, and more stretch in fabrics, I like dense fabrics but it needs to have some stretch (I can't do 100% cotton denim). This way my clothing works for a few sizes, though they do have an ideal fit. I'm 5'0, hippy, and have some bad stomach issues that result in extreem discomfort and bloating, and just a strong desire to live in sweatpants sometimes. My diet has been pretty good over the pandemic because I have been trying to identify what foods don't make me feel like shit and 4 sizes bigger, but in the before times when corporate lifestyle ment lots of dinners and drinking, looser silhouettes saved me.	episode_done:True

text:I love the eye for clothing that will fit with a weight fluctuation -- especially since I am now trying to be a bit more conscious of that! Do you have any particular examples of items that have worked well for you?  I think part of my problem is that the silhouettes that used to work for my pear/hourglass body now do not at all with a bigger stomach, and it's slow to figure out what will. The other part of the issue I'm finding is that clothes quality and silhouette fit is a challenge in plus sizes for me, even with brands I trusted before. I'm having issues with things riding up or sliding down over time even when they seemed my proper size.	labels:I’m also an hourglass/pear! In terms of oversized fits, I made sure everything I bought hit me at my smallest spot so that it looked correct for my shape. For example, I bought an oversized cashmere sweater, and it ends mid thigh. I wear it with tight pants (I often follow the baggy top/loose bottom vice versa) and a shoe with a heel to balance it out. The sweater is big enough to fit a huge weight range and still look good. Oversized is in, and I think it looks trendy.   In terms of plus size clothing, I haven’t yet ventured into that because I stuck to brands that offered already oversized clothing. The sweater I mentioned is Ben Taverniti (bought on deep discount) and was already marketed as oversized, so I bought the biggest size and it fits great. It’s an easy way to not have to find new brands or learn how to style yourself with plus sized clothing.	episode_done:True
text:How have you changed your style and/or shopping habits after your body has changed?	labels:As I gotten older, my weight has mostly gone to my thighs. So my emo/scene skinny neon jeans didn't really fit. I've also kinda changed how I view myself in general. So I've kept the music but changed the pants. I wear a lot of high waist loose/straight leg pants now. Most of my pants aren't jeans either. I've really gotten into other fabrics.	episode_done:True
text:How have you changed your style and/or shopping habits after your body has changed?	labels:So my weight fluctuates quite a bit- I've gained and lost the same 20 pounds since high school. I'm not very tall so it means about a size or two difference in clothing. I basically just keep all my old clothes since I'll probably eventually fit in them down the line.. whether they're too big or too small. This is not an issue with looser clothes, but can be annoying with bottoms. My jeans collection is massive.	episode_done:True

text:How have you changed your style and/or shopping habits after your body has changed?	labels:I’m in your boat and have been for several years now. I was usually between 140-160lbs and a solid hourglass until I was around 23-24 thanks to a combo of PCOS, hormonal birth control, and wedding planning-induced stress eating. These days I float between 220-230lbs and most of my weight hangs out in my belly so I look pregnant lol. In my thinner days I liked form-fitting pin-up style clothing. These days I tend to go for loose, flowy blouses,flannels, and sweaters.   For pants I discovered the joy of stretchy paper bag style pants over the summer and in the fall/winter I do anything black and high-waisted. I still refuse to give up skinny jeans though as I detest anything flared. I swapped H&M out for Torrid and I still get most of my clothes at Target as they usually have decent options for work clothes. I’ve recently discovered that Old Navy makes the best fitting, AFFORDABLE jeans for me.	episode_done:True
text:How have you changed your style and/or shopping habits after your body has changed?	labels:Mainstream fashion is so much more inclusive these days when it comes to plus and mid size women I don't think gaining weight really makes a difference in the majority of cases.  Women who carry some extra weight are no longer designated to day floral vomit and glo tunics, empire waists, shark hems, polyester and doleman sleeves.  They can wear crop tops, high waisted pants, athleisure, alternative fashion ect.  Even high fashion is coming around somewhat.   This is especially true in the USA where 70% of people carry extra weight.    I think the way you feel about your body is important when choosing clothes.  Many women think they look worse in fashionable and attractive clothes than they actually do.  When women feel insecure they often hide behind their clothes instead of using their clothes to express themselves.	episode_done:True

text:Let's talk about sneakers	labels:Probably depends on where you live.   When I was in elementary school in the 90's, the chunky adidas were popular like the superstar. In middle school, the nike AF1s high tops were really popular and also the K Swiss sneakers and the Phat farm ones (throwback). But they resembled the classic adidas stan smith/superstars. In high school, I remember wearing really chunky "skater" sneakers and slip-ons. I remember wearing DCs. In college it was the chucks. Then after I graduated it was those suede vans, and the slip on vans as well as the keds. Now I see a lot of stan smiths, superstars, AF1s, chucks, common projects and those adidas NMD / yeezy. I have yet to encounter more than a hand full of people wearing those big chunky sneakers at all. Only a few who were tourists.  TBH it just feels like everyone just wears whatever the popular sneaker of X company is, and since all of the above are still around, and because social media bubble aesthetics influence groups of people to choose whatever shoe suits them from whatever popular company, the outcome is that all of those sneakers are still very much alive and kicking....	episode_done:True

I've also seen a lot of those gray and white Pumas, not sure what the style is called.   I wear sneakers to work (Dr's office) and found the Reebok Man's World sneakers to have a similar look to AF1s but with a more unique vibe! I also love Saucony Shadow originals, but that's less of a trend and more of a personal favorite because they're the most confortable shoe I've ever owned. I get a new pair whenever I like a new colorway.	episode_done:True

text:Thank you! Textures is one of the things I struggled with for the longest time, I think the thing that helped me the most was jut going for the dumb statement pieces (velvet blazer, the skirt that has a ton of different textures in itself, lace) rather than buying the same mostly cotton/jersey basics.  Cozy fits are my favourites :)  I have a bunch of cool rings, so when I’m in the mood I’ll just put all of them on. But I don’t really see them as part of the outfit since I’m not picking them specifically based on what I’m wearing, if that makes sense? I wish I was more of a jewellery person, but the stuff I like is a bit expensive and I’d rather spend that money on clothes, and I’m also so lazy in putting it on.

text:Covid Dilemna - Finding my style	labels:Yep, I frequently play "dress up" in my own clothes and take pictures to analyze. If it's an option, you could try borrowing clothes from a friend or family member to try on and do the same. Remember to try different styling tricks, too, like rolling sleeves, belting, cuffing pant legs, etc or even pinning at different lengths or fullness to get an idea of what those silhouettes look like. It's not the cheapest, but you could also rent clothes or just buy and return. I'd only do that if there's something you want to try that you don't otherwise have access to, though.	episode_done:True

text:Covid Dilemna - Finding my style	labels:I have been using Le Tote for three years now as a way to try out new styles. It’s a rental box service, but it has “normal” clothes - things I would wear to the office or to dinner with the hubs. Even during quarantine I’ve continued because it gives me new things to look forward to wearing without the need to shop outside my home. And I’ve found brands I really like that I wouldn’t have discovered in my normal routine of Target and JCPenney runs.   I discovered I actually can wear column dresses with my super curvy silhouette as a result. And I’ve tried cropped pants, cold shoulder tops, paper bag waists (they are awful on me), and all sorts of trends I would never have purchased without wearing for a day to make sure it worked for me.  I average 2-3 boxes a month with 5 clothing items, so that would be a slower but safe way to try lots of things.  I’m not trying to spam or anything, but I do have a promo code that gets us both a discount, if anyone has interest.

text:Covid Dilemna - Finding my style	labels:I got to do some of this in store, and honestly that was a lot easier. But when the stores closed, I ordered stuff online and tried it on at home. I ordered from Zalando, which has a ton of different brands and free returns. Trying clothes at home was pretty nice, because I could take it in for as long as I wanted, get back to some stuff on a different day and pair the new clothes with my own to see if it made a good outfit.   When you're just starting out though, it's important to actually try out a lot of different things. Don't focus on clothes you might want to buy, just get some plain things with different necklines, fits and materials to see what looks good and what doesn't.  Once you have narrowed that down, you can look for more interesting stuff that actually fits your style. So if you do this by ordering online, make sure returns are easy.   If ordering online is not an option, maybe you can borrow some clothes somewhere? Shirts, dresses and skirts also can be pinned to change their shape. And if you have old clothes you don't wear anymore you could cut them into a different fit. Things like cutting a crew neck shirt into a V-neck or a maxi dress into a midi or mini, or shortening sleeves. If you're handy with photoshop or something, you could even try that.

text:How do you know if a piece of clothing is worth its price?	labels:Honestly, I think if an item brings you joy, fits your budget, and you’re sure you’ve got things to wear it with then it’s ‘worth’ whatever the price is.   I try to spend more on things I’m sure I’ll wear over and over. Like my fake leather jacket I’ve worn every cool day for eight years finally started cracking on me so I decided to throw down the money on a good real leather replacement that will last me a long time. Same thing if I wear through a favorite pair of jeans or have a specific style of top I know I love wearing. Those things are worth the extra cash.   But for a trendy thing I just want to experiment with? I see no harm in tossing out $20 on it, seeing just how often I wear it and then buying a higher quality version later if it starts to wear out. I try to limit these purchases so I’m not wasting money on a closet full of trendy stuff I never end up wearing but I still spend $20-$30 on a new “it” item to feel like my wardrobe is getting refreshed each season.   Tl;dr life is short, value is subjective. If that cheap forever 21 cardigan is calling your name then get it even if you know it’s not gonna last forever. So long as you actually wear it and enjoy it then it’s not money wasted.

text:How do you know if a piece of clothing is worth its price?	labels:I agree with the comments that suggested thinking about how often you’ll wear it, more so than the price. I used to prioritize price, but ended up with low quality clothes that just didn’t last. Now i find myself passing on some items even if they’re really cheap, just because it seems like it won’t last. I try to pick clothes by their fabric composition and pay attention to the details (stitching, closures, etc). For jeans I look for as high % cotton as possible. I like linen, rayon, modal and cotton for other pieces. I usually avoid nylon-y and thin, fast-fashion pieces. Then I think about whether that store usually has sales, if so, I wait. I very rarely get anything full price because there’s always some sale!   I’m usually willing to spend more on “core” pieces that I’ll wear all the time, like a coat, jeans, or work pants/shoes. For statement pieces or trendy shirts I usually wouldn’t spend that much. I think it just depends on how many ways you can style that item.  As for a&f and hollister - I have personally found really great quality clothes there. For a&f i love their linen pieces, jeans, pants and sweaters. They also have awesome sales. As an example, in september i got 2 sweaters for like 15 each, jeans for 40, and pants for 20ish from there, all really good quality, and I wear them often. For hollister, it can be hit or miss since it’s more casual, but I have blouses and jackets from there from several years ago still look new, but they weren’t expensive. Sorry for ranting lol!	episode_done:True
text:How do you know if a piece of clothing is worth its price?	labels:I work in fashion and you’re spot on about the acrylic. Very uncomfortable fiber to have as a primary content on a smooth fabric. Fine if it’s in a yarn...I would say knowledge about fiber content is key, which you seem to be aware of.   There are no hard and fast retails as markers for quality in fashion. I have Uniqlo jeans for $20 that have held up pretty well. I’d say you’re spot on again when you ask about brands in this respect. Some brands offer customers a great value AND value their customers.   I agree with the comments here that say if it sparks joy and you wear it, then it’s worth the money, on both the low end and the high end.   However, shopping online can be extremely deceptive sometimes. In my experience Free People is one is the biggest offenders in this. Their stuff just looks horribly cheap once it’s in your hand.   So something that sparks joy in on a model in a photo might not once you get it home. I’d just say shop with your heart and be prepared to make returns.   Personally, I shop vintage a lot and I am pretty selective about the brands I buy new from.	episode_done:True
text:How do you know if a piece of clothing is worth its price?	labels:My policy is that I refuse to buy anything that I’m not absolutely sure that I’ll love. I see a lot of people fast fashion shame by saying that “people never wear those things more than once or twice” but while I try to avoid fast fashion now for ethical reasons, there are definitely things I’ve purchased from shein, H&M, etc. that I wear all the time.	episode_done:True
text:How do you know if a piece of clothing is worth its price?	labels:Cost per wear!!   T = How many times a year will I wear this item S= How much? W = worth  S/T=W  EX. Leather boots are $120 (S) Will probably wear them 3x a week for 6 months so that’s 78 round up to 80 times. (T)  120/80= $1.50 per wear  EX.2 Cute summer dress: $200 Will wear once a week for 6 weeks it’s warm where I am. If I find that many excuses to wear it. So about 6 times this year.   200/6= $33 per wear  After a while, you’ll start seeing prices based on cost per wear. It’s helpful to start yearly, but after a while you’ll be able to gage how long the item will last, then you can really do cost per wear.	episode_done:True
text:How do you know if a piece of clothing is worth its price?	labels:A fair amount of what makes a garment last/wear well is how you take care of it.   Extremely cheap fast fashion like YesStyle is going to wash/wear poorly, so you need to be very gentle with washing those kinds of garments. Hand washing, coldwater washing on low speeds, and air-drying will make those kinds of garments last longer. I have 10-year-old Forever 21 dresses because of how I wash them.  For American-made brands, I like LA Apparel and Bug Bud Press. However, keep in mind that these brands are expensive for a reason, and they have fewer styles and sizes for a reason. To try and understand clothing price and quality, try and think about how can this YesStyle dress possibly cost $11? How long does it take to make a dress, what would I like to be paid for making a dress, how much does fabric cost per yard, how can this brand afford to make this many styles, colors, and sizes? You'll realize that the only way for a garment to cost that little is because corners are being cut SOMEWHERE.	episode_done:True
text:How do you know if a piece of clothing is worth its price?	labels:I used to work for a wholesale company and know how much some items are marked up buy our clients and that has ruined shopping for me. So I say, don’t depend on the brand but on the item itself. I actually have shopped at YesStyle for some tees and I like the quality cause they are thicker than the tees in the US.	episode_done:True

text:How do you know if a piece of clothing is worth its price?	labels:Other than figuring out the cost per use I tend to make a list of items I actually need/want and then try to only buy things from that list regardless of the sale. In my eyes a piece of clothing is worth it’s price if it is firstly something I need and secondly something I will use often.	episode_done:True
text:What true heirloom pieces do you own and how do you incorporate them into your style?	labels:A little different but I own several saris and a couple of lehengas, some of which were my mum's and some from my grandma on my dad's side.  With my mum's, I like to style them as she wore them which is pretty traditional and really lean into the 80s style with fluffy hair and major winged eyeliner but I normally add a statement piece of jewellery to make it mine.  My grandma's I tend to mix up with different styles of blouses, different scarves and wear as more of a mishmash to fit in with the trends at the moment. One of the saris she gave, I've had made into a lehenga with two different blouses and the skirt into a ruffled, almost flamenco kind of skirt because the material really suits that kind of thing.
text:That's so cool!!! I don't know much about how saris and lehengas changed in style over time, but I LOVE the idea that you had one of the skirts made ruffly!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What true heirloom pieces do you own and how do you incorporate them into your style?	labels:My grandmother was incredibly stylish and had amazing taste in clothing. When she passed I was able to go into her closet and take what I wanted before her kids donated everything to Goodwill, so I have all these gorgeous coats and blouses of hers...that I have no idea what to do with. I need to alter pretty much everything if I’m going to wear it but I am terrified of ruining anything of hers...so currently it’s all just hanging in my closet making me miss her whenever I see it, which is probably the worst of both worlds. If anyone else has been in a similar situation I would love advice on how to seek out vintage alterations or how to find a really good alterations place.	episode_done:True
text:What true heirloom pieces do you own and how do you incorporate them into your style?	labels:My heirlooms came from my grandmother, who was 5'2" in heels. I am built the same way, but have more inches than she did... so alas, that gorgeous Burberry trench coat simply cannot be made to fit.   However, Gram was a collector of cashmere and one of those people who believed that if you like a thing, you should have one in every color, and two in the colors you like best, against it wearing out. I have a handful of her sweaters, some of which are from the early 70's. These sweaters were everyday wear for her, and it does show, but they are SO soft and SO luscious that I wear them around the house on a regular basis. My cats don't care that they're two inches too short and have holes at the hem.   I did inherit some of her jewelry, including her engagement ring, which was put in a setting that my grandfather designed. Sadly, resizing the setting to fit me would have destroyed it, so I have that put away until I find a jeweler I trust to make it into a necklace with a new stone. I have an AMAZING opal bracelet of hers, also my grandfather's design, a silver wire cuff with the opals set in as the body of a spider. Gram never told my grandfather that the thought of a spider on her wrist freaked her out- she rarely wore it. I never met my grandfather to tell him how cool I think that piece is. Looks amazing peeking out from under the lace sleeves of my favorite LBD.
text:Same on the cashmere in multiple colors! My great aunt didn’t have kids, so I got some of her clothes, including 3 cashmere sweaters from Jacobson’s (probably late 60s) in red, black, and grey. They’re a cropped boxy shape with a mock neck, and I love them.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:I’ve also inherited cashmere sweaters in all different colours. My grandma loved turtlenecks though so that’s the only format. On the plus side they don’t have any holes and they fit me just fine.  When I was younger and she gave them to me she would go on about how great the quality was in those sweaters. I, knowing nothing about quality clothing being a teenager, just nodded along and shrugged. Now when I’m older and seen the prizes for new quality cashmere, I feel a lot more appreciative. I’ve made it a point to thrift non-turtleneck cashmere sweaters though.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:What true heirloom pieces do you own and how do you incorporate them into your style?	labels:many moons ago my mother took a trip to the British Isles and came back with two of the densest wool sweaters you'll ever see in your life. i'm talking chunky, itchy, but so incredibly cozy. i have one and she has one, and she doesn't even really wear hers, but i loooove mine on a cold day. makes me eager to go traveling (lol thx covid) whenever i wear it!	episode_done:True
text:What true heirloom pieces do you own and how do you incorporate them into your style?	labels:I have a pair of beautiful caramel taper-toe Dex riding boots that my mom bought in 1970 with her first paycheck. She gave them to me when I was in high school in 2007 and I wore the soles out from wearing them so much. I paid $30 to have them re-soled with leather in 2012 and my mom was so shocked because that's how much she paid for them in the first place.  But these boots are so special to me and not a single thing could ever persuade me to get rid of them.	episode_done:True
text:What true heirloom pieces do you own and how do you incorporate them into your style?	labels:I have a few of my moms high school sweaters/cardigans from the 70s (including the one that was part of her cheerleading uniform)! They’re well made and fit perfectly. They look quite preppy, so I usually pair them with jeans and a T-shirt.	episode_done:True
text:What true heirloom pieces do you own and how do you incorporate them into your style?	labels:One of my great aunts gave me a great silver and turquoise matching ring and bracelet set she got out West probably in the 50’s and likely as a souvenir even though it’s nice quality silver and real turquoise. I also have a small beaded purse from her, it looks quite older, maybe 1930’s. I only use it for special occasions and otherwise it just sits on my dresser looking pretty. The same great aunt was the oldest of my grandmothers siblings and gave them fancy dresses from a lady she worked for to play dress up in. Later my mom played dress up in them and so did I. I wish we had realized how nice they were because they’re in rough shape now even though I’ve saved them. They’re probably 1920’s, one is silk and could possibly be repaired enough to look nice displayed.   My mom did her own sewing and saved a lot of her favorite clothes. I still wear some of her 70’s maxi dresses but she wore her dresses too short in the late 60’s for me to wear most of them as an adult. There’s one wool jumper dress I wear over leggings.   When I was in high school I wore her 1980’s Calvin Klein jeans, the ones with the white labels instead of the modern leather patch.   My aunt gave me some of my grandmothers costume jewelry and it started my love affair with tacky mid century jewelry.	episode_done:True
text:What true heirloom pieces do you own and how do you incorporate them into your style?	labels:I wear and use my heirloom pieces inherited from my grandmother very often .  Have not altered any of them , since some of them are quite old and it would ruin the historical value .  My most interesting pieces are : A solid gold cameo set with of earrings, necklace , brooch and a ring that originaly was my great-great grandmothers , and a ruby pendant in silver from the same era (1880s 1910s) And a brooch from the napoleonic era wich is quite interresting.   My style of dress is a mix of bohemian with a good deal of influence of Edwardian (1910-17ish) sensibilites, so the jewlery work really well with that. Also have a gorgoues 50’s swing dresse that was my grandmothers, wich i have worn on ocassion. Edit to say that my grandmother was my same exact size when she was younger , so thats really fun, the clothes i have after her fits me PERFECTLY wich is great luck!  A bit controversial but i also inherited my grandmothers furs, they are still in excellent condition and i wear them almost daily in the winter months. But despite the ethical ramifications i am a firm beliver in sustainability , its better to wear and repair existing clothes then buying new .   I love the feeling of continunity i feel from wearing these treasures, that am a part of a long line of women who have worn these pieces, loved and cared for them.	episode_done:True
text:Purses: Real vs. Faux Leather?	labels:Personally I try to avoid faux if possible. Real leather lasts longer, faux leather is just plastic and I find it cracks and/or scuffs usually within a couple years. Granted, I haven't bought any luxury faux leather so maybe that would last longer. Also on the sustainability side I feel like real leather is better (although I'm sure it depends on processing and where it comes from)
text:Leather production is really terrible for the environment too, but since it lasts a looot longer and afaik is waaay more degradable, it's still by far the more environmentally friendly choice unless you purchase a whole lot of it.	labels:To add to this, there are places that offer vegetable dyes and make sure that the tanning process isn't bad for the workers and the environment.  You can also try to find brands that use recycled leather or use secondhand leather to lessen the environmental impact.   And ultimately, it will eventually biodegrade which is something I can't say about my peeling, sad faux leather jacket that I've only had for 3 years!	episode_done:True

text:Purses: Real vs. Faux Leather?	labels:I can’t stand faux leather. Not for shoes, bags, clothes; anything. Plastic can start to degrade after some time (6-10 years). I had some faux leather hiking boots that turned to mush just sitting in their box in my closet. The handles on faux leather purses start to peel and the bottoms wear very fast. They simply do not hold up like leather.  I have vintage Dooney&Bourke leather bags that are 25+ years old. I keep them polished, clean and in dust bags when not in use and they look new.  If you can afford a genuine leather bag, even secondhand, it is the best choice imo.
text:I have had mostly leather ( good quality) bags over my lifetime.  They usually last about 6 years or more of daily wear before they are worn enough to replace, or another workhorse bag catches my eye.  If you like to change bags with outfits, or seasonal, I prefer relatively inexpensive ones to fill in, like straw, cloth, novelty.  I keep those under $20-$30 range.  One way to pay less for good quality are thrift stores un upscale areas.  My last bag cost $30 and was retail $600 Italian leather.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Purses: Real vs. Faux Leather?	labels:If not going to use real leather, then great quality fabric is a better, more stylish option, than pleather/ fake /faux leather in my view. Oiled canvas, linens, weaves, neoprene, canvas, polyesters etc, look great, and are often combined with leather or other kind of handle or strap details. Longchamp set the standard for these kind of bags.

text:Purses: Real vs. Faux Leather?	labels:I find real leather looks much better in person compared to faux leather and will age much better year over year. A faux leather purse can look nice when you first get it but it will quickly be obvious it's of cheap quality and that can make an outfit look blah whereas a good quality leather bag can elevate an outfit and make you feel chic and hold up year after year with proper care! I find a real leather bag is more sustainable as well since you wouldn't need to repurchase it again soon compared to the faux leather which would not hold up as well over time and thus you would need to repurchase over and over.	episode_done:True
text:Purses: Real vs. Faux Leather?	labels:Honestly, if you’re willing to spend the money on “luxury faux leather” just get the real thing. It’s more durable, able to be restored, and you can actually take care of it in a way that will make it last longer. No matter where you get faux leather from, it’s just plastic at the end of the day. Luxury faux leather is just plastic with a designer label on it.

text:Purses: Real vs. Faux Leather?	labels:For me, (retired, age 75) real leather bags are not an investment I would make now. In the past I was able to find excellent vintage Coach bags at consignment shops at a great price. One of these is still in rotation. My current favorite bag is “pleather” cost $15.00 new, and has good zippered pockets. It actually looks decent and definitely classier than the price would suggest. The chief advantage of this bag is that it’s durable and waterproof when set down in rain or snow. One drawback of both real leather and faux leather bags is they’re heavy.  A wonderful alternative to both real and vegan leather is nylon, such as Baggalini or Haiku brands.  Light weight, practical sizing, fun colors and quality construction. Just not waterproof enough for winter wear where I live! Fun question 👍🏽	episode_done:True

Mostly I live in shorts and skirts, but there is also something comfy to me about wearing something longer and which kinda hugs your body. But when you're celebrating a holiday that revolves around eating a huge meal, it's pretty much the worst thing. Everyone in pants just sitting around being uncomfortable after the meal until they leave Grandpa's house and finally get to undo their fly. Lol. A loose dress does sound a lot more pleasant.  While I transitioned years ago, I usually see conservative family on the holidays, so I still try to dress up en masc, and it's a little ridiculous. Will be nice to have a smaller gathering with just close fam this year (siblings and my mom only, all of whom live together).	episode_done:True

text:Influencers with Jobs: A Brief Collection	labels:Love this - similarly, I work in a 9 to 5 office job (during Normal Times) and as much as I would love to, I can’t wear heeled OTK boots and a tiny shoulder bag to the office lol. For the weekends, sure! But that’s a minority of outfits.  I may be old school, but I still follow blogs as well as IG / YT:  9to5chic: OG officewear blogger, she used to work in marketing at a medical company, is now a marketing consultants  Feather Factor, she’s focused on her recent book now but was previously a product manager after earning her MBA from HBS.  The Luxe Strategist: Very thoughtful posts on finances, shopping and general lie stuff.  I’ll also add ExtraPetite / Jean Wang, though ever since she started blogging full time, her outfits aren’t nearly as consistently relevant for workplaces.  Also, pantsfessional is great - her posts got me interested in learning sewing, which has been a saving grace these past 8 months.  I’ve noticed with some of these, it’s less so ‘daily OOTD’ content and more often than not, a weekly/monthly cadence of varied content. Which might not fit the ‘influencer’ definition, but I still enjoy reading / consuming it!

text:The Style Blogger Index: finding people who are the same size as you	labels:It's really interesting how someone with my height, size and even shape can be so different from me. I am right now quite into the Kibbe body type system, so it's helpful to understand that someone with my size and even same waist/bust can have a completely body structure (for example I am frame dominant and am visually wider and my bones are blunt, while someone else may be flesh dominant and have a very rounded frame, or might have quite sharp long bones, or a juxtaposition of both). This can make the same item of clothing look so different on two people.	episode_done:True

If they weren’t hot and young, the same outfit would get dragged. Like mom jeans and a giant tucked t-shirt that looks like it came from Walmart and we’re raving about Bella Hadid’s style. I find it very hard to find fashion influences for adult women that aren’t super basic, skewed super young, or just generic preppy “put a blazer over it!” J-crew style. The only place I see any creativity at all is in super high end fashion, but that’s not within the reach of most of us. The whole fashion industry in general is skewed so young, it’s like after 30 they think I should just wear a sack. The only reason the super high end brands cater to an older demographic at all is that older wealthy women are the only ones that buy their clothes.

What feels truly soulless to me is trying so hard to appeal to someone else in that you lose a sense of self.  Be bizarre and outlandish. Just do it for the right reasons. Wear your witch hat and make petticoats cool again. Fashion is not the enemy. Small wardrobes and neutrals are not the holy grail. Finding out that some people try to cheat and buy their way to an image doesn't matter. You can still make it awesome.

text:You rock. That is your style! Dressing eccentrically suits you, your personality, your profession, your passion - and you do it expertly with the knowledge and eye of a textile specialist. I think OP is talking about the trend of people paying tons of money to emulate the eccentric look without understanding any of it. Their goal is simply to project an image, not to express themselves. They're poseurs who collect a hodgepodge of fashionable pieces but never manage to come up with an ensemble that is really them.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Anyone else feeling incredibly disconnected from the 'fashion world'?	labels:>I've started to notice a trend which I can only describe as 'no substance' and how this has become more and more common  YES and it's not just in fashion, but blogs and vlogs in general. So many blogs are exactly the same, it's like they're all just copying each other. So many posts are just ads. I don't mean they *have* ads, I mean the entire post is just an ad for something.  I can only assume they've witnessed other influencers' success and are trying to replicate that for themselves. They don't understand most OG influencers worked for years to add value and build a following before they ever saw a cent. They're trying to skip to the end by following proven formulas and packing their content with as many ads as possible. That's my theory, anyways.	episode_done:True

text:Check out french fashion instagrammers, if you are looking for chic classy fashion and more mature style. My own style is very verstile, from grunge to street to preppy to vintage to classy chic. I am 30. Everything works for me, and I get insparation everywhere, though I do control the amount of skin being shown in my own style, comparing to these younger "influencers". Also I eliminate fast fashion from my menu. And most of inspo these days come from japanese magazines like Fudge or from Pinterest, not instagram. French chic fashion is the only type which worth checking out on insta. Oh also some girls with very cool 70s like inspo style are pretty cool, but it's not something I d wear. The only minus is that they are all way too skinny, as someone in a normal body weight, I find these influencers , not depending on their style, almost unrelatable.	labels:[INVALID]	episode_done:True
text:Anyone else feeling incredibly disconnected from the 'fashion world'?	labels:I too am bored to death of the French classic look, the Tik Tok youth trends, the Everlane normcore.   Someone recently recommended Amy Smilovic of TIbi here and I’ve gone in deep, haven’t felt this inspired in a long time.   On her + Tibi’s Instagram she espouses what she calls the “Creative pragmatic” look and articulates nicely many things, like what makes clothing “stuff or style”, does a lot of bolder silhouettes that somehow still work for everyday and uses styling to bring out personality.   Frankly, I haven’t seen anyone be so clear on why sometimes you buy an item you love that feels stylish but as soon as you use it in your daily life it just feels off or not as impactful.   It’s also been helpful for me to see for once how pieces are worn on actual people and not just models. For the first time it’s like I can see where these higher end looks could translate into real life.	episode_done:True
text:Anyone else feeling incredibly disconnected from the 'fashion world'?	labels:I think it depends on who you follow on social media and where you go for inspiration. There are so many communities and designers that are doing crazy cool stuff that's very indie and original. Check out vfiles, designers like Didu and Area.  If you feel disconnected, try reframing your perspective and look for people, communities, and designers that draw you in and connect you.  I feel that with the barriers to entering the fashion world being lower than ever before, I continue to be inspired and amused :)  For example, I came across a designer who constructed fashionable corsets from Nike shoes. How innovative and sustainable!	episode_done:True
text:Anyone else feeling incredibly disconnected from the 'fashion world'?	labels:I've never been interested in anything home related (to the point where I will likely never own a home, by choice) as I spent every weekend of my childhood on some home project.  Enough is enough!  While I'm now WFH (so what I wear does not matter) I've noticed that fashion as of late is simply butt ugly.  The oversized boxy neutral aesthetic is just blah to me.  THe last time I really liked some of the trends was around 2014-16 when things like skater dresses/skirts (you know things that actually had a shape to them that was not a paper bag).    Now the trends remind me of that scene in The Little Mermaid when Ariel first becomes a human and they dress her up in an old beige sail and make it fashion.	episode_done:True
text:Anyone else feeling incredibly disconnected from the 'fashion world'?	labels:I live in France and there is definitely a big push on instagram via influencers for 'nouvelle vague' 60s-70 styles to be promoted as 'french/parisienne girl style' even though that is not actually what most French women wear,  but it is a style category that exists here. I like certain elements of this style but there are intellectual experts in recent years that have shown that the marketing push of this image nationally and internationally had lead to a lot of erasure of the diversity of French population. Luckily more and more media outlets are trying to show the diversity of French style. I love 'Dress Like A Parisian' blog that really instills how stylish french women create their style no matter what kind style 'identity' they gravitate to.  As for sources on instagram/pinterest etc. I have several: In terms of RTW,  I'm not the biggest fan of Hedi Slimane but his Celine collections since 2019 are very wearable and what I could see certain French demographics wearing. And I mine older Isabel Marant (pre 2015-2016) for inspiration to satisfy my bohemian itch. Other RTW I like is Dries Van Noten, Chloé, Old Céline, Virginie Viard's Chanel. On instagram, I follow certain hashtags of certain brands (typically high mid-end/independent designers many of them French)  to see how smaller influencers style certain brands.  Concept stores/Large mulit-brand boutiques also do a great job on insta with styling which helps me hone in my style. I still use Pinterest but it's easy to keep seeing the same pins to repin and it ruins the search for inspiration so I like mine instagram more and more often.	episode_done:True

I wanted to see which are not really used,  which I must change a bit (maybe dye it a different colour, maybe get it resewn) and what small purchases would really make a huge difference in my wardrobe (a belt, a skin coloures tshirt, a scarf in a certain colour etc) It made me realize I have more than enought cool outfits to last me a whole season, eventhough my wardrobe is not big at all.	episode_done:True

text:How do you find your true style when you're surrounded by fast fashion?	labels:What makes you feel like you look amazing? What garments give you a confidence boost just putting them on? Conversely, what makes you feel like a dork?  Figure that out first. Don't worry about any influences or whether something is in style. How does it make you feel?	episode_done:True
text:How do you find your true style when you're surrounded by fast fashion?	labels:Figure out what style the clothes you don't wear are, separate them into season based styles then figure out what the opposite would be.     I love my alternate post-modern goth-punk vibe with a sporty twist, think Pinks early music career with less pop-punk and more punk-rock.	episode_done:True
text:How do you find your true style when you're surrounded by fast fashion?	labels:I feel this! I’ve been frustrated with browsing slow fashion/ethical niche brands lately, because while not fast fashion, they seem incredibly expensive and visually underwhelming for the most part. Shapeless and baggy just doesn’t look effortless on my body, and I’m far too grown to be going about half naked.   My solution has been looking to eras before fast fashion for inspiration, and learning about historical/couture techniques to sew myself the pieces I’m envisioning if I can’t thrift them (you could always get a tailor to make you something to fit too). Sketching has helped me a lot to think through shapes, colors, and how they look on my frame. It could change your perspective, instead of seeing clothes on other people and imagining yourself in them, start with a picture of yourself and imagine clothes that would make you comfortable and confident.	episode_done:True
text:How do you find your true style when you're surrounded by fast fashion?	labels:In my experience, style is more about HOW you wear your clothes than it is about the clothes themselves. My advice is to start with items you can wear every day like accessories, footwear, outerwear, hair/cosmetics that fit your style so you can mix those with your current wardrobe instead of having to buy a ton of new stuff all at once again.	episode_done:True
text:How do you find your true style when you're surrounded by fast fashion?	labels:I suggest you to watch movies or tv shows. If you find a style you like, no matter the time period, you can get your own style from that.  Two of my favourite style icons are Katharine Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart, the classic style is just perfect. Find inspiration in movies, it's way better than social media.	episode_done:True
text:How do you find your true style when you're surrounded by fast fashion?	labels:I think it can be useful for someone like you to look back at your favorite trends you've jumped on the bandwagon for. If you were really into cutouts and cold shoulders, maybe your style will end up playing with silhouette and shape a lot. If you loved mom jeans, think something vintage-inspired. Look at your closet and mark out everything from the past year. What do you still like?	episode_done:True
text:How do you find your true style when you're surrounded by fast fashion?	labels:There's a lot of good advice about finding inspiration here but what really helped me is in some ways the opposite: allowing myself to be really picky.

text:How do you find your true style when you're surrounded by fast fashion?	labels:For me it came with age. In my teens and early 20s I wore the same sorts of things my friends did. By my mid 20s, a lot of my style was influenced by bloggers (just before the social media influencer era, when fashion blogs were at their peak).   But I eventually got used to spotting what looked good on me, what didn’t, what I actually liked the most and what suited my lifestyle.   I’m 30 in a few weeks and I don’t follow current trends. I wear the things that work for me.	episode_done:True
text:How do you find your true style when you're surrounded by fast fashion?	labels:I came to that realization a few years ago too, I used to be really into Zara and H&M and all that bs. Basically I've found a few specific brands and stores I really like, (Reformation, Realisation Par, Anthro, and Rokit Vintage to name a few) that I follow, focusing on sustainable/vintage/consignment shops. I get a lot of ideas from social media, my friends (I'm lucky cause they're mostly art students so they're always looking cool), movies (old and new),  and also just people watching. Like if I'm on the subway and I see someone wearing a great coat, I think about what I like about the coat (fit, color, silhouette, etc.) then I might go thrifting and try to find a similar piece, or a piece that has an element of whatever I liked about the inspiration piece. I did a wardrobe overhaul recently and I started with basics I loved and just built my way from there. It's hard to avoid trends entirely, but if you focus on what you really are attracted to you're bound to find your style. There's a lot out there, just keep looking for it!	episode_done:True
text:How do you find your true style when you're surrounded by fast fashion?	labels:i found my style basically by getting pinterest.  when you get pinterest, there are either two ways you can find outfit inspiration that you like. the first way (which someone already mentioned) is looking up movies, tv shows, singers etc. that have a style that you genuinely like and then create a board for fashion. the other way is to just search for different styles (i can give you a whole list of styles to search up if you want). after that, your pinterest will start recommending you more things to you.  some examples of things i would personally look up are "beabadoobee outfits", "euphoria outfits", "the craft style"  finding brands is probably the hardest part for me be size the style that i like isn't as common, but if your style is a bit more out there, you should find small businessesm i especially like instagram for that. i actually found some that i like from some photographers that i follow. as well as that, i also knew some from influencers, including heaven by marc jacobs and unif.  edit: also second hand apps are very good for clothes. depop is where i get most of my second hand stuff but ebay can occasionally have very good things for pretty cheap!! once i found authentic prada jeans on there for $45, gucci pants for $15 and more.	episode_done:True
text:[Serious answers only] FAQ: Why does runway fashion looks like nothing you'd ordinarily wear on the daily?	labels:When I watched The Devil Wears Prada, I thought Miranda Priestly explained it pretty well for a plebeian like me:  "'This... stuff'? Oh. Okay. I see. You think this has nothing to do with you. You go to your closet and you select... I don't know... that lumpy blue sweater, for instance because you're trying to tell the world that you take yourself too seriously to care about what you put on your back. But what you don't know is that that sweater is not just blue, it's not turquoise. It's not lapis. It's actually cerulean. And you're also blithely unaware of the fact that in 2002, Oscar de la Renta did a collection of cerulean gowns. And then I think it was Yves Saint Laurent... wasn't it who showed cerulean military jackets? I think we need a jacket here. And then cerulean quickly showed up in the collections of eight different designers. And then it, uh, filtered down through the department stores and then trickled on down into some tragic Casual Corner where you, no doubt, fished it out of some clearance bin. However, that blue represents millions of dollars and countless jobs and it's sort of comical how you think that you've made a choice that exempts you from the fashion industry when, in fact, you're wearing the sweater that was selected for you by the people in this room from a pile of stuff."

text:[Serious answers only] FAQ: Why does runway fashion looks like nothing you'd ordinarily wear on the daily?	labels:Fashion is to style as reading is to wisdom.  If you only read the rainbow press you're not gaining wisdom.  Likewise if all your contact with fashion is the fast fashion catalogs you're not gaining style.  Still reading comes at different levels if you give a book by let's say Boudrillard to somebody who never read you're not doing them a favor.  Same with haute coture.  People need to already have a fashion framework to understand it.  Also if you read something and just vomit it out again verbatim at the next opportunity you definitely don't demonstrate any wisdom.  Same way if you copy a model's clothes you're not getting her style.  The way reading furthers wisdom is because you would try to integrate ideas of what you have read into your existing cognitive framework, and the effort you spend on your framework improves it.  Same with fashion, you integrate inspirations from what you see on the runway into your existing stylistish framework and the effort you spend on it improves it.	episode_done:True

Theatre that makes you think about the world differently might not be the ocr you put on for a roadtrip.

text:[Serious answers only] FAQ: Why does runway fashion looks like nothing you'd ordinarily wear on the daily?	labels:I always think this question is framed oddly (and I know you’re not the one framing it), because I have never seen a runway show that didn’t have at least one piece I would wear in my everyday life, just not with all the other pieces and the makeup and the hairstyle and the jewelry and the shoes. (With the exception of bridal and evening wear collections, of course.)
text:I totally agree, even if it’s a gown that I would have to save for a formal wedding or something. But that’s bare minimum, there are usually plenty of things that I could wear in my every day life.   I think the people who don’t understand that fashion is art are the same people who don’t have the vision to notice that a single piece could be worn by itself if styled differently and look almost standard.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:[Serious answers only] FAQ: Why does runway fashion looks like nothing you'd ordinarily wear on the daily?	labels:I think you're thinking either avant garde or couture runways? These are different from regular season fashion shows. Mainstream labels like Gucci, Versace, Tom Ford, etc show very wearable pieces in their regular fashion shows IMO.  Now designers like Iris Van Herpen and Guo Pei do very couture almost avant garde fashion that is not meant for daily wear. These fashions are more for their high end clients who want to be inspired and who may place orders for their pieces as a COLLECTORS piece.

text:Do you feel the black Friday sales better or worse than usually this year? Is it worth to buy clothing you won't wear until next year?	labels:The sales are about the same as last year. The difference IMO is they’re starting earlier. I think you should only buy if you actually have a need or function for it.   I’ve bought the Sheertex tights so far.

I’ve been in the market for a camel coat and black leather jacket for a couple years, but haven’t found the perfect one to pull the trigger on either yet.

text:Do you feel the black Friday sales better or worse than usually this year? Is it worth to buy clothing you won't wear until next year?	labels:Maybe this is just the stores I'm looking at, but it seems like the new stuff that I'm actually interested in isn't on sale this Black Friday, but everything else that's not as good is 40% off. It's annoying, because splashing a big number like that ("30-50% off the whole site! \*exclusions apply") draws me to their site, but the items I actually want aren't a part of the sale.  The only exception being Levi's because I've been waiting for this 40% off sale to get a pair of Wedgie jeans.   Not going to lie, I did buy quite a few bits from the sales this year but with the intention of returning 90% of it because I don't feel comfortable going into stores to try stuff on. Best to buy everything I want to try on at sale prices then return what I don't want to keep!
text:This has always been something I hated! I also think that Black Friday sales are overblown and actually not that good (for clothes). I typically wait until January to shop for sales because that's when retailers are trying to dump inventory to make their year end numbers look better. (Fiscal year for retailers ends in January and doesn't follow the calendar year.)	labels:Oh that's a good idea! I can reliably count on shops like Madewell, Levi's, Abercrombie & Fitch, etc. to have sales at the end of the season. The only problem is whether or not they'll have my size when the sale happens or if they're sold out of everything except XS and XL...	episode_done:True

Immediately when I walked in they had portioned off tons of racks for their off the runway selection or something. Well. I tried on everything I wanted. True runway brands. Dresses skirts, shirts, sweaters everything... And I almost cried. They were all so beautiful and colorful. Everything fucking fit. I was just blown away. The construction was perfect, the silk was the softest ever... And I nicely put it all back on the hangers and hung everything back up where I found it... It was like my own personal runway in the dressing room. When I left however.. I was definitely upset.

text:Has anyone else ever tried on a designer item just to see what the hype is about?	labels:I don't even have stores like that anywhere close to where I live - but I DO try on stuff from thrift stores that would be out of my price range new, and that's how I learned about higher quality garments.  For me it's more about the materials and construction than brand.  For instance, I learned the value of real wool, silk, etc. from gaining experience with them through thrifting.  Same thing with really good structure, weight, stitching.  Sometimes it's a brand I would never be able to afford new, like JCrew or Loft, and sometimes it's just a vintage piece from the 1960s when clothes were more likely to be made of natural fibers and be really solidly constructed.  My favorite thing I learned about was what cashmere feels like to wear!  I can now just go into a thrift store and run my hands down the rack until I my hand feels merino wool, cashmere, real silk.  I've also gotten better at identifying them by sight.  I'm also more likely to shell out for one nice new item in a natural fiber from a brand with a reputation for durable, long-lasting clothes than to buy a whole wardrobe of "fast fashion" stuff.  I'd rather wear the same two merino sweaters in just two colors I love all winter (in a classic cut I can wear for years) than 20 "fashionable" cheapy synthetic sweaters that are "in style" for this year.  I still stay away from purely luxury-type brands, though, as they are both out of my price range, and because I think I can find stuff that's functionally almost as good without the markup for being brand name.  I've also finally recognized that it is worth it to take care of natural fibers properly and doesn't even take much time (especially considering I need less clothes overall because these wear more often better).  Thrifting is my friend!	episode_done:True

text:Has anyone else ever tried on a designer item just to see what the hype is about?	labels:I've always had a penchant for oversized, long coats-- even before they were a trendier piece. Several years ago, I was walking down Michigan Ave in Chicago with a decent amount of money burning a hole in my pocket. Naturally, I tried on a $5,000 Bottega Venetta coat that SCREAMED my name from the rack.   The fabric, weight, feel, and look were so so so much nicer than any other coat I had ever warn. Before I even saw the price tag ( I thought it must cost no more than $1k bc I'm an inexperienced dummy), I felt so luxurious and confident in it.   I'm still trying to capture how good I felt in the jacket in my day to day life. Truly life changing.	episode_done:True

If you're uncomfortable sticking out from the crowd then I would recommend shopping at popular stores within your age group and age market, and buy pieces that suit you but are also in line with the general style. You can also dress basic/minimalist and stand out with your accessories.	episode_done:True
text:How to build an age-suitable varied chic wardrobe?	labels:I am a lot older (in my 30s) but in grad school and a lot of grad students also dress in athleisure. I also want to not draw too much attention so here are some of the things I do to dress down: 1. White trainers (Veja) with an otherwise dressy outfit, instead of black leather shoes 2. Pairing formal button-down with ripped or faded denim (more casual) 3. Wear loose outerwear (flowy) rather than a tailored coat or jacket 4. Add some pattern even if it’s basic like stripes, dots, plaid  5. Wear slightly cropped length pants, slightly cropped tops and sweaters with high waisted pants  6. Drop sleeves make everything look casual  7. French tuck / half tuck is more casual than a fully tucked in top  8. I’ve been wearing a lot less makeup since I’ve gone back to school - concealer, blush and mascara is a more youthful combo than eyeshadow, eyeliner, lipstick	episode_done:True
text:How to build an age-suitable varied chic wardrobe?	labels:>French chic and preppy school girl  Have you ever heard of the brand Claudie Pierot? It's suitable for your age, but it's really perfect for this. It's probably too pricey, but maybe you can copy that style elsewere. Also, I am East Asian - women tend to look very young and our fashion is geared a lot towards looking youthful as well. Maybe you can get some inspiration with how we style stuff too.  Anyways, I remember how hard it was as a teen to hear "dress however you want and don't worry about it" from people and have it mean anything (hell, that's the case for me even now in my mid-thirties). So I'll just say this - people will definitely notice if you dress differently than them, but they are less likely to think you're trying "too hard" if you don't act differently (better or different than them, seeking validation, etc. etc.) because of how you dress or if you avoid drawing attention to your clothes specifically (like name dropping brands or styles or being not willing to go certain places or do certain things because you're not dressed appropriately).	episode_done:True

text:this is sort of like what happened to me too! i turn 30 in a couple weeks (help) and have never identified with the idea of feeling "too old for" any fashion trend until the latest series of 90s trends started hitting stores/social media. some of it it does look cute on today's teenagers but it reminds me too much of my mom's style in the mid-90s for me to feel motivated to wear it myself. had my fill of it the first time!!	labels:	episode_done:True

text:haha weirdly i thought that about high-waisted pants when they first came back when i was a teenager. It took me a while get rid of the association with my mom who was a bit older than most and unironically wore mom jeans.   I love Y2K style though, even though i remember wearing bootcut jeans dragging around in the mud when i was a kid. luckily the trend is also towards short pants lol	labels:Yes!! as a petite I can not begin to count the number of times I walked home from school or a friends out with soaking wet pants halfway to the knee.

text:Agreed. I’m 31 and I LOVE some of the current trends out there. I just style it a bit differently to fit the needs of my job/life and comfort level. I might focus on colour and material over cut, or get the cut in a less overt colour.   There’s only so much longer I can maintain abs. People can pull the crop tops out of my cold, dead, hands.	labels:	episode_done:True

I am definitely not planning to wear low rise anything again, but I would wear boleros, the mod influenced stuff, shiny and space print fabric, and bootcut jeans with tunics again. I don't want to dress like or be 2004 ModestMalka again, but I feel that I can dress like a woman my age would have dressed at that time instead.  You're 23 though, that's the perfect age for this stuff. I deeply regret trying to grow up too fast in my early 20s, selling or donating my fun clothes and then going out in polo shirts and cardigans for 6 months.	episode_done:True

No shoes, except to get another pair of running shoes.	episode_done:True
text:DAE feel they made incredibly ODD fashion purchases, this year in 2020?	labels:For me, 2020 was not much different to any other year!  Little Old Lady here, one friend, no family.  All my clothes buys are always utility.  This years were two pull-over hoodies, a sweatshirt, two cardies, a jacket, three flannels and another shirt, a pair of jeans, two pairs of cargoes.  All charity shops except one of the cargoes.  All will get worn until unwearable as usual.  Mostly slightly different things to what I have worn for years.  Don't think for any reason, just things I saw and liked.	episode_done:True

text:DAE feel they made incredibly ODD fashion purchases, this year in 2020?	labels:I’ve bought two new items of clothing all year. A new winter jacket and a fleece for skiing. That is really unlike me. I’m not usually a big shopper but going almost a whole year with 0 new clothing purchases that aren’t utility based is really unlike me. However, it does give me a new perspective knowning I’m fairly happy with my wardrobe and I don’t need anything new. Looking back on this year there was only two events I would have for sure needed new clothes and those were both formal events that were cancelled.	episode_done:True

You could try looking into more goth websites maybe? Like black milk always releases velvet collections about this time, especially if burned velvet is your vibe
text:I too want to chime in that I don't think there was shade, and that I, too, believe velvet is a staple fabric that should be available 3/4's of the year.  My personal white whale is silk velvet - it is impossible to find.  Now it is all viscose with 6% silk at most.  Bring. back. silk. velvet.  It is why vintage dresses of yore were so drapey and sumptuous.  Edit: try Eileen Fisher's velvet pieces.  You can always find them pre-worn and in resale.  They hold up very well..  I have machine washed many a piece and they look perfect. It's also a great way to find office-appropriate velvet pieces.  Velvet dresses are a basic necessity.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Does Anyone Ever Feel Like It’s Hard to Find Basic Clothing Items That Were Plentiful in the Past?	labels:When I was younger it was a lot easier to get basics in neutrals and a variety of colors from brands with “better” quality. This was common at every price point from discount to mid-range.   Now the mid-range is terrible quality. And the brands know for basics focus on neutrals and 1-2 seasonal colors.   As for your comment on Velvet dresses? Those tend to be pretty seasonal - for holiday parties. And this year there won’t be many holiday parties so brands likely scaled back their social occasion collections this year.	episode_done:True

I don't see men getting hassled for the amount of electronic waste their hobbies produce.   I doubt every fifth post in the Funko Pop subreddit is about curbing consumption and how they should be rethinking their involvement in a plastics based interest.   Personally, I think they're wasteful as shit, but I'm not about to roll up into their space and shame them for it.  I'm so over the handwringing, guilt, and joylessness about fashion in this sub sometimes.
text:I was SO surprised when I came to this sub and thread comment after thread focused on purging, and capsule wardrobes, and minimalism. As some one who regularly keeps articles of clothing for 7+ years by caring for it well I just Do Not Relate and also do not want to!	labels:On the point about caring for clothing, I do NOT understand when people post about clothing disintegrating in the wash. Like. How is that even happening?!
text:They're either incapable of understanding the basics of doing laundry that even a teenager can manage or they're lying, girl.   Any excuse to distance themselves from the poors and justify overpriced clothes because paying over $100 on a shirt means it's "better quality" than the $20 all the poors can afford. It's not.  They're just treating their cheap clothes like shit because they're cheap. The name brand stuff gets handwashed with angel tears by virgins with long hair in sundresses. Then they're surprised pikachu when the H&M sweater pills and the Sezane one does not.   Or even better, the h&m sweater is *obviously* shit because it pilled, but when your sweater is $300, pilling is suddenly "inevitable" and just use an electric shaver.	labels:Someone asked how to avoid sweaters disintegrating in the wash, so i asked what they meant, and they meant literally just pilling.  So I guess you're spitting truth lol

text:How many pairs of jeans and pairs of shoes should you own?	labels:I think it's interesting that you hone in on "needs" when for many people fashion fills a hybrid function of both hobby and utility. Both shoes and purses seem prone to being "collector's items" moreso than other garments (leggings, sweaters, etc.) and it makes sense to me as a fashion hobbyist and collector that people would have more than they "need" or use regularly. Also, as people age they typically gain more buying power, space to store things, and access to various occasions (business events, formal events, lifestyle changes that may necessitate a wider variety of things to fulfill a wider variety of functions).   Furthermore, I haven't found this sub's focus on "purging"/closet cleaning reflected in real life--while people do obviously consign or donate old clothing, it's pretty common for people to keep things or simply put things in storage as their use wanes. So on that note, it seems unsurprising that people have a handful of things that see constant rotation and a handful of things that are rarely used but are still enjoyed, so there is no reason to get rid of them.

text:Fwiw I know at least two men who own a ton of shoes and hats. As in 50+ pairs and a store rack worth of hats. One of them collects sneakers as a hobby while the other just likes his shoes and hats to match every outfit. I would guess it's similar for women who own a lot of purses.   I personally don't like purses at all so I only have one for when I absolutely have to (dress codes at fancy events, weddings etc). With "nice" shoes it's hard to find any that are remotely comfortable, so I see a lot of women buying various pairs of torture devices in hope of finding the perfect ones, only to end up with a ton of impractical footwear that never gets worn. I myself own 3 pairs of ballet flats that give me blisters and I haven't got rid of yet. But then if I'm invited somewhere I won't have any nice shoes and idk if I should keep the toe blisters ones or the heel blisters ones or the ones that fall off my foot every other step.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Women with ADHD & Sensory Processing Disorder: I need Clothing recs!	labels:This is a comforting thread despite talking about discomfort!

text:Women with ADHD & Sensory Processing Disorder: I need Clothing recs!	labels:I was just thinking about this the other day because i feel like I have cracked the code! Maybe I'll do a whole post sometime. I'm also in the cusp/extended sizing realm of things.  Caveat - i only buy second hand, generally from ThredUp.   Favorite brands:  J.Jill and PureJill. I hear they have good sales if you prefer to buy new. Most items dont have tags at all, a LOT of 100% cotton items, and things are soft and loose in the best way. Partly because all sizes run half to a full size large.    Max Studio runs smaller, but they also have some extremely soft fabrics, and they have really good options for those tight skirts that you can wear with leggings and loose tops.    Eddie Bauer runs fairly large, very few synthetic blends, easy to find super duper cheap second hand.    More generally, I look at fabric content. Usually with my trusted brands and ALWAYS with anywhere new.  I find that the closer I get to 100% cotton or cashmere for things that Im wearing next to my skin (tops and dresses and sleep clothes) the more I go to that item over the long term.    I also like Aerie for underwear and leggings. A lot of seamless options and breathable fabrics.    And finally - sending so much love to my sensory sensitive ladies!

text:Casual Fridays - What do you like to wear?	labels:I haven't worked in a proper business casual place in a long time. My office is casual and I tend to dress up.   As mentioned, it depends on what level of casual is implied. I always took it as sort of one casual element, and the rest is regular business.   So I feel like you can do a couple of angles.   One of my favorite angles is a fancy version of something casual. E.g. a jogger in a trouser fabric or a shirt dress shape in a nicer fabric (like a wool knit, or some sort of jersey knit or silk. Or a shirt dress but with sheen.   The other angle is one casual element with a dressy outfit. E.g. nice dress with fancy sneakers. Or jeans with a blouse, blazer,  and "nice shoes."  Or maybe a sheath dress with a moto or jean jacket.   My default work outfit is usually a dress, and I feel like depending on the shape it could either go casual or dressy. And it jut ends up being a lot easier for me. I have dresses that are a bit more casual and ones that are a bit more fancy. The fancy ones get a casual piece and the casual ones get a fancy piece.	episode_done:True
text:Casual Fridays - What do you like to wear?	labels:I work in an engineering office, where the men usually wear a dress shirt + pants Mon-Thu and khaki + polo on Fri. My interpretation of “casual Friday” isn’t necessarily dressed down, but showing more of my personal style. I usually wear neutral coloured blouse + skirt, and on Fridays wear the same type of outfit but with a brighter colour and/or louder pattern, with bolder accessories.   Eg. Thursday is blue striped button down shirt and black pencil skirt. Friday is buttoned up Kelly green cardigan with a panda brooch, and shorter houndstooth a-line skirt.	episode_done:True
text:Casual Fridays - What do you like to wear?	labels:I see business casual as an opportunity to express yourself a bit more. My casual Friday go-to is jeans (because I don't normally wear those M-TH) and a trendy sweater or blazer w/ men's type shirt under-- coordinating belt and accessories are a must for me no matter what day. Pair this with casual flats or boots. My Friday looks are less stuffy than my M-TH attire. I work in higher ed; it's not suits level attire M-TH, but managers on up shouldn't be wearing jeans during the week at my place of work. Friday is where I show a bit more of my personality. I never knew I had so much to say about casual Friday attire. lol	episode_done:True
text:Casual Fridays - What do you like to wear?	labels:I have three basic outfits I go towards for casual Fridays depending on the time of year and plans:  * Long flowing maxi-dress with a longline blazer. With comfortable shoes. * Fitted Midi-dress. With comfortable shoes. * High waisted jeans, a dressy top/knit jumper depending on the weather and oversized blazer. With comfortable shoes.  All of the above are a marked improvement on my usual silk shirt, midi skirt, blazer and heels combo. I will note that I'm more inclined to go with either of the first two options. These are my preferred silhouettes.  I also go slightly bolder with my necklace choices. Instead of my usual gold Common Era necklace (which I wear every day), I go with my more colourful Lizzie Fortunado options.  My goal is to be my more colourful self, just a very polished version. With comfortable shoes.	episode_done:True

I've also worn said boyfriend jeans with a lavender terry cloth cropped Nike sweatshirt over a white button down and brown ankle booties.

text:Casual Fridays - What do you like to wear?	labels:I rarely see people dressed in business formal unless it’s a huge meeting, so most days it’s business casual.

If it’s a holiday or no one is in the office, I’ll put on a button down that’s half tucked in with jeans and I’ll wear ankle boots. I’ve seen people show up in leather or suede jackets on Fridays, but they’re not wearing it the entire time indoors. Depending on your role, T-shirts under a blazer is fine.	episode_done:True

text:I'm both obsessed with jumpsuits and I pee a lot. Not the best combination.   My compromise is that I only get jumpsuits that I can pull on and off. if there's any buttons or zippers I have to fiddle with it's a hard no.   I don't wear them when it's cold out either.

text:Yeah totally agree. Recently I got one from a friend's closet cleanout that actually flatters my body, and I think it's because it's very flowy and loose so the size difference isn't an issue. Regardless I would never buy one without trying it on first because that's literally the only jumpsuit I've ever tried on that didn't awkwardly ride up my crotch and make me look like a toddler...	labels:I’m smaller on top and my favorite thing in the world right now are drop crotch jumpsuits, totally solves that problem.

I miss those sweaters. I have not found anything close in 2 decades to replace, but as a petite my options are usually limited to black, grey, and just one trendy color that sells out super fast.	episode_done:True

text:I'm a J. Crew loyalist, so I'm acknowledging my potential bias but I'm also a fan of Banana Republic and went through a hardcore BR phase. However, I've kind of forsaken Banana (my young professional wardrobe was full of it) and returned to even more J. Crew -- I've found that, in general, my pieces from J. Crew last longer and hold their shape/quality more than what I have bought from Banana. Also those 50% sales are usually goldmines for me! Just my experience!	labels:I loooove BR - they’re in my price range and their clothes just fit me well - but quality is absolutely hit or miss.

text:The wildest thing to me is that Madewell has really consistent sizing and I'm able to order online with confidence about what will fit. I have ordered a bunch of things and haven't needed to return or exchange a single one. By the end of last year, J. Crew was the most inconsistent sizing of any brand I think I've ever encountered. I could take 15 items of the same size into a dressing room and all 15 of them would fit like shit in totally different ways. It means online shopping is essentially unavailable to me - in this economy, no less. They've maintained those price points while spiraling out re: their supply chain.	labels:I feel like JCrew *used* to be more consistent. I used to have faith that a size 6 Perfect Shirt was, indeed, a perfect fit for me. I owned three of them in white alone. That hasn't been the case in recent years, and it's a shame.   Besides inconsistent fit, there's also just been some bizarre merchandizing decisions. Last March, right before all this (gestures at 2020) went down, I went into a JCrew looking for work pants. I did not find a *single pair of full length pants.* I mean, I can understand gearing up for spring, but ... no pants? at all? Some decisions just don't make sense.
text:Yeah, I went in there looking for a classic, flattering suit a couple of years ago, which was something they used to do really well, and they didn’t have a single normal suit. They had some mess with an oversized double-breasted jacket and Capri-length pants, another with a ribbon on the jacket that you were supposed to tie into a bow instead of buttons. Like, why?	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What do you like, fashion-wise, about loose-fitting clothing?	labels:A loose-fitting garment with the perfect drape does a lot of the same things a well-fitted garment does; it conceals what you don't want to see, enhances what you do want people to see, and leads their imagination to fill in the gaps with the best possible things.     My personal problem is that I've got a small, tidy waist paired with bulldozer hips and a substantial hip dip.  I find that wearing skirts that gain fullness just a few inches below the waist will help smooth out that hip dip so that all people see is that va-*voom* created by my waist-to-hip ratio.       I'm also a huge fan of knitted tops with batwing sleeves, since they almost never have any of the sleeve fitting problems that you often get in made-to-wear clothing, and that batwing... if it's  a cropped shirt, or it's tucked into a high-waisted skirt, trousers, or belt, creates a line pointing straight to my waist that I'm probably emphasizing anyway because it's my only good feature.     Also, gigantic, hideous sweaters.  Like just a huge pile of ugly with legs and a head poking out.  That is some real luxury right there.	episode_done:True
text:What do you like, fashion-wise, about loose-fitting clothing?	labels:I totally understand your mental block—I’m in the same boat! I recently started following Amy Smilovic on Instagram (founder of Tibi). She talks a ton about how “flattering” isn’t worth making your decisions on! I’ve found her view really refreshing. You might enjoy it as well!	episode_done:True
text:What do you like, fashion-wise, about loose-fitting clothing?	labels:I love loose shapes, but particularly the ones that are a little rigid and architectural, rather than something that hangs. I think it’s nice to wear something where the garment is the focus, not the body underneath it.   For example, I have a boiled wool cape/poncho piece I wear a lot because it is SQUARE and the neck is a stiff funnel and the sleevey parts stick out at an angle from my arms and that is what you see when you look at it, this interesting shape. It’s impossible to tell what my body looks like at all and I find that comfortable and kind of freeing.   I also love wide-leg pants for the same reason. People see the shape of the pants, not the shape of my thighs and butt.   I have a pretty average-looking body and I just have never enjoyed people noticing it (and frankly, I don’t think it’s very interesting, nor do I feel more attractive when it’s clearly visible.) I just don’t really  *care* if people think my waist isn’t small enough or my butt isn’t big enough or whatever. Especially if I think the piece of clothing I’m wearing is interesting even though it hides my boobs etc. I kind of prefer people to compliment my outfit over how I look in the outfit, idk.
text:This makes a lot of sense. It reminds me of talking to a friend who sews all her own (very structurally rigorous) clothing. She says that she finds it more exciting to hide her body in interesting ways than to look conventionally attractive.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What do you like, fashion-wise, about loose-fitting clothing?	labels:There's something between form fitting and loose fitting and it's skimming the body. This looks more like that.   Skim fit can include looser fit items that aren't intended to be overly baggy but aren't intended to be skin tight. u/amelisha is describing this well, but also think about Audrey Hepburn and Jackie O and how their clothes fit them. They weren't skin tight. They were skim tight. Aka as "fitted."  We don't see that as often today with stretch being built into every fabric, and tailoring (beyond hemming) being rare.	episode_done:True
text:What do you like, fashion-wise, about loose-fitting clothing?	labels:Took me a while to appreciate that loose != ill fitting and form fitting != well fitting. For example, that jacket accentuates the model's waist, is a good length in the arms, flatters their neck, and has a lot of interesting structural details and textures. The idea for me isn't baggy for bagginess sake, but usually some interesting structure or contrast in tandem with a more fitted piece or the natural outline of my body.	episode_done:True
text:What do you like, fashion-wise, about loose-fitting clothing?	labels:I’ve heard a lot of the rule that it helps to balance an oversized piece with a slimmer fitting piece. While the theory is good I think it helps to remember when you’re balancing, that the slimmer piece does not have to be skin tight. I feel weird and sausagey if I wear legging-tight pants with an oversized top - so I like to think of it as oversize top balanced with straighter, slouchy but not palazzo-wide pants. I think one super tight piece and one super oversize looks a bit dated and I find the in between to be more chic!  Also this is just a personal preference but as a curvy gal I like to show my ankles and wrists and it helps remind me that I am not actually a blob. I love ankle length pants and rolling my blouse sleeves just to show my wrist. I think it makes it look very easygoing and laid back :)	episode_done:True
text:What do you like, fashion-wise, about loose-fitting clothing?	labels:There are some clothes that look good when fitted at the right place and good when not fitted at the right place. It's all about the place. A flowly dress looks amazing when the fit is right around the tiniest part of your waist. Meanwhile, a bodycon is fitted all over the body and it really looks trashy in my opinion. And since it's fitted everywhere, you look wider around your waist and basically, you just look like an oversized banana. I am very critical of bodycon kinds of dresses.	episode_done:True
text:What do you like, fashion-wise, about loose-fitting clothing?	labels:I also stick with one loose item and a more tighter item to balance it out. I like wearing a blouse with loose sleeves, tucked in a high waist skirt or pant. I do the inverse too, wide leg/loose bottoms, with a tight shirt/blouse. I think I would get overwhelmed if everything was too tight or too loose.	episode_done:True
text:What do you like, fashion-wise, about loose-fitting clothing?	labels:I have always preferred dresses and skirts to wearing pants; however, I find that they can make a person look "overdressed" in a more casual setting. If I wear a loose-fitting or oversized dress then I look like I put some effort into my appearance without being too dressed up. I also love oversized/loose-fitting pieces with weird structural details or unique drapes. Sometimes these pieces are not necessarily "flattering" per se but I enjoy them because they are comfortable enough to get shit done in while still looking somewhat interesting. I agree with other commenters, sometimes you want to draw attention to your clothes rather than your body parts.	episode_done:True
text:What do you like, fashion-wise, about loose-fitting clothing?	labels:I’m pear shaped and wear tons of loose fitting blouses/sweaters- I balance them out by wearing skinny cut pants or by doing a French tuck.

If you double it up, there isn't much length left after having knotted it. It looks a bit as if I'm using electrical cable to hold up my jeans but I think it's cool.

text:To me a shrug is something you can literally shrug on/off. So often no arms and definitely not something you'd have to pull over your head. Searching for shrugs brings up a lot of evening wear (faux fur type things) and maybe some mini cardigan types that don't button closed.   A bolero would be a jacket or something that's more like a proper item. It closes properly and it's harder to put on/off. As someone with a short torso I often find bolero jackets fit me a lot better. I think the ones in OP's album would fall under bolero to me.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Kibbe System and Body Inclusivity	labels:I have negative associations with it because 99% of the time "red pill women" (or other women with deep issues) are the ones saying good things about it.  When I hear "Kibbe" I immediately think "red pill".
text:I had no idea it was a red pill thing, that's so off-putting. I wonder what attracts them to it specifically?	labels:My (uneducated) theory is that they just want a quick hack into being a hot/well dressed/groomed woman. They don't want to put in actual work or effort, they don't have style so they want to check box A or box B and have someone figure it out for them.   tldr: lack of taste and no interest in fashion but they want to be fashionable.
text:It's not just a lack of interest and taste, it's a straight up disdain for fashion as a hobby. They view women who care a lot about fashion and makeup as shallow, vapid whores. But they also feel obligated to look attractive to men. So they need an "easy" fashion strategy that will help them look pretty and feminine and classy, but not in a way that suggests they put a lot of effort into it. Red pill women aren't the only ones who buy into that line of thinking but they're definitely more overt and conscious about it.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:I had no idea it was a red pill thing, that's so off-putting. I wonder what attracts them to it specifically?	labels:As someone who was raised in a conservative religious household and who fully bought into the red pill women BS in my much younger years, u/PartyPorpoise hit the nail on the head. And to add to that, fashion for the red pill women isn't about personality, individuality or art or anything avant-garde, it's about looking "hot" as defined by society at large (aka men). The Kibbe system gives a sense of right/good/attractive vs wrong/bad/ugly in fashion. It's about being told how to dress (something I got a lot of from church) rather than discovering one's style for oneself.	episode_done:True
text:Kibbe System and Body Inclusivity	labels:Honestly, I ran through it because I like taking quizzes, but I wasn't impressed. I got an even split of C, D, and E answers with 2 B answers, which wasn't one of the options for the results. I looked over a couple of the closest ones and they didn't seem to fit me at all, so I dunno. Either I'm bad at judging myself or this quiz is a bunch of baloney...	episode_done:True
text:Kibbe System and Body Inclusivity	labels:I've taken this quiz a dozen times in different platforms and my largest gripe is still the same. I'm not white and I'm really not sure where to put myself in this system, especially regarding facial features.   The descriptions say "exotic" or "not too exotic" features. I feel they are referring to more striking features, perhaps something a high fashion runway model may have (exaggerated lip shape, dramatic cheek bones, aquiline nose) but what do I do as an east asian person? My nose and eyes are smaller than the reference photos so I am automatically labeled "delicate"?   The label names are pretentious (flamboyent natural?) but I think there's potential. It could be a fun tool to chat about fashion. It could help people understand themselves better. It can't be worse than our current terminology of fruits and objects. It just needs to be expanded and updated.	episode_done:True
text:Kibbe System and Body Inclusivity	labels:I got to the third question and couldn't answer it. My arms are very long and thin but my legs are short and thick so. That isn't an option I guess lol.  Like most body typing quizzes I think its pretty much BS. This one is just complex BS lol
text:I felt the same thing! Like none of the answers felt right and all of the resulting body types were very idealized?	labels:They also, frankly, overuse the word flesh.
text:Yes! Also “lush,” like I’m not describing myself as “lush and fleshy” ever	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Kibbe System and Body Inclusivity	labels:First of all, the Kibbe system is too dated to work - if you look at the suggestions for clothes to know what they are talking about, they usually involve dated styles. And the types I fell into the most - gamine and theatrical romantic - featured images of women who were heavily styled, whilst writing about those features as if though they hadn't been altered in any way. Didn't help that said women were from the 50's and most of the photos weren't even colored.  It is also sexist, but in a weird way. Like, if you look taller than you are or have long arms and legs with a short torso, then you are automatically 'masculine' - the opposite is also true, that stockier women are considered feminine (?). It's categorization is usually wrong.   I could go into the descriptions of the types I fell into, but I won't - they made me angry in their weird, smotheringly obsessive way, of describing traits, as if though you were a perfect fairy tale character in a book written by an incel.   This all combined with the fact that the people who take these tests are usually clueless about style, means that they will probably end up either confused or use a very limited way of expressing themselves. And so it appears with those who write about Kibbe in the first place - it's the blind leading the blind.   It's like those apple, pear, hourglass, thing yet again. They sound like all of them safe for hourglass, are freaks of nature, whose exaggerated proportion frighten everyone unless they are covered up. Only Kibbe takes the opposite position, where slight variation in how you are built, must be exaggerated hugely, yet again in the name of being harmonious.   It just doesn't work that way - almost nobody has this thing, where their face and body fit together in 'type', or at least I sure as hell don't.
text:>I could go into the descriptions of the types I fell into, but I won't - they made me angry in their weird, smotheringly obsessive way, of describing traits, as if though you were a perfect fairy tale character in a book written by an incel.

text:Kibbe System and Body Inclusivity	labels:I didn’t find it particularly inclusive. I took the test and got theatric romantic, but then I have some features listed in the “Will NOT” section??   I think it makes some assumptions as to what type of body type goes with what type of face that just didn’t hold true for my square-shaped face with large features and petite, muscular pear-shaped frame.
text:Yes! I’ve been feeling the same way you described in your second paragraph, but I didn’t know how to put it into words!

text:How much was your most expensive fashion item and when or how often do you wear it?	labels:My most expensive items have all been high quality copies of items I have in low quality but wore out the wazoo.  For example, I knew I was ready to invest in some high end Chelsea boots when I found myself going through a cheap pair every year. Or to invest in a nice leather-looking jacket when I found myself grabbing mine 70% of the time I went out.  The expensive items were hard to wear at first, maybe on date nights or to a nicer event, but as I got more used to wearing them I wore them more often. I think it took me a hot year before I wore my Red Wings more than like once a month.   My recommendation is keep the items in your comfort zone (so no wild dresses or Colors at first) and to force yourself to wear it at a regular interval. These days, just wearing nice jeans while I go shopping seems to be my “date night” when I dress up!

text:How much was your most expensive fashion item and when or how often do you wear it?	labels:My most expensive items are my Native American Turquoise jewelry and my cowboy boots. Just purchased a huge $900 squash blossom necklace and have worn it constantly. My boots range from $30 for a secondhand pair to $750 for custom made and none are worn more or less than the others.  When my mother passed, she was 88. I went to clean out her closet and drawers and found so many lovely things that were carefully boxed away or wrapped in tissue that she was “saving for good”. Ironically, “good” apparently never came as these things went unused.  I decided right then to never do that. Every day is special and I am worth taking the time to look and feel special even if I’m just out running errands.
text:Were you able to make use of any of your mother's special items that were packed away and never used?	labels:While her things had so much sentimental value for me, our styles were vastly different so I can’t say that any of it was of use to me other than the mink jacket that my father gave her for their 30th wedding anniversary ( and she wore only twice because she was “saving it for good”). I’ve kept it to be restyled into a fur vest as I have a fake one that I wear constantly, so I know I’ll use it.	episode_done:True

My Alexa is 10 years old and seems to look nicer with wear. I did treat the leather so that I could take into it in rain, but I’m not particularly nice to it (things have spilled in it, and I’ve overstuffed it more times than I can count...). It’s a perfectly sized cross body bag (translation: fits tons of stuff and frees up your hands so you can do all the things!).  The Bayswater is my work bag. I can fit my laptop in this, along with my walled on a chain (so no changing bags!). It’s structured, so it looks polished and professional.

It's split into two sides with several small pockets. Holds a water bottle, my iPad, fidget toys, phone wallet keys or and some reusable grocery bags with room to spare. Could hold a laptop. This is the bag things can get lost in. I could use it for an overnight trip if I really needed to. It's the biggest purse I've owned in a long time, but I'm really loving it.   A mini backpack for bike riding days or hiking with friends. Has a mesh pocket inside and can hold phone wallet keys a sandwich and headphones. Athletic type material. I have this in black, beige and fuschia.   A canvas satchel/messenger bag for doctor's office type visits where I'll have to wait or errands that need less stuff brought along. Has a few compartments and can fit my iPad, kindle or an 8x5 book with phone wallet keys, lotion, probably some makeup if needed. I have this in brown, purple and charcoal because it's such a good bag.   A small black pleather half-moon crossbody with gold accents for quick stuff like the gas station, taking a walk or some type of event where I have to look nice.

Very simple way to add a touch of something to an outfit. They also travel easily as they essentially pack flat, so you can bring several and use them to change up your simple travel outfits.   But if I'm shopping or doing something where I need to be hands-free, then it's a cross body. I have a few of these but my most often used is the Lo&Sons Waverly. I do like this brand and also have their laptop bag with the interchangeable sleeves. I just noticed they have a new fanny pack style... hmmmmm... gotta check that out! My other favorite cross body, which is a bit more spacious and dressier and can act as a satchel, I think is a Coach but you wouldn't know it (I hate obvious branding).  If I need room for more stuff then I've got a choice between a white leather backpack and a black leather backpack.   I don't really like totes, shoulder bags, or satchels any more. There was a time when I had a lot of those, but these days I prefer a bag that's smaller and not too heavy to carry. Got tired of having shoulder pain or wrist pain, but I'm a grumpy old middle aged woman. Rock it while you can.	episode_done:True
text:What’s your everyday purse?	labels:I have the Cuyana oversized carryall tote and it's excellent.   For a smaller bag I kinds of hate what I have right now so I'm planning to buy the Cuyana mini circle belt bag for when I just need a few small items to go out.	episode_done:True

They’re kinda terrible for lounging in so I never find myself reaching for them anymore, and that makes me sad. I never thought I would say this, but I’m tired of wearing leggings 24/7. I was firmly in camp “leggings are pants” back in the day, but I’ll be happy to go back to only wearing them on the weekends.   I know I could go ahead and wear denim if I wanted, but it feels pointless changing into jeans just to drive to the post office or grocery pickup.   I don’t really miss dressy outfits, since those occasions were rare to begin with, so I’m used to “waiting” for a reason to dress up. But I do miss my less-comfy casual outfits.	episode_done:True

text:Share the outfits you would wear if the world was normal!	labels:I already have my christmas outfit planned out, I want to dress up so bad. I'm liking green, red, yellow and glitter recently, and I want to wear a flowery green top with a short brown pencil leather skirt, tights and black leather Vagabond Dioon shoes (or perhaps some studded black cowboy ankle boots with a sharp tip for some drama would be nice, just have to buy those first). I already have the outfit, but I'm on a weight loss journey (steady throughout the past two months, 5 lbs left to lose) and I need to lose 3 lbs for the skirt not to look awkward with my slight tummy bulge when I'm eating huge meals.  I do, however, wear a lot of interesting clothes just for when I'm out shopping or even having to go to the doctor. I'm doing a lot of experimentation with style now that no people of any importance to me whatsoever are gonna see me, and I can try out shoes with different heels and clothes with different fit, wear it throughout the day, and then know if it works for my lifestyle or not. I realized that a glitter top is see-through in some kinds of lighting, and that the cleavage on my wrap top is getting looser throughout the day, revealing more than I would like, etc. Also buying heel buffers for shoes I have never worn because they give me blisters, and wearing new leather shoes around the house to break them in, etc.	episode_done:True

text:Has consulting a stylist really been a revelation to you?	labels:I had a workshop with a stylist a few years ago. It was really helpful. She taught us about warm and cold colors, about clothes that fit our body types, about different styles and we had this test with warm- and cold-colored fabrics where she told us which colors suited us best. I tried to stick to cold colors (which suit me best) for a while, but then I got bored, and now I wear warm as well.	episode_done:True
text:Has consulting a stylist really been a revelation to you?	labels:A few years ago i was feeling badly about myself following the end of a 4 year relationship. I decided to find a local personal shopper to go through my closet and help me decide what to keep/donate. She also provided me with ways to wear what i already had. From that, she created a list of things she thought i would need to add to my wardrobe according to my lifestyle and wants/needs. We then went to the mall a few days later and she brought in tons of things to try. The rule was that i had to show her everything, but i had the final say as to what i wanted to get. This was great because it also provided me with an opportunity to get more styling tips on items i don’t currently own but might consider moving forward.  Since then, i have felt so much more confident in how i dress and i constantly receive tons on compliments. I would 10/10 recommend this to anyone who wants to change their style or learn more about what looks best on them. I figured the $400 i spent on her was equivalent to how much money I’d spend on items i would never actually wear, and in the long run became an investment :).
text:That sounds like so much fun! I want to do this because I have moments of feeling myself and others where comfort is queen and screw looking good. But deep down inside I just want to present my best self no matter what situation I'm in!	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Has consulting a stylist really been a revelation to you?	labels:Yes! I’d been indoctrinated to think of blush, nude, and light gray as wonderful colors that elevate everybody’s look but I never felt my best in these clothes I kept buying. Then I consulted a stylist and did more color analysis online myself and learned that NONE of these colors work on me. I felt so relieved. I was also relieved to be told my figure is suited for medium to high rise pants. So it wasn’t my fault that I didn’t feel my best all those years low rise jeans were all the rage. How old are you?

text:Has consulting a stylist really been a revelation to you?	labels:I love my stylist. I was stuck in a terrible fashion rut.

text:Has consulting a stylist really been a revelation to you?	labels:I did a consultation recently and a stylist wasn't for me.   I have a particular style that I wanted and she just styled me for general stuff. She was good but I realized I could do the leg work myself since she was buying mostly online.  I just mentally made it a project for myself, told myself there was no budget constraint and it has been working amazingly! I just had to put it in a different perspective. I realized I had a lot of shopping anxiety because of the parameters I put on myself such as clothing has to be on sale. I also have a lot of down time at work to get the project done.  I went from having too few clothing, those which I was very meh to a lot of clothes I can mix and match and love! It's taken me like 2 months but I'm like 80% done. Taking a little longer than I want because Covid is causing lag time. People at work have definitely notice (I work an essential, non public job).  I'm spending a lot less money than budgeted for the stylist to do a wardrobe overhaul. Ive been wanting to do this for many years. My husband and I budgeted $5k to $8k for the stylist and wardrobe. So far I have only spent less than $3k. I'm estimating ill spend $3.5k when I'm done.	episode_done:True
text:What are your most loved ride-or-die winter clothing items?	labels:A parka I got from Target last year. It wasn't even $50, and it's the *warmest* jacket I've ever had in my life. I live in the northeast, where the snow and wind can be brutal, and I was used to spending upwards of $150 on coats that didn't even do anything.  I'm in the process of losing weight, so I figured spending $50 on a winter coat I would wear for maybe two seasons wasn't bad at all.

text:What are your most loved ride-or-die winter clothing items?	labels:How fun to hear how different places make such a difference in what you need for winter! Great question, as we are having snow as we speak! Winter here (inter mountain west US) lasts til April when we might see the ground again, so warm, wind proof and dry are key attributes for clothing for keeping you alive and well. We like Sorel boots with the heavy felt liners for below zero outdoor activities. But since they’re lighter LLBean insulated boots for snowshoeing and general wear around town . Inside the house  the warmest footwear is Hafflinger felt clogs. Socks we use heavy wool blend Darn Tough. All of these items last a long time so worth the money. Since we’re both retired we don’t have to gussy up much so I only need one or two warm  long skirts for church. He likes Duluth work jeans and plaid flannel shirts and always a ball cap on his head. I have a couple of fleece jackets (Columbia) and 2 Orvis cashmere sweaters that were on sale 2 years ago. For me under the sweaters I like 3/4 or short sleeve t-shirts . Neither of us likes turtle neck shirts. Our outdoor coats are: his Columbia and mine Jack Wolfskin both with integrated hood. A surprisingly warm kind of gloves is Kinko work gloves. They come in mittens as well as regular gloves, but need to be waterproofed before shoveling snow. They are very reasonable in price and sturdy. If it’s below zero and blowing out a nice wool scarf to protect your face. We don’t need snow pants or long underwear for our daily walks, but probably would for snowshoeing.

text:Shinies From the Past - or, What to do with Gifts from Past Relationships?	labels:Depends on what it is. Engagement ring? Probably not gonna be able to wear that, might as well sell it or have it reset into a different piece.   One of my exes is the son of a jeweler and I got some extremely nice pieces in the 5 years we were together. There is no way I would have parted with any of it (unlikely to buy pieces at this price point for myself) but I did return the engagement ring since it was his mother's diamond. Everything else is still in rotation.
text:That's very interesting! One of the pieces I'm struggling with is, in fact, a ring, although not an engagement ring. Did you find you had a hard time detaching the relationship from the pieces you did keep, or not so much?	labels:I didn’t ever really feel weird about it because it was all stuff I really really liked. I did get rid of the one piece I wasn’t thrilled about (a watch, I don’t wear them and he didn’t listen - shockingly part of why we’re not together!) but kept the ones that I could see myself wearing. It took me a bit to wear any of it after the breakup but I told myself the relationship was what sucked, not the jewelry. 😂
text:Ha, I love it! I really like 2 pieces in particular but think it's gonna take a bit to wear it, as you say. I never really wear a lot of jewellery, especially now that we can't go anywhere, so it still feels very connected to those few times I did wear them which of course was with the ex lol.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Shinies From the Past - or, What to do with Gifts from Past Relationships?	labels:Your wounds may still be fresh; even if it was a mutual breakup there are lingering emotions.   This is a different take, but why not put it in storage for a little while until you can heal?  If you really like the jewelry in an aesthetic sense there is no reason to get rid of it. When my first real boyfriend and I broke up (mutual but messy) I put some gifts he gave me in my memory box and didn't touch it for years. More than enough time has passed for those emotions to mellow and now I can look at those memories as something sweet and valuable in my past without any romantic connotations.
text:I actually have moved on quite fully, and am happily involved in a new relationship but do like that idea of putting it away for a while to see if it helps with the detachment! There are two pieces that I do really love, but didn't wear frequently and so now feels a little weird to wear around my new partner. I've had the pieces put away for a while already, so may just continue to leave them until more time has passed!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Shinies From the Past - or, What to do with Gifts from Past Relationships?	labels:I've only ever had one person give really nice jewelry. (Not that I've gotten a lot of jewelry in general, but like, as a teenager, I was given a necklace from like Sears or something. Meaningful at the time, but not something I'd save anyway probably...) The relationship ended terribly but I liked the piece. I just had it remade. Any good jeweler can do this pretty easily (not always cheaply, though). I turned one necklace into two. The jeweler worked with me, as I came in eith general, vague ideas and they actually drew up plans and designs, which I picked from...It was cathartic in a way. I wore one of the necklaces to renew a restraining order against the guy and it felt like an ultimate "screw you, I have the power here" move lol	episode_done:True
text:Shinies From the Past - or, What to do with Gifts from Past Relationships?	labels:Haha I definitely run into this same issue! I tend to associate items really strongly with the context in which I got them, and personally feel weird reselling gifts, so donations or trash bin it is for me.   I usually donate jewelry (depending on the piece) to organizations that specifically help people with interview/business-wear or prom outfits. I’ve also donated gifted jewelry or suitcases to women’s shelters before.
text:I feel that! I agree, I like the idea of donating to someone who wouldn't otherwise have pieces like that. I think my main concern with donating is that it runs the risk of just being resold anyways at a thrift store, and likely not for what the item is worth.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Shinies From the Past - or, What to do with Gifts from Past Relationships?	labels:I just went through this - I held on to two beautiful gold Tiffany necklaces and a diamond solitaire bracelet from an ex of 6 years. I loved them but no matter how hard I tried I couldn't wear them and not think of that relationship (which didn't end on awful terms, I had just moved on). I sold them all recently on Poshmark.  It kind of stings and feels bittersweet because they were beautiful, but I used the money to invest in something new, to me from me. Now I can wear it without any weird memory strings attached. Feels kind of freeing honestly!	episode_done:True
text:Shinies From the Past - or, What to do with Gifts from Past Relationships?	labels:My taste in jewellery has evolved over the years, and most boyfriend jewellery was small silver things, so I’ve either donated them to op shops, or passed them on to other people.   I had one little diamond ring that he paid about $200 for, and I sold that to a pawn broker for about $80. Then I probably spent the money on clothes and wine.	episode_done:True

I hate the return of the Mean Girls/bitchy rich white girl/fucking velour Juicy tracksuit look. Probably because I started high school in 2001 and it was like the hey day of bland tackiness and Paris Hilton and I'm too close to it, lived it a little too much, to find any novelty in it. SO vapid. I was slightly vapid and a little mean for a while around that time before I came into myself and I don't like the reminders.  What I do like about the looks above though, is that I see the 60s and 90s Spice Girls influences and I can get into that.  Edit: also, on occasion, I wear low rise pants, but I like looking at trends for inspiration and new ideas, not dictating what I can or can't wear. If you like low rise jeans and hipster minis, rock em. If not, fuck em forever, who cares.
text:The tackiness of it is a FINE LINE. Your point about seeing 60s and 90s influence in this looks is important. I  love 60s and 70s fashion. I feel some of it was a bit mix matchy and almost tacky but way more sleek that early 2000s. I've been buying vintage 60s and 70s stuff and love it. I want bell sleeves and groovy patterns to have a bigger comeback than 2000s stuff.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:This so much. Especially when I've been browsing for way too long, I can get a tunnel view of "just adding this, and oh this is also nice". Bookmarking and then leaving things for a day or two really helps against impulse buys.  I also have a list of things that I feel are missing (eg. in winter I notice again and again that I don't have a warm scarf that works with several of my outfits -> specific colored scarf goes onto the list). With that I can still enjoy browsing for new stuff, but I know I'm actually closing gaps in my wardrobe when I buy things, not just amass new stuff (which of course can also be fun...)	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Crazy theory here - but has anyone noticed that sometimes stores say the item is now sold out? I’ve done this a few times only to come back and the item is gone. But when I sign out it magically is there. I feel like there are a few retailers that use this as a tactic to not “wait too long.”	labels:The "almost gone! Only two left but three people have it in their cart! Sale ends in 01:03:29" types of messages are in fact just marketing. They're designed to create a sense of urgency and fear of missing out, which then triggers the impulse to buy without further evaluation.   Remember how you used to see furniture stores with "going out of business" sales that never seemed to actually go out of business? It's the same thing: people think they have a limited time to take advantage of a "deal" that might never return and are more likely to buy. That particular problem was so pervasive that U.S. law changed to ban that as a bait and switch/false advertising scam.  There are tons of ways that businesses use psychology to entice consumers. Everything from the color of the walls to the height of a shelf is done with a specific purpose. Same thing applies to websites.

text:Quick tips to look UN-polished?	labels:I hope you're not asking this because of rude comments from others - if so, it's worth learning to ignore those people.  That said, I've found lightening up the hairstyling and makeup is quite helpful if you want to look more relaxed.  I also have a personal rule about shoes and skirts: the higher the hemline, the less sexy the shoe. This keeps miniskirts looking relaxed, and prevents longer skirts from skewing frumpy. Obviously rules are meant to be broken, including this one, and it doesn't really apply in the evening.

text:Quick tips to look UN-polished?	labels:The key is actually just learning how to create FABULOUS casual outfits rather than tryin to dull down a dressy outfit. Instead of starting from a place of Dressiness, start with Casual then work on making it the NICEST version of casual possible.    I like to wear jeans and loafers and then some gold earrings, a small scarf, a blazer and maybe a necklace. Where I live even that can be too fancy. So if I see its over the top, I just whip off the scarf and blazer, wipe the lipstick off a little and then I'm looking really cute casual in a t-shirt and jeans.     Overly styled hair and makeup is one thing I notice older women do that "ruins" a casual outfit. The hair is often too stiff and done and the makeup too "nice". So I think having a really pretty, casual go-to hair and makeup routine is important.	episode_done:True
text:Quick tips to look UN-polished?	labels:Was doing long distance for a long while and had a ton of "date dresses" (think body-con dresses, LBDs) that really don't really work day to day on their own. Eventually I got sick of them gathering dust so I'd wear them to class with thick long cardigans, and bright coloured tights or slouchy socks/boots. I also sometimes wear dresses as "skirts" by pulling a hoodie or crewneck over it.  I love blazers but like to wear them casually too. So I sometimes wear my fav blazer with jeans/leggings and a concert T to go run errands. Sometimes I top it with a wide-brimmed felt hat.	episode_done:True
text:Quick tips to look UN-polished?	labels:I like to add a casual element: sneakers, loafers, oxfords,  jean jacket, moto jacket, hoodie, or chunky cardigan. Shape matters as well, pairing a looser element to the outfit reads as more casual in most cases.  Depending on the jewelry - big jewelry or stones tend to look casual.	episode_done:True
text:Quick tips to look UN-polished?	labels:My boyfriend tells me not to do this, his words are "fuck them. They don't matter. Dress how you want to" The one thing I'm massively insecure about is over dressing. I've been singled out for this a lot and it's frusting. I just want to look good. I'm not wearing inappropriate for the situation clothes either. It's more like I'm the only one in heels to dinner because I like them. And dinner like a nice place with drinks after not an ihop to a pool hall. The most picked at are a couple form fitting casual tshirt dresses I have. I love them them with some boots in the fall. But my casual clothes are not casual enough for everyone else? and they have to make comments about it. I get so anxious about it now I just sit naked on the floor for like 30 minutes staring at the few clothes I have left while my boyfriend checks in on me to see how my progress is going so we can leave finally.   But when it's just me and him going somewhere there's no problem at all. I'll wear anything confidently and feel great about it. But make me go to some kind of party or events where I know people and I just freak out and cry.   I want to look awesome. My boyfriend wants me to look awesome. Why are we trying to tone down our awesome because of how people want to be buttholes and judge us? For looking good. How are you going to let someone shame you for something you aren't ashamed of? Doesn't mean much comming from a girl who panics about going to dinner with friends but I try to remind myself of this all the time. I shouldn't have to dress down because it makes other people feel uncomfortable.

text:This sounds crazyyyy! Not you, but people who comment negatively on you looking nice!? Now that you mentioned it, I remember that someone in my social circle does this. “That’s a really fancy dress. Are you going anywhere else after here?” Or “That’s awfully nice looking for just a game night”. I usually respond to her with “Yeah, I like dressing up”. Having a thick skin helps.	labels:It's wild because I have a pretty thick skin, like I've tackled felons and taken them to jail all while they trash talk me trying to get me riled up. But something about being criticized for looking good really messes me up.   I've had a lot of really negative experiences with it. I don't see any of those people anymore but I've heard women talk about other women so much I know I'm being talked about too. And I'm basically friendless now so I've been actively trying to get new friends. I feel like I can't look too good or I'll just be judged as a snobby attention seeking homewrecker and no one will want to be friends with me. And I body build so I've got a less common shape that gets talked about too. I love my body and I'm so proud of it but I don't feel comfortable around people. Everyone just looks at me. I've had people move tables entirely when I've sat down. I end up going alone to a lot of conferences and events and that's a hard blow when I'm just trying to be friendly and I can't fit in.	episode_done:True

text:What do you guys think about sites like Poshmark and Curtsey?	labels:I almost solely buy clothing from Poshmark, ThredUP and Depop. I like giving clothes a second life, and a lot of the time, when I find an item I like, the seller has more things so I bundle, save money, and I’m able to ship it all at once. I haven’t had many bad experiences with online secondhand sites and I’ve used them for 6 years now.
text:Yep, I'd say 90% of my stuff is from Poshmark now. I only buy from brands Im familiar with so I know the sizing.  But it has saved me so much money and most of the time the stuff is like new.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What do you guys think about sites like Poshmark and Curtsey?	labels:So far, my experience with Poshmark has been good.  I have been able to sell some of my clothes that I no longer wanted and at the same time, I've bought a few nice pieces.  Right now I'm wearing a v-neck Merino wool sweater that I got from Poshmark.	episode_done:True
text:What do you guys think about sites like Poshmark and Curtsey?	labels:I buy 90% of my clothes from Poshmark and ThredUp.    Poshmark: has a much larger inventory than ThredUp.  You can communicate with sellers and can often bundle items for discounts and ask for more pictures/measurements.  ThredUp: easier to search for a type of item (e.g. white cotton t-shirt) and save that search, which I find really helpful.  Much easier to find a specific fabric.  For example I love linen and there's no way to find linen clothes on Poshmark besides just searching "linen" and hoping the seller looked at the fabric.  Each item is shown on a mannequin, which is nice but sometimes it's difficult to see the details (hem, pattern, etc.).	episode_done:True
text:What do you guys think about sites like Poshmark and Curtsey?	labels:I buy from The RealReal and sometimes Poshmark.   Poshmark has really good prices on some items, especially if I'm looking for something specific and not high-end, like a certain Express top I read about. (Ebay can be useful for this, too.) Prices on higher-end stuff aren't competitive IME, but I haven't looked for much in that range. Also be aware the shipping cost per item will add a good chunk to a cheap piece.  Prices on The RealReal are not cheap, but if you hang out a while you get a sense of what's decent, and sometimes you find something really neat for good deal. The best feature of TRR is measurements, something that's ruined me for other sites at that price point. It helps to be familiar with your own measurements and take into account materials and the shape of your body--I'm short, for example, so measurements are all well and good, but if my hips hit at the waist they don't mean much.   Caveats there: Be attentive to whether or not something is returnable; it's published on each listing. Bags usually aren't, as well as anything whose price has been marked down a lot. Also, shipping costs are $12 each way, so I eat the cost and buy several items in the same order, knowing I'll return half of them if they don't fit right. Shopping there successfully is a bit of a learning process, but I've really liked it overall.	episode_done:True
text:What do you guys think about sites like Poshmark and Curtsey?	labels:I like Poshmark. They have a good selection of stuff and you can communicate with the seller. However I would definitely stick with The RealReal or Vestiaire Collective for higher end items since they authenticate everything. Every time I see used designer on Poshmark I’m always worried it’s fake	episode_done:True
text:What do you guys think about sites like Poshmark and Curtsey?	labels:Love poshmark! I got really nice clothes (like a cashmere sweater) for a very good price. If your style veers towards what's on style at the moment, you'll have a harder time finding it/pay a good price. But mine veers towards simple/trendless/hint of vintage-y things so it's perfect for me.	episode_done:True
text:What do you guys think about sites like Poshmark and Curtsey?	labels:Poshmark and ebay tend to be my first stops when I'm looking for a specific item.  (People go through things so quickly these days that pre-covid I'd often try on something at a store and find it barely worn on poshmark in my size while I was still in the fitting room.)  I find them much easier to narrow things down to exactly what I want than other sites.    If I have a general idea of what I'm looking for but I'm not looking for a specific item, I also like thredup.  I haven't used curtsey enough to have a real opinion on it, as I prefer desktop but I don't like their website.
text:This might be a stupid question but I’ve never used eBay to buy clothes. Is there a certain way to do it? Lol I stopped using eBay years ago when I kept getting ripped off 🙄	labels:Personally I only use ebay when I'm looking for something really specific, usually either an exact item that I know my size in or a specific type of vintage item.  That makes the search function much easier to use.  (You can also set alerts to tell you when something that fits your parameters is posted.)    Check measurements, look at the photos carefully (and make sure they're the seller's photos, not stock photos, with the possible exception of new overstock items), and read the condition description.  Ask questions if you need to.  I don't order anything without measurements unless it's a contemporary item and I already know my size in it.    In terms of getting ripped off, check the seller's feedback.  You want both positive feedback and a lot of feedback.  But ebay's changed a lot since the early days.  I've never not gotten what I thought I was getting.

text:What do you guys think about sites like Poshmark and Curtsey?	labels:For the most part, Poshmark is pretty reliable and the sellers give reasonable discounts and deals for their items. However, when it comes to Depop I would stay away. I’ve caught multiple sellers listing items for triple the price and scamming individuals. It’s honestly hit or miss with these types of sites.

text:What Did You Recently Get Rid of From Your Closet (and How, Please Help Me Help Myself)	labels:I once got the tip to put everything in your closet with the open part of your hanger hook facing out. Then, when you wear something, turn that hanger the right side out (i.e. round side of the hook facing out). Set a time period that you want to revisit cleaning your closet (i.e. a season/year etc) and after that time period donate or throw out everything that still has the hook turned in. Similarly, pack all the things you aren't sure if you want to keep into a box and set a time frame. If you find yourself wanting to wear something in that box, take it out. At the end of the time-frame, donate what's still there (especially if you forgot that item existed).  Recently due to COVID, I moved across back the country so I had to fit my closet into suitcases. That involved donating a lot of things that are perfectly nice and wearable but what I had to admit to myself that 1)I actually never wore in the 3 years I lived there and 2) didn't miss in the few months that I was living without them (I was living out of a carry on when I got unexpectedly stuck back home).  In terms of the never throw anything out, perhaps donate it to  a charity that's helps dress the less fortunate for work? They're definitely pieces that others will love.

text:Yep, this. I used to hesitate to donate "perfectly good" clothes (ones that weren't ill-fitted, out of fashion, or ill-suited for my lifestyle) because I was so afraid I'd regret it - like one day I'd find the "perfect outfit combination" for that item.   I've learned that 99% of the time, you won't even remember what you donated after a few weeks. But also... yeah, there are a few items I regret giving away. It happens, and it's okay: you'll have a day or two of "ah damn, I should have kept that", and then you move on. It's better to just make the decision to donate and feel less anxious about your wardrobe size overall.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:What Did You Recently Get Rid of From Your Closet (and How, Please Help Me Help Myself)	labels:Konmari only worked a little for me, as I find joy having clothes to meet any occasion including weight going up or down. Also clothes are more like a hobby and also sentimental so doing them first never made sense to me.   What's worked best over the years is more of a "container" strategy. Let's take your socks for an example. I allot only so much room for socks in one section of a drawer. Those socks with holes are going right out, I don't have room for them and I'm not making room for holey socks. I would take the cue that these socks were so well loved they got holes, so I am fine with finding a similar replacement, then tossing the holey socks to make room for a similar pair I know I'm going to love and wear a lot.   Work stuff and COVID is so much more difficult. Pre-COVID I traveled a lot for work so needed to pretty much maintain a 4-season all weather occasion work wardrobe for all cultural possibilities and their nuances. That's long been 80% of my wardrobe.   But now here we are. And everything's been turned on its head, and that 80% wardrobe is just gathering dust, while the 20% is getting worn 80% of the time. Who am I kidding... more like 100% of the time!  But I'm not ready to declutter my work wear because when we have a vaccine and we're back to normal work schedules, it would be too costly to replace all of it. Especially if somewhere along the line I was laid off.  So for now I've basically SCRUNCHED all my work wardrobe into the smallest possible footprint to make more room for the stuff I'm actually wearing. And re-shuffled so the stuff I'm actually wearing is front and center and the other items are harder to access.   The cool thing is WFH means you can do laundry more often, so no, you do not need a month's worth of loungewear, tees, leggings. You just don't.	episode_done:True

text:What Did You Recently Get Rid of From Your Closet (and How, Please Help Me Help Myself)	labels:The last time I did a big closet cleanse, I made a list of reminders in BIG sharpie letters that I hung on my mirror in front of where my face would be. So, instead of looking at myself and judging myself and fantasizing about who I could be in those clothes... I saw my list and the clothes below it. It made things much easier from an emotional standpoint.  My list went something like this:  * You can only wear one pair of pants at a time. (Which applies to all garments but I like the groundedness of pants as the representative of all clothes.)  * You are a stylish and fashionable person no matter what you wear.  * You would rather have the money.  * You enjoy spending time on maintenance, but that does not include organizing your storage!  If I did this exercise again today, I would also include:  * If you don't want to wear it right now, you probably will never want to wear it. (Speaking to emotional reaction to clothes, not situational factors like working from home, etc.)  * If you don't want to mend it or alter it, that might be because you don't actually want to wear it.	episode_done:True

But it was time to face the facts that even though its cute on the hanger, doesn’t mean it’ll flatter me. I also got rid of this shirt that was tailored pretty poorly in my opinion. It looked so boxy in the worst way. An easy throw away if you ask me.	episode_done:True
text:Are your glasses part of your style?	labels:My glasses are too expensive these days to be a part of my style. They are more a part of “me.” I don’t mind checking out cheap frames but my damn 1.74 high index lenses and their coatings =|	episode_done:True
text:Are your glasses part of your style?	labels:I think those would look really cute! I've always admired people's glasses. I actually made a big jump last year. I always had dark rectangular glasses, because I thought I needed them to balance out my "round face". But I fell in love with tortoise glasses, they looked so soft and pretty. I bought a pair and I haven't been happier!  I do see my glasses as being part of my appearance in a more permanent way, like my hair. I think as I've gotten older, I feel less angst about what I like and how I look.	episode_done:True
text:Are your glasses part of your style?	labels:Glasses are a permanent fixture for me. I try to go with something that fits my shape and then find a nice style. I've had the same tortishell pair for about 4+ years now (the longest I've owned the same style) and I love them! they're neutral so they go with pretty much everything. then again my wardrobe is pretty neutral, as well haha	episode_done:True
text:Are your glasses part of your style?	labels:My glasses are a very permanent part of my look -- more part of my body, really. I see myself in the mirror in those glasses no matter what style I'm wearing. I definitely stick to what I finally discovered works on me because glasses are expensive and complicated for me and I don't want to be stuck with something that's popular right now but doesn't suit me.
text:Yup. For the longest time I had black frames because they go with anything. Once I worked at an optical shop I got to play around a bit and try on different frame styles. Also got some tips given my prescription and face shape. I had 3 pairs that I rotated with, 2 round and one squarish-round (?) for a more professional look. And none of them were black. It was also the time I got the most compliments regarding my frames.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Are your glasses part of your style?	labels:I typically wear contacts, and glasses when my eyes need a break. As you can surmise, the pandemic means a lot more glasses time. A couple of years ago I thought about how my glasses were much more boring than my outfits. So I started to mix in more fun and colorful frames. It also helped that my eyes have hardly changed over the last few years. So I started getting fun colors. I had a brown pair with neon trim as the first "weird" pair. Then a wood grain, which was the neutral, then a bright blue pair, and later yellow metal frames. Now a pink and black pair is leading....I can't seem to find the yellow! I am not sure what I'll get for this year.   Anyway for me, I realized I needed statement glasses to go with my love of pattern! I still mostly stick to solids and either cat eye or narrow rectangle shapes, but I find attention attracting glasses are a nice exclamation point on an outfit.	episode_done:True

text:Are your glasses part of your style?	labels:I have at least 20 frames.  Some of them are no longer my prescription but I don’t want to get rid of them. I buy them from zenni but also wherelight and some other places. They are most definitely an accessory because sometimes I need them to stand out more or less depending on my outfit.   My eye doctor has me wearing progressive lenses now so the price has gone up significantly on my everyday glasses so I don’t have the same selection I used to. However, I can see just as well out of my $60 zennis as I can out of my $400 frames from the eye doctor.	episode_done:True
text:Are your glasses part of your style?	labels:Yes, absolutely. My glasses are an important part of my style because I have to wear them all day every day. I only have one pair, they suit me really well and they're very much part of my look~	episode_done:True
text:Are your glasses part of your style?	labels:I haven't been able to buy any glasses online yet. Glasses feel like too much of a serious purchase to leave in my amateur hands. Also, if I already overthink which earrings to wear to work everyday, imagine if I had to pick out glasses too??? That being said, I wear the same glasses everyday for 2-3 years until I can't stand the sight of them and then go buy something totally different, then repeat. I try out different shapes and styles (I've had square hipster, cat's eye, tortoiseshell, thick arms, and currently big nearly-clear peachy ones which are my favourite because they show off my eye makeup and are less in-your-face. What I refuse to wear are colourful glasses, because I know I'll get sick of those quirky red frames super quickly!) People get so freaked out when I show up to work with a different hairstyle...can you imagine how many irritating comments I'd have to deal with if I switched up my glasses every day? "Something's different about you today..." "Did you get new glasses?" Etc. For my own personal sanity, I could never!   Anyway, if you're feeling in the mood for a switch up, I say go for it! These are something you wear everyday so you should love them!	episode_done:True
text:Are your glasses part of your style?	labels:I’ve got the basic frames that I wear most days, one black and one light colored pair. and a few fun/brightly colored once that I wear when they match my outfit etc zenni is so much cheaper than going to my regular eye dr that I’ve got 7 pairs now. Love being able to change it up	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else hate literally everything they put on?	labels:What i wear in my private life i know suits me and even if it doesn't flatter me according to fashion "rules", it makes me feel invincible and powerful.  What i wear to work is just temporary cloth to cover my body.  I have basically no emotional attachment to any of it, and i know it is actively unflattering.  However, showing up at my science job in full goth/pagan gear would be....frowned upon.  So i have 2 separate wardrobes and rarely shall the twain meet.  I don't love the situation, but it's the reality of life, so i endure.	episode_done:True

text:Does anyone else hate literally everything they put on?	labels:Yes....basically because I have no idea what my styler is currently. My daughter says boho, and I see that to some extent but I kind of prefer leggings, just leggings all around.  I used to always dress up and now I’m like blahhhh...don’t care. These shorts are riding up my arse- don’t care.  You said camel toe is at full attention - still don’t care.  I feel like a slob but thankfully trying to find my old self .... that old me that wore heals.  Fancy	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else hate literally everything they put on?	labels:I think my main issue is that there are a lot of skinny girls or beautiful curvy girls and I’ve got a more athletic straight up and down build and idk everyone is insecure to an extent but why do they all “look so model like” and then there’s me? Idk I love clothes and I love styling my outfits but sometimes it gets me like fuck my waist isn’t small enough or my arms aren’t dainty or some stupid shit like that🤷🏾‍♀️😂	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else hate literally everything they put on?	labels:100%. Sometimes I'm okay with it at first but soon after, absolutely hate it. Nothing fits right. Nothing looks right. I havebt tested this theory out, yet but Ive come to the conclusion its two things. 1. Im wearing clothes that are cute but not my style. And 2. Theyre not tailored.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else hate literally everything they put on?	labels:Yeah, I do have this too - clothing somehow looks way better on other people! I guess it is in my head although there is also probably a grain of truth to dressing for your shape and wearing clothes that are mostly or all in good condition etc	episode_done:True

text:Difficulty distinguishing between so 'idealized' style and personal style?	labels:Right now, a lot of people's best intentions are devolving into "old lounge wear" because we haven't anywhere to go. Or when we have, it's running errands. Australia just got out of lockdown, I know Germany is going back in partially, the UK's going back in... and America is still a chaotic mess, but a lot of people are still working from home. So part of the answer may be "wait unti the world is different for you".
text:Seconding this. After years of experimenting, I’ve finally landed on a style that feels right to me and have a curated closet full of beautiful things I love, but I’m not wearing any of that right now. I mostly wear sweats and pajamas because I can’t bring myself to slip into a fabulous dress to bake bread or scrub my bathroom .... which are the sort of things I get dressed for right now.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Difficulty distinguishing between so 'idealized' style and personal style?	labels:I moved back home earlier this year and as a result had a much reduced storage situation. I sorted my clothes into three categories,wear,don’t wear often (or at all) and doesn’t fit.  I donated the truly ill fitting items and my sister picked out some items she liked.  The last category I put in a drawer and wore each one throughout a month and noted what I was drawn to and what I liked especially the items I had purchased for ‘fantasy me’.   Mixing them with familiar clothing helped make them more accessible and actually a usable part of my wardrobe.   Essentially I now feel like I have a new wardrobe. Plus the notes I made meant I know what I actually like to wear more and therefore purchase in the future and what should definitely stay a fantasy item that I only like on IG or something.	episode_done:True
text:Difficulty distinguishing between so 'idealized' style and personal style?	labels:I slipped into the "easy casual lounge wear" early on in the shut down where I live. I almost immediately left crappy and sad. I realized for me, in a world where I have no control over anything, I do have control over what I wear. Even though I have been working from home, and have no where to go, I get dressed...every day.   After a while I realized that, no one sees me except maybe a waist up video call once a day, so why not wear things that I was excited about? Who cares if anyone else likes it. I have always been drawn to vintage pieces and even had a few in my closet. I rarely wore them because they didn't fit the classic business casual that was expected in my office. I wore those pieces almost every day. Then I started a Pinterest board with really specific criteria, earth tones (looks good with my skin tone), vintage cuts, texture, natural fibers. Boom. For the first time in my 30yrs I had a style that I loved!   I kept the few items I already had and loved, and slowly started collecting others that would match or compliment them. I went the thrifting route because 1. its cheaper, and 2. I could find good quality pieces in natural fibers more easily than if I had gone to the mall. I would visit a thrift store once every two weeks and get one or two items, always reminding myself of my criteria (natural fibres, classic/vintage cuts, earth tones). It narrowed down what I looked for and bought which made it easier.  Now, two months later, I have a cute little capsule wardrobe, and I LOVE every piece.  I guess that was a really long winded way to say, wear what you want and what inspires you in the morning. Especially now when no one is around to judge you while you are just "trying things out".	episode_done:True

text:Yeah, if we don’t go out we slump and slouch watching tv eating food. That’s a great way to ruin some special pieces. If i’m out then i’m fine with standing straight and not being reclined. I need to plan some events so I can wear those pieces.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Difficulty distinguishing between so 'idealized' style and personal style?	labels:Do you know Daria Andronescu? She has a youtube channel and a blog that deals with what you are experiencing. A while ago she published a template that allows you to calculate how many outifts you need based on what you do every week. Say you work from home, exercise at home and you only go out twice per week - this means you need much more comfortable clothes than "going out clothes". Based on that, and seeing what your life looks like for an entire season you can adjust your wardrobe accordingly. If you like a romantic/feminine style, you can still have it by picking loungewear that suits that style, that way you are more truthful to yourself and don't have to only wear hoodies. I think if you don't experiment with it you will never now.  I have a very feminine style I hated wearing hoodies around the house because they are not very fitted and make me feel sloppy and unproductive. I now wear tight but comfortable loungewear that is similar to what I would go for in my pre-covid life and I feel much more like myself.	episode_done:True
text:Difficulty distinguishing between so 'idealized' style and personal style?	labels:I struggle with what I like vs what looks good on me. I like the puff sleeve tight dress girly trend, but my inverted triangle body type could never.   I realize I’m more of a comfort/flatter shopper than style/color. I use trunk club now and it’s been amazing for picking out things that look good on me with safe picks and “just try it” picks. It’s helped me find what looks good on me so i have an easier time shopping and figuring out my style.	episode_done:True
text:Difficulty distinguishing between so 'idealized' style and personal style?	labels:Maybe start off from experimenting within the casual chic and sport chix styles?

Take it step by step and take your time	episode_done:True
text:Difficulty distinguishing between so 'idealized' style and personal style?	labels:I feel the same. My idealized self wears much more tailored and polished clothing (I really love Dearly Bethanys style). The reality is that I work as a social worker for former foster youth where I prefer to look relatable and not overly polished or “adult.” Ive definitely gotten comments from my clients that my style is “different” or “unique.” I live in a very rural and small community so fashion isn’t the highest priority here. I wear jeans and solid colored tee shirts, blouses or sweaters. I think I experiment with silhouettes to an extent- purchasing different denim styles like cropped wide leg, straight leg, mom jeans, etc. and shoes: I have a few pairs of mules, Veja sneakers, Nisolo boots... so things that are understated but I think still look more polished. I can’t really go too crazy with my footwear and outfits though...for example, last week I was in a home and an unrecognizable bug crawled up (and fell out) my pant leg. Sometimes that places I go into are not very clean and I just don’t know what I may be stepping in. I don’t really have any suggestions. Just wanted to say I relate. I’ve almost quit buying clothes for my fantasy wardrobe - but sometimes an item just catches my eye and I can’t pass it up even if I don’t have many places to wear it.	episode_done:True
text:Difficulty distinguishing between so 'idealized' style and personal style?	labels:Comfort is what will convince me to stick with something.  Dresses and comfy cardigans, flats, and ALL PANTS ARE STRETCHY - whether it's skinny or wide leg.  Also I have a lot of cute sweaters/sweatshirts because I lowkey go braless when wearing them.  Went crazy on walmart camis so I could wear them under button downs and also go braless.  Got a bunch of portofino/express button downs because the fabric is flexible, they are very wrinkle proof, and it's comfy.	episode_done:True
text:How do you guys who like a formal/business look manage to not look the same all the time?	labels:Accessories?  I guess switching it up with statement necklaces or earrings.  And shoes, having some really powerful statement shoes can go a long way to draw attention away from the fact that it's the same blouse you always wear.  But I also subscribe to the capsule wardrobe theory, so in general I'm not particularly bothered about wearing the same 10 outfits because I set myself up for that on purpose.
text:Ah man that’s such a good idea! I just wish I knew how to accessorize. I really want to get more into jewellery but don’t know where to start!!

text:How do you guys who like a formal/business look manage to not look the same all the time?	labels:Is this an pressure that is coming internally from you being bored or more externally from perceived social pressure or media pressure around you? It sounds like you know what you like and that you’ve already come up with outfits you love but feel pressure to be “new”. Reading about capsule wardrobes and minimalism may give you more justifications for repeating outfits that you love. If you are bored with your look, you could also try changing up your hair, make up, accessories and keep the outfits that make you feel powerful.
text:Wow that just made me think like actually. Just sat silently for a minute there. I’ve kind of always been a serial outfit repeater my whole life and it’s always been pointed out to me, and now that i have no one looking at me to point it out, I feel that bore. Super weird to think about but so interesting! It’s like I internalized it all those years. Thanks for pointing this out!	labels:Think of it this way.... some of the most powerful people in the world subscribe to a “uniform” so you are in good company. You have invested in good, tailored pieces. Wear them knowing they fit you well. You aren’t the person who has multiple outfits that don’t suit your body and or look sloppy.	episode_done:True

I don't know if you intend to wear THAT much black, but her sense of style is out of this world for business and casual. She makes formal attire a bit more fun and quirky while still being professional.

(Flashback to middle school when I thought colored pants were a replacement for a personality,, that was a dark time)	labels:Oh I know. The phrase “green jeans” still makes my stomach turn.

Now, two decades later I dress a bit more conservatively around my family. Just jeans, a nice top or light sweater and makeup in colors found in the natural world.

text:Tips for feeling confident when wearing stylish clothes around family?	labels:Ease into it slowly. Start with a few blouses that are more your new style preference, and wear them with jeans/leggings. It'll instantly add a bit of polish without looking too different. In the cool weather now, sweater dresses are sexy and stylish but also not too far off from a hoodie. long sweeping cardigans over sleeveless blouses/tops and leggings means that you can probably wear that same top when it gets warmer without the outer layer and people will already be used to it.     Also, Chances are there will still be days you want to wear that super comfy soft hoodie so keep some of your favs (take it from someone who found themselves owning zero sweat pants at the beginning of quarantine and had to walk live around in "dressy" pants for a few weeks). But also, there's nothing quite as comfy as a baggy hoodie on the weekend or if you just want to run out to do a quick errand without getting fully dressed up.	episode_done:True

text:My best fit ever was about three or four years ago where I was wearing ripped mom jeans with my dad's denim shirt and with a denim jacket on top, creating denim on denim on denim. That's when I peaked tbh	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Has anyone just said screw it and focused more on fit than color scheme for your outfits? What's an unlikely color combination that you ended up loving?	labels:That's kind of the point of fashion. Try whatever appeals to you and see if you like it or if it suits your needs. "Unlikely combinations" are what drives fashion forward.

text:Has anyone just said screw it and focused more on fit than color scheme for your outfits? What's an unlikely color combination that you ended up loving?	labels:Beyond just colors, quarantine has let me mix all kinds of styles I wouldn't have put together a year ago. Tan leather mules with track pants? Yes, because I need to put on something to get the mail, but also it works somehow. Being able to experiment in this low-stakes environment has opened up all kinds of possibilities for me.	episode_done:True
text:Has anyone just said screw it and focused more on fit than color scheme for your outfits? What's an unlikely color combination that you ended up loving?	labels:My wardrobe largely consists of really loud colors and equally loud prints, but I generally offset the loudness by wearing neutral sweaters and other accessories. I haven’t typically been into hot pink, but I just bought a Barbie-esque hot pink cardigan because it was on sale and I needed WFH pandemic sweaters. And SURPRISE! Turns out hot pink is actually a neutral for me; it goes with most of my clothes, and I really wouldn’t have guessed it.  Edit: color combos so far have been hot pink and navy blue/gold, hot pink and red/white, hot pink and blue/purple, hot pink and baby blue, hot pink and green/black, hot pink and....everything really.	episode_done:True
text:Has anyone just said screw it and focused more on fit than color scheme for your outfits? What's an unlikely color combination that you ended up loving?	labels:I have a brown and mint tie dye flare shirt that pairs so well with a pair of rust colored linen pants. An unlikely outfit made from the desperation of laundry day coinciding with a work day.	episode_done:True
text:Has anyone just said screw it and focused more on fit than color scheme for your outfits? What's an unlikely color combination that you ended up loving?	labels:I found a way to wear red and green recently without looking like a Christmas tree and my mind was blown! The red was more of a muted, terra-cotta color and the green was that pacific, dark blue-green that’s been so popular the last year or so.   Also recently found out that wearing a denim jacket with jeans was a bold style move but I’ve been doing it for years not knowing it might be a fashion mistake. 😂	episode_done:True

text:Tucking in shirts	labels:I switched to tucking in my shirts a couple years ago and I've never looked back! What really helped me was to  1) Be strict about only tucking shirts in to high-waisted pants. That way, it shows off my waist, rather than my food baby from lunch. I was tempted to cheat with mid-rise jeans at first, but have felt so much better about myself since I stopped.  2) After you tuck your shirt in, raise your arms above your head to create a slight blousy look-- not being skin tight helps get rid of any insecurities.  Hope that helps! Oversize men's shirts tucked into high-waisted shorts are pretty much my uniform, so I never miss an opportunity to evangelize 😄
text:Yup that’s how I do it as well. I love the high waisted jeans from Madewell and I’m short torso’d so that’s saying something.... 👍🏻	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Tucking in shirts	labels:I don’t think it’s awkward! I was very self-conscious when I was younger and wore nothing but tunic tops, but over time I’ve gotten more confident and now I basically tuck in everything that I can. Give it a try, maybe just for one day, to see how you feel, and if you like it you don’t have to do it again! But I bet it looks cute in addition to being comfy :)	episode_done:True
text:Tucking in shirts	labels:Belts! If you’re worried about your booty showing, a belt will help. Also hides the waistband. I vote just going for it tho! If you’re comfortable, that will help you feel less awkward. Fidgeting with an uncomfortable piece of clothing is the worst for outfit confidence. Comfort is key! Just do it, and keep doing it and you will feel less weird about it.	episode_done:True
text:Tucking in shirts	labels:Invest in a good belt - I felt exactly the same but the belt changes the whole look and makes it look so effortlessly polished!	episode_done:True
text:Tucking in shirts	labels:i tuck everything in. literally everything. shirts, blouses, sweatshirts, sweaters.. even my kimonos. it’s fun to me to play around with what works and what doesn’t work.   as someone said, chuck on a cardigan and see how you feel with your shirt tucked in. it can be weird at first, especially if you‘ve never done it before	episode_done:True
text:Tucking in shirts	labels:When I was younger I probably thought it was too dorky. These days I care less and I also realize that it helps me look more proportional by visually shortening my torso and lengthening my legs, so I'd much rather do that. In many cases it's more flattering for me (and maybe for you) because it cinches in my waist a little. I'm short, so it can be tricky to look proportional.  For button-down shirts I normally tuck the front, like a french tuck. Tucking it in all around is usually too formal for me.	episode_done:True
text:Tucking in shirts	labels:I love a French tuck, just a little of the front of your shirt right at or beside the button. A half tuck looks great too with button downs especially.	episode_done:True
text:Tucking in shirts	labels:Start with the French tuck!  Just tuck in a little of the front of your shirt to get used to it, then work towards the tuck you want.  I’m just getting comfortable with the full tuck now.

text:Everytime I try the french tuck, it doesn't look intentional, but it looks like I accidentally tucked my shirt in when I went to the bathroom or something. I don't know if it is my body shape or what but I feel like it always looks sloppy on me, even when I spend ten minutes in front of the mirror trying to master it.	labels:This! I feel the same exact way as you! Any type of tucking makes me feel even more short waisted, sloppy, and awkward. I have a really short torso/waist and bigger breasts, which seems to be the opposite body type made for tucking haha
text:Same body type, also not a fan of tucking 90% of the time because of it	labels:Same!	episode_done:True
text:Tucking in shirts	labels:I definitely deal with this too. My best advice, like many others here, is to tuck with high-waisted pants.  I also highly recommend tucking your shirt into your underwear and pulling your pants over them; it creates a smoother look!	episode_done:True

text:Share what are your quick tips to always look polished !	labels:I have 2 pups and have accepted that I will always have dog hair on me.   Back when I wore more business clothes, I would have separate at home and work clothes. Changed out of my work clothes as soon as I got home and into sturdier/less expensive outfits.   Also recommend keeping a lint roller in the car.   To generally look polished: add an accessory like a scarf, earrings or a necklace.   I’m also a fan of tucking shirts/sweaters.
text:Same! I have a very fluffy brown and white pup and my wardrobe is all black. I change last thing before I leave and first thing when I get back. These two sets of clothes don’t get mixed in the laundry EVER.   My dryer does a pretty good job of removing pet hair from the home clothes as well. And the lint roller is essential.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:IKEA lint rollers. They last a while, they’re cheap, they work. I buy them literally by the dozen. All bathrooms, bedroom, living room, car, office (back when we still went to an office).	labels:Yes 🙌   The IKEA ones do a good job too	episode_done:True
text:Share what are your quick tips to always look polished !	labels:See, my general decision is to avoid fabrics with these issues, at least in my everyday wardrobe. Am I fine ironing and lint-rolling an outfit for a night out (not that I have those anymore)? Yes. But am I going to do this for each outfit I wear in a week? No.
text:Agreed - I feel like looking polished is more about the absence of things. No wrinkles, piling, lint, loose threads, etc.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Share what are your quick tips to always look polished !	labels:I tuck everything in because 1. I’m 5’3 and with wide hips, this makes me look more in shape 2. Looks like I have longer legs 3. Looks like I care a little hahaha	episode_done:True

text:Share what are your quick tips to always look polished !	labels:I have a dryer that has a wrinkle away setting... it’s 15 minutes, I throw in a few shirts and voila I’m wrinkle free for the week.

Now that it’s winter I pick a jacket as well.

text:(UPDATE) Ladies who miss fashion/makeup/getting dressed up... how are you doing?	labels:I'm just... still getting dressed up. This has actually given me a nice opportunity to try new combinations of outfits and pull out pieces that I wasn't sure about before. The routine of getting dressed and feeling put together is really important for me with regards to getting into the work mindset.
text:Same. I've never been an athleisure person, so living in leggings and sports bras was making me feel like a lump. It tells my brain "this is a stay-at-home-and-do-nothing day," even though that's DEFINITELY not correct 😂 I won't lie, there's a bigger role for leggings in my everyday wardrobe now than there used to be, but I'm just not one of those people who lives for comfort above all else—I need more to feel like the best version of myself.   Makeup and washing my hair make a big difference too. Why can't I feel like a productive human with greasy hair? Or without mascara? It's a WEIRD mental trick and I'm not totally sure I'm okay with it.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Agreed.   Definitely was starting to feel some depression/Groundhog Day while not getting dressed every day.   Picking out an outfit and doing makeup really help.   I’m also doing “date night” with my husband where we both get dressed up and put shoes on and have dinner at a real table and use our serving dishes.   Making more elaborate dishes and getting into the presentation has also helped me. I’m not feeling the need for time savers/convenience since I don’t ever leave the house.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Same.  When I worked in Antarctica, there obviously was no reason for me to put on makeup, do my hair, and put on nice clothes.  One season I worked in a lab and the other I was a contractor at the South Pole.  I still did it anyway.  I like how I look with makeup and my hair done so who cares if there's nobody there to appreciate it.   Now I'm back working a "regular" job in the lower 48.  I'm a pharmacist so I still have to go into work.  The only thing that's really changed is that I wear a headband with buttons on the side to save my ears.  I'm not a fan of wearing the same headband every day, but it does help with the pain immensely.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:(UPDATE) Ladies who miss fashion/makeup/getting dressed up... how are you doing?	labels:I just dress up anyways when I want to (most days). I am chronically ill and have to stay home a lot anyways, and I think I learned early on that getting dressed every day does a lot towards making you feel like a normal productive human bean.	episode_done:True
text:(UPDATE) Ladies who miss fashion/makeup/getting dressed up... how are you doing?	labels:I actually started working from home June '19, so I've been trying to hone in my look from "working retail in a major city, commuting on public transit and being gone for 14-16 hours a day, to living on an isolated mountain and only leave the house like every 10 days and being in my home studio.   I started an Ootd instagram I've hidden from all my family and friends to kind of... Keep track of what I'm actually wearing? Also my weight fluctuates A LOT. (Summer hiking and lots of walks, winter were snowed in....) So picking clothing now that changes with my weight and still feels... Pretty. (Wrap skirts, tshirt dresses, leggings, eleatic and tie waist bottoms are all life savers!!)   Get dressed every day, really. Even if it's just different sweats, the routine is good for the human brain.	episode_done:True

text:(UPDATE) Ladies who miss fashion/makeup/getting dressed up... how are you doing?	labels:I’ve tried to make it exiting by changing my style. We moved from NYC to London just before the pandemic hit so I’ve tried to take the opportunity of working from home and being in a new place to experiment.  I bought some things that are comfy and I actually want to put on without actually just wearing my pyjamas or sweats all day and that’s helped a lot. Stuff I probably never would have worn before like crazy patterned dungarees, doc marten boots and sweaters with clouds on them, etc. I figure now is a good time to experiment because no one is really seeing me anyway	episode_done:True
text:How do you style/match your footwear with your outfit ? Do you use colour blocking method ?	labels:Pretty much all my shoes are either black or white. When I do wear more statement shoes, I either match them to one of the colors in the outfit, or wear only neutral colors with the shoe being the pop of color.	episode_done:True
text:How do you style/match your footwear with your outfit ? Do you use colour blocking method ?	labels:I always follow the 3 colour rule, so no more than 3 colours in any outfit to make it look cohesive (I don’t count white as a colour, however). I don’t own any bold colour shoes, but if I did and were to say wear a red shoe, I might try to wear something else red in my outfit to tie it in, like a shirt or a bag. But I think a bold shoe would also look great with an all black outfit, or tied in with something simple like a belt.	episode_done:True
text:How do you style/match your footwear with your outfit ? Do you use colour blocking method ?	labels:Whenever possible, I try my match my shoes with my purse, and if that doesn’t work out I try to match with shirt/jacket. Doesn’t have to be an exact match but as long as both are either warm or cold toned I think it usually looks nice!	episode_done:True
text:How do you style/match your footwear with your outfit ? Do you use colour blocking method ?	labels:My wardrobe is fairly neutral, I tend to wear mostly white blacks and greys so I love a good statement shoe for some more personality.   I have a pair of bright turquoise patterened mules which I wear with a neutral outfit. I also have a bright red/orange pair of heels which tie in perfectly with a pair of formal paperbag trousers which have the same colour running through. Personally I like to bring in colour from one accessory - whether that's a scarf, bag, shoe, or jewellery.  I like to play with juxtaposition and so if I wear a very feminine outfit I like to pair it with some tougher shoes like Doc martens.	episode_done:True
text:How do you style/match your footwear with your outfit ? Do you use colour blocking method ?	labels:I try to think about my outfit as a balance beam. There has to be equal parts light and dark (unless it’s a special or formal event). If I wear a monotone outfit, I go with a contrasting or neutral color to support. if I’m wearing black slacks, I try to wear a top with pops of color in it. Then, I chose my shoes based on the color and complexity of the top. For casual wear I apply the same rule, but also take into consideration the style of bottom I’m wearing (I.e skinny jeans, yoga pants, boot cut, etc) and where I’m heading in the outfit. For example, a pair of yogas and a t could go with vans slip ons OR a pair of trainers. If I’m heading to grab lunch, I’ll wear vans. If I’m heading to the store, I’m more likely to put on the trainers.	episode_done:True
text:How do you style/match your footwear with your outfit ? Do you use colour blocking method ?	labels:i don’t like when things are “matchy matchy” (as one of my hs teachers used to say), so i go by a color scheme or will wear the one or two colors but different shades of the color(s). so my shoes tend to go well with whatever colors i’m already wearing, or they match my purse, belt, jacket, or other accessories.   i don’t think things have to match exactly or be the same exact colors. as long as it goes well together and looks good, it doesn’t really matter too much.	episode_done:True
text:How do you style/match your footwear with your outfit ? Do you use colour blocking method ?	labels:I have a lot of different shoes. So sometimes color blocking, sometimes whatever is comfiest. I do a lot with light outfits  is light shoes and vice versa. I also have a lotttt of unique shoes (think Irregular Choice) and so match my outfit to compliment the shoes	episode_done:True
text:How do you style/match your footwear with your outfit ? Do you use colour blocking method ?	labels:I mostly wear shoes, for my everyday thing I have chucks that are plain black, one that is grey and one that I sky blue for fancy basic looks lol. I tend to wear shoes with dresses as well cause idk I just lose my balance when I’m wearing sandals if that makes any sense	episode_done:True
text:How do you style/match your footwear with your outfit ? Do you use colour blocking method ?	labels:Sometimes I will match the color of my shoes to my top, but the majority of the time I choose a complimentary color with my jacket/top. Most of my shoes are white with various color accents. In the winter I really love choosing boots that will go with all of my jackets, I'm really passionate about my outerwear look haha. I have these burgundy/ purplish timberlands that will go great with the forest green coat I'm planning to buy (for example)   I'm not a fan of neutrals and black so my advice may be a bit niche!	episode_done:True
text:How do you style/match your footwear with your outfit ? Do you use colour blocking method ?	labels:Love this question! After I’ve determined my outfit, sometimes I have shoes already in mind if I want a specific silhouette, but if not I think about a purse and shoe combo to fit based on if I need to carry things or if I’ll be walking a bit. Most of my shoes, purses, and belts are either cognac brown leather (my weakness) or black leather, and in the styles I wear most like oxfords I like to have a version in each color leather.  Now that I think about it, the only color among my footwear is a pair of red pumps. Even my more casual shoes like Supergas are tan or white. I’d love to add more color to my footwear but I opt for quality first, which is more expensive, which makes me more likely to choose a color thats versatile (like cognac brown, which is again, my absolute weakness).	episode_done:True
text:Marilyn Monroe: Casual Style and Dressing for Men	labels:The problematic sexism aside, I appreciate that she shared her experiences.   The fact (to her) that women were her harshest critics is quite sad and also a very contemporary issue.   Her unabashed enjoyment of men is something that, at the time, was still quite taboo and I applaud that she makes no bones about it.   She seems very much her own person despite getting crap from all sides.  However, milk and raw eggs? I cannot get behind that one 😂	episode_done:True
text:Marilyn Monroe: Casual Style and Dressing for Men	labels:This is a place for discussion, so.. In my opinion, true womanhood is not tied to certain behaviors. What would those behaviors be, do you mean? How can you behave in a way that makes you less of a woman?  Being womanly isn't tied to wanting to doll up for men. Are you also saying that women that don't feel like they have to doll up in front of 10000 marines are lesser women because of it?   In my opinion, all of this is based on sexist views that once again, men are the true judges of what's sexy, what's a true woman, and what a woman should dress like and act like in order to be a real woman. You say this, but with different words, when you describe how men appreciate something that's more true than what women appreciate.  Can't we just appreciate fashion and clothes without having to *be* something?   Marilyn Monroe grew up in a man's world. 2020 is *supposed* to be 50/50.

text:Marilyn Monroe: Casual Style and Dressing for Men	labels:Interesting article, definitely put Marilyn Monroe in a different light for me.  I think her point in the second paragraph about the need for a distinct relationship between the body and clothing is worth further discussion. Recently I have noticed that some of the more interesting pieces on the runway for me are the ones that move with the body or play on the different silhouettes/proportions of the model so it does seem like there’s some merit in atleast this point of her response though I don’t know if this is what she intended.  I don’t know if I currently incorporate this concept into my own wardrobe though, maybe subconsciously but I’m not sure how I would go intentionally thinking about it
text:It’s so important to take into mind silhouettes and proportions.   Now that I’ve gained weight bc of quarantine, a lot of things that i use to be able to wear when I had a thigh gap, no longer look good on me. Skinnies make my legs look like tree trunks now, and straight legs look more like slim legs. I wear exclusively very straight (almost wide) leg “boy” jeans now and it makes my waist look smaller and balances out my top and bottom.   TLDR: I use to be more ruler prior to quarantine but I’m definitely a pear now and I have to be very careful that what I wear doesn’t make me look fatter.	labels:This reply made me sad. The idea that you have excluded an entire silhouette because of a recent body trend is depressing. I have never had a thigh gap nor will ever likely have one at a healthy weight. Your legs are not tree trunks, you do not need to hide them. They are carrying you through a very tumultuous and difficult period of life right now which is worth more than how slim they are. If you love straight fits now that is wonderful, but please don’t feel that you are now excluded from skinnies because of an Instagram trend.
text:It definitely made me depressed for a while because I was unconsciously expecting to look like the models in the pictures... but once the clothes got here I never did. And the massive amount of clothes in my wardrobe that didn’t fit me anymore didn’t help either.   I’ve come to learn that I need to be more body positive with myself. I have never had to deal with not being able to find clothes that fit, or snobby SAs that tell me “We don’t have anything for you”, so it’s a new experience.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Marilyn Monroe: Casual Style and Dressing for Men	labels:Definitely misogynistic and sexist, but it’s also the 1950s so that makes sense. I’m sure Marilyn herself didn’t realize that she was unconsciously being sexist and contributing to the problems that she (and other women) were facing. It’s kind of sad in a way when you think about it.
text:I think Marilyn was very conscious of what she was doing here. She carried a folksy persona, deliberately catering to working men and women, and had that "What do you mean by suspecting I'm dressing sexy by wearing dresses so tight they have to be sewn on, I can't help that I'm CURVY! It is those who think it's on purpose that are truly lewd!!"-vibe all the way through.   Basically, she tried to be as sexy as possible, but because that wasn't really allowed due to misogyny, she tried and mostly succeeded to pass it off as pure innocence. Here she is saying "I just want to please you guys, it's only natural - why do you judge me for being feminine? Men like feminine women bla bla" in an attempt to make the media be less judgmental about her livelihood.   She wasn't treated respectfully even though she was a huge star, because even though Holywood wanted a woman who was first and foremost sexy, they also judged and shamed the stars for trying to be exactly that. No wonder she was defensive about it - she lived up to the ideal the most, so she also had to be the spokesperson and defender of it.

Also I don’t believe she had control over what she could wear while on set or that very famous JFK dress. Her stylist probably styled her and she had little to no input into her outfits.

text:It’s fascinating that there was and still is a binary of “dressing for men” and “dressing for yourself [and other women]”. Which is a heteronormative and exclusionary way to put it, but I’m having trouble articulating everything. Both sides feel like they’re rebelling against the other, when for the most part people tend to participate in both. Both being, dressing for oneself and an audience that appreciates style without finding it sexually appealing and then the other side of dressing in part to be found sexually appealing by the group that you wish to attract. I agree that a lot of similar feelings towards what is considered “flattering” come up a lot here and it’s uncomfortable to try to get to the root of why that is.  I think a lot of her language doesn’t sit right with us because it’s assumed that every woman wishes to attract a man	labels:	episode_done:True

text:I think it’s so weird that people are saying she’s so outdated and misogynistic for saying she dresses for men when, by the way she describes it, most women still do. So many of the commenters here do the same as her, they just say, “I dress for myself in the context of modern fashion and culture which still is influenced by the male gaze”. I don’t see anything wrong with it besides the self delusion that these people are wearing makeup and heels just for themselves instead of the reactions they get from others. It’s the same thing! She just said it differently/ more straightforwardly. I do it too when I feel like and have zero shame. It’s fun to dress for men you like if you’re a straight woman.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Marilyn Monroe: Casual Style and Dressing for Men	labels:Definitely misogynistic and sexist, but it’s also the 1950s so that makes sense. I’m sure Marilyn herself didn’t realize that she was unconsciously being sexist and contributing to the problems that she (and other women) were facing. It’s kind of sad in a way when you think about it.
text:I think Marilyn was very conscious of what she was doing here. She carried a folksy persona, deliberately catering to working men and women, and had that "What do you mean by suspecting I'm dressing sexy by wearing dresses so tight they have to be sewn on, I can't help that I'm CURVY! It is those who think it's on purpose that are truly lewd!!"-vibe all the way through.   Basically, she tried to be as sexy as possible, but because that wasn't really allowed due to misogyny, she tried and mostly succeeded to pass it off as pure innocence. Here she is saying "I just want to please you guys, it's only natural - why do you judge me for being feminine? Men like feminine women bla bla" in an attempt to make the media be less judgmental about her livelihood.   She wasn't treated respectfully even though she was a huge star, because even though Holywood wanted a woman who was first and foremost sexy, they also judged and shamed the stars for trying to be exactly that. No wonder she was defensive about it - she lived up to the ideal the most, so she also had to be the spokesperson and defender of it. She was very much aware of her image.	labels:I think I didn’t properly explain what I meant.

Also wasn’t MM pretty much abused by her studio? It doesn’t seem very astute or a smart business decision of MM to not have changed studios or given them a side eye. So why didn’t she?  It doesn’t take a lot of brains to make it to the top like MM did, plenty of other pretty girls have done it before and after her. What takes brains is staying at the top and still staying relevant.
text:I think we'll have to agree to disagree. My memory is hazy on this, but I think she did try to start a company of her own or something, because she was so spiteful of how the studio controlled her. She tried to get better deals, because she was at times the actress who made the studio the most money, but was paid very little in relation to that. And she was incredibly passive-aggressive in meeting the studio's demands. You may be right that she handled it in a very naive and not very business-savvy way - but I definitely remember that she did fight for her rights a lot, but was met with resistance time and time again, from people who were more powerful than her. So maybe you're right that she was dumb, but she wasn't passive or unaware.   I think most women who do "cool girl" in real life are definitely very often misgoynist in some way. However, actresses today have to play the same game, and I think they do know. Like how almost every single actress who is interviewed on the matter of body image and dieting, claims to eat fries and pizza and stuff and is just so Naturally Skinny, and therefore not like those Other Girls.   Famous women have to meet strict standards, but they have to pretend that they do so completely by accident. Otherwise, they are punished for being attention seeking or self absorbed. Women should be admired as beautiful objects, but they can't ever try to achieve that on their own - that would be too active, direct, greedy. They have to be completely passive. Approval is something to be granted by others, though no effort of their own.	labels:[INVALID]	episode_done:True

You can respect Marilyn Monroe's role in history and like her style and still acknowledge that this is a sexist point of view that reduces the experience and value of women to their relationship with men's pleasure.   Also, as a subreddit, we do not prescribe to the belief that womanliness is tied to a certain type of body. A woman's body is womanly by nature of being the body of a woman.

text:Any advice for overcoming self consciousness/self doubt when you're trying to step out of your comfort zone and expand your style?	labels:Okay so one thing I like to do is wear my new clothes around in the house, so I can get used to the feel of wearing it, even if it’s still in private. Also helps to listen to some of your favourite upbeat songs so you start associating the clothes with positive emotions!   In the past, I’ll sometimes tell one friend that I’m testing out a new item, and go out with that friend. That way, they can a) hype me up and b ) act as a buffer between questions. (Ex: “Oh why are you dressed so fancy today?” “Idk, but I’m loving this new look on you buttermybackside!”)
text:My styles always been a bit bland so I can’t say much but when I try new outfits or something out of the/my ordinary. I’ll ask friends first because they will criticise or compliment me, and tell me what to adjust or change, how I look etc. Unlike my family who has absolutely no filter and blurts the first thing that comes to mind.  I recommend you try it too, get comfortable with yourself first and wearing it, even just around the house, and then slowly expose your new style to everyone around you and wearing it in the different environments (?) like wearing jeans and heels to the pub or out shopping/running errands	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Any advice for overcoming self consciousness/self doubt when you're trying to step out of your comfort zone and expand your style?	labels:I don't think it's strange to feel that way! I tend to have a very eclectic style and enjoy trying out new unique/vintage charity shop finds, and this is something I've always struggled a little with.  This is one of these things where it just depends on whether you fit the occasion practically. For example, if you turn up to play a rugby game in stilettos, or go out into a snowstorm with just a cardigan, that's not a good idea. But is there any *practical* reason why you can't dress up a little more for drinks with friends?  With looks I'm less confidwnt on, I tend to go for practice runs first - that usually means just wearing it to the supermarket or to run errands where I'm not likely to see anyone I know, so I didn't have to worry about people's preconceptions. Sometimes I just try them on in my room and have a little dance party to some funky music, and that's still a way of getting used to seeing yourself in something!  There's always going to be someone who makes a comment about how you're 'very dressed up', or similar. These comments aren't usually even meant to be rude, but they often play into the little outfit insecurities that you already have! But the best part about this is that these kinds of comments get old pretty fast.  For every person who thinks you aren't standing out in a good way, there's going to be 10 people who admire your style and wished they could be as brave, even if they probably don't vocalise it. I can think of countless times where I saw an outfit I liked on a friend or stranger, but didn't actually say anything about it!	episode_done:True
text:Any advice for overcoming self consciousness/self doubt when you're trying to step out of your comfort zone and expand your style?	labels:I also start by wearing new things at home, then out to errands at the grocery store.

text:Any advice for overcoming self consciousness/self doubt when you're trying to step out of your comfort zone and expand your style?	labels:1. Being “overdressed” is an absolute myth people have created to hate on other people who are doing what makes them feel great.  2. I’m currently going through this transition myself. What’s helped me is really just trying things on that I like but may not necessarily be in my comfort zone and pairing it with someone familiar. So maybe I wear a fancy, feminine top and pair it with some boyfriend jeans (something I wear every day) to help balance it out!	episode_done:True
text:Any advice for overcoming self consciousness/self doubt when you're trying to step out of your comfort zone and expand your style?	labels:I think part of it is just being able to push through that feeling of embarrassment. One of the ways I've got over that in past is to wear something truly ridiculous out and about. It's embarrassing, but it's also very freeing. When I was in high school I wore my mom's wedding dress to class one day - and I think after handling a situation like that I realized that being a big weirdo is very freeing. After doing that, I'd be hard pressed to feel self-conscious about just wearing a regular dress, or heels, or whatever. In comparison those sorts of things become quite tame.   It is empowering to detach from that feeling of self-consciousness and recognize that everyone feels that way. And if you are able to relinquish yourself from that self-consciousness, you have a certain type of power and courage that a lot of people around you do not have. It's empowering to make choices that satisfy yourself, and then to stand up for those choices in front of other people.   You can be in charge of your own narrative. Maybe you're not over-dressed, maybe everyone else is under-dressed. Maybe people make comments - but at least that means that you are interesting enough to notice. Or it gives you a chance to be honest, and really connect with people - there's nothing stopping you from saying, "Yeah, I really want to have a different style and I'm trying to get over the hurdle of changing it!" Because that's something that a lot of people would understand and find relatable.   Convincing yourself is just a matter of internalizing these things.	episode_done:True
text:Any advice for overcoming self consciousness/self doubt when you're trying to step out of your comfort zone and expand your style?	labels:I typically just start by wearing them to places like the grocery store first. By my logic, there have been several times where I have worn a cocktail dress and heels there just to pick something up and have not given myself a second thought about doing so, so why should a bright shoe, or another item of clothing I am self conscious about be any different? Likewise, I have also seen many people at the grocery store in some cool items, and will not be thinking about it for more than 5 seconds.   After that if I still wasn’t completely confident I would probably try to wear it to a small gathering with family or close friends.   I also just try to keep in mind that nobody cares about what I am wearing as much as I do. Honestly, most people are too obsessed with thinking about themselves and if others are noticing their insecurities to spend more than a few seconds, if that, on a stranger. As long as you like your item, be confident in it and others will notice your confidence much more than the item.	episode_done:True
text:Any advice for overcoming self consciousness/self doubt when you're trying to step out of your comfort zone and expand your style?	labels:1. Don't think of compliments as criticism. There are a few bad bananas out there who will actually try to bring you down, but for the most part, people ask "Why are you dressed like that?" simply to make conversation (and it's really a compliment -- you look nice!).   2. Treat yourself like a friend. If a friend told you she wanted to change up her style but was nervous about getting comments, would you encourage her or tell her she's being weird? You'd encourage her! So stop discouraging yourself.	episode_done:True
text:Any advice for overcoming self consciousness/self doubt when you're trying to step out of your comfort zone and expand your style?	labels:The beauty with fashion is that there are so many middle grounds! To venture out of your comfort zone, some ideas are:  - Wear kitten heels or pretty pumps instead of boots. Practically speaking, they'll also be more comfy than stilettos  - Try to incorporate one item of pattern or bold colour which you like into your wardrobe. Plan ahead and style it in different ways with your existing wardrobe, according to different  circumstances (e.g. casual lunch, work day, nice dinner out), and wear it when you get the chance  - Stop thinking too much about what others think and try to identify what looks and things you like instead.   - I prefer to dress for the occasion (e.g. it'd be silly to wear a little black dress with heels if I'm going for a countryside visit), but you can still look nice doing so for whatever event! In the countryside example, I would dig out some nice cable knit jumper paired with jeans, my Barbour and a lovely woollen scarf, plus chunky boots. Equally I could style that with a cute skirt instead of jeans if there's less climbing over stiles and more visits to village pubs and quaint coffee shops. (Not that there's any chance to do the above anytime soon. #bloodyCovid)	episode_done:True
text:Any advice for overcoming self consciousness/self doubt when you're trying to step out of your comfort zone and expand your style?	labels:It can be hard. My style is vintage/repro/sometimes a bit pin up.   I get these comments a lot. Sometimes they seem a bit bitchy.   I try remember that my clothes make me happy. I’m just not a jeans and T-shirt women. And that I’m not overdressed. A lot of people are underdressed.

text:How do you search for and find clothes from pinterest?	labels:I think it just comes down to learning the vocab. You might search "pleated miniskirt" for the skirt, or "dark green tennis skirt," I think your problem might be that you're running into different types of pleated skirts. And for the top maybe "bib front blouse", "peter pan collar blouse", "tuxedo blouse" depending on which of those elements appeals to you (I'm not 100% sure what the blouse is though).	episode_done:True

text:How would you describe the quality of self-knit/self-made clothes vs. store bought?	labels:It would depend on the skill and machinery of the sewist - I have definitely made clothes that I like and will likely keep wearing, but they’re not the most structurally beautiful garments and are not the same quality craftsmanship you’d get from a higher end brand. Part of it is equipment - I don’t have a serger which is used a lot in clothing making - and part of it is I’m not that concerned about the seams on the inside of a garment that only I will ever wear. That being said, if I had taken the time to do proper seams, there is no reason those garments wouldn’t last just as long as higher end garments.
text:For sewn pieces the investment in equipment needed to approach commercial operations is feasible for an individual, but in knitwear or complicated embroidery there's just no competition. 3D and digital looms are $$$$ and what a consumer pays for good yarn is a multiple of a large operation.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How would you describe the quality of self-knit/self-made clothes vs. store bought?	labels:All the woollens that my mother made for us at home are still surviving 25 years of use. I think the self knit stuff is just made with better quality things  (might be a function of $), and they survive thousands of machine wash.  Same thing with cotton stuff I picked up. Survived 15 years and still going strong.	episode_done:True
text:How would you describe the quality of self-knit/self-made clothes vs. store bought?	labels:Many store-bought knits are made from cheap, synthetic blends that tend to pill faster. Manufacturers sometimes take short cuts and will simply cut pieces from knitted fabric whereas a handknitted item is knit to a particular shape with increases and decreases worked into the design. With mass production, knitted pieces that are sewn together will be more likely to have imperfections, like the arm seam and side seam not meeting up. There are details in hand knits that are too expensive to replicate on a mass-produced scale so you're probably less likely to see knits with intricate details.  For sewing, I tend to choose quality fabrics because I hate cheap synthetics and like my points for knitting, they can age poorly. I've seen RTW items with crooked stripes, missed stitching on binding, inconsistent sizing, etc. These are things that a sewist will likely take the time to avoid or correct.   Finer details are disappearing from a lot of RTW we see because it's too expensive or time-consuming, like blind hems, lining, etc. We're seeing more elastic waists, offset sleeves, stretchy fabrics, S/M/L sizes instead of numbered sizes and other details that make the fit more forgiving so it fits more customers. Something like those retro dresses with fitted bodices made from a woven fabric are rare for RTW because the fit would be so finicky. The majority of wedding dresses are strapless because it's a pain to have fitted sleeves, especially in a non-stretch fabric. You're able to satisfy a much wider customer base by eliminating details like those. If you sew your clothes, you can choose to do something with a more particular fit.	episode_done:True

text:Not to mention the quality of the fabric used. I sew and consider myself an average sewist. If I take the time and have a good pattern and quality fabric I feel my clothes are pretty decent. Probably not equal to very high end, but because I can adjust fit very early in the process they can look better than fast fashion with fit issues.  That being said not everything I make turns out like I hoped it would. But I have several items of clothing that I have been wearing for years and I will wear until they wear out because they fit, are completely my style, and I love them.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How would you describe the quality of self-knit/self-made clothes vs. store bought?	labels:My handknit sweaters look great and have lasted much longer than my store bought sweaters. They are typically made from better materials ( i.e. natural vs. acrylic yarn) and I do tend to baby them because they took me so long to produce, which may be a big part of it.	episode_done:True
text:How would you describe the quality of self-knit/self-made clothes vs. store bought?	labels:My husband sews and has hand-stitched several garments that he wears nearly daily. They are holding up fine, some of them after years. He doesn't do anything special to care for them, he throws them in the washer and dries them in the drier on warm. His interest is mainly in historical recreation, and as he points out, laundering clothes used to consist of beating the fuck out of them with a paddle. Our modern washers are *way* more gentle.

text:How would you describe the quality of self-knit/self-made clothes vs. store bought?	labels:I have a diploma in fashion design and worked in the industry off and on for 15 years, and have been a hobby knitter for about 20 years, I would say creating something that looks store bought takes far fewer hours of practice, and there's far less to know with knitting.  Knitting is just so much more rudimentary.  Once you learn the basic stitches and get a decent tension, you are pretty much on your way, if you are patient and can follow basic instructions like a recipe, you'll make something good.  Be thorough, swatch and block, and buy good yarn.  I think one if the biggest issues I see with home sewists is incorrect fabric choice, it makes a very big difference in a finished product, and is usually my first tip that something is homemade.  Notions are another big one, good quality, professional looking notions are a lot harder to find in retail stores.  Stitch choices, stitch quality, proper cutting, finishing methods are also all big giveaways that make stuff look unprofessional, and unless you have industrial machines and tools, some of that is out of your control.  But with enough practice you can get some pretty decent homemade products in a lot of clothing categories.  Stuff like jeans, leather, fur, swimwear, I think are always best left to professionals with specialized tools.  Reading up on fabrics and practicing high end finishing techniques is a good start.	episode_done:True
text:How would you describe the quality of self-knit/self-made clothes vs. store bought?	labels:Absolutely in terms of knitting, there's no reason why a knit wouldn't last just as long and be better quality. I can source local wool, hand dyed, etc., and that would be very hard to find in retail. I don't sew but I assume it would be the same, using all the proper techniques.	episode_done:True
text:How would you describe the quality of self-knit/self-made clothes vs. store bought?	labels:I knit but do not sew. My hand knit garments are, in my opinion, much nicer than anything I buy. I can customize the pattern to fit me perfectly and I use very high-quality materials. That said, I am also kinder to my hand knit garments than to my store bought ones. I was them by hand and only when needed. This could also be a factor.	episode_done:True
text:How would you describe the quality of self-knit/self-made clothes vs. store bought?	labels:I am a sewist with just over 1 year if experience, and my handmade clothes are without a doubt better quality than fast fashion store bought, comparable or better than mid-range (ie I always fully line things, I use French seams or bias bound seams and hand picked zippers rather than overlocker seam finishes as you get in almost all store bought clothes) and I wouldn't know about high end because I don't shop anywhere that fancy. The difference for me is I now spend the money on high quality fabric - organic cotton, 100% sandwashed linen, hemp and bull denim, tencel and lyocell blends etc. Often even mid to higher end clothes are not made with the highest quality natural fibers and it really makes a difference in wear and tear. I also use good quality thread which makes a big difference. Because I only sew for myself, I can take as long as I want doing beautiful seam finishes, fitting garments correctly, and more. My home sewn clothes get worn daily and I have to admit its really ruined shopping for me, even op shopping, because now my standards for fit, fabric and finish are quite high. I'm in no way a professional, simply someone who loves to sew and feels she deserves the clothes of her dreams. I do treat my clothing kindly though - I wash less, hang dry and repair or repurpose what I can.	episode_done:True
text:Somebody else loosing so much time to choose the right item to buy when looking for something? I feel it cost me more in time when I try to buy responsibly.	labels:The “thrill of the hunt” is kind of my favorite part of shopping tbh. I enjoy the process of:  1. Get inspired  2. Figure out keywords for exactly what I’m looking for  3. Search poshmark endlessly for the thing that’s juuuust right   Even if I don’t necessarily buy “the thing” it keeps me from doom scrolling on Facebook all day 😄	episode_done:True
text:Somebody else loosing so much time to choose the right item to buy when looking for something? I feel it cost me more in time when I try to buy responsibly.	labels:Yup exactly. It's a combination of getting the item you want, made with the right ethics, and for the right price. I try for all three and manage about a third of the time (second hand item from an ethical producer that looks right and fits). For other things I give up on one, i.e. raincoat that fits the first two categories but is new and therefore £££, or underwear that doesn't fit great but is ethical and moderately priced.      On the plus side, in theory they'll last longer than an item made to a lower standard, so less time spent buying in the long run.     You don't need to be in love with the item for it to be the right one though. It's nice when that's the case, but for many things lowering the bar a bit to functional+ethical is probably more achievable.	episode_done:True
text:Somebody else loosing so much time to choose the right item to buy when looking for something? I feel it cost me more in time when I try to buy responsibly.	labels:A while back I was watching a YouTube video that mentioned the best way to learn about something is to make all of your passive entertainment geared towards that thing.  It was specifically talking about designer fashion, but I think it's something that can be applied to any kind of fashion.  Personally, I'm more of a shop local/thrift sort of person, but if I were to go out of my way to find a specific product, it would take a lot less time on my part because I follow people with a similar outlook.  The Youtubers I watch are concerned about buying ethically/in an environmentally conscious way.  Most people I follow on Instagram are about my height/size.  When I'm watching TV I'll open up Depop and to my lists when something catches my eye.  About half the work is done for me, and when I need something, I spend a lot less time actively searching.  I started a wardrobe overhaul last year so I do get how sometimes it can feel like you'll never find exactly what you're looking for, but maybe finding some people doing the same can help.	episode_done:True

text:Somebody else loosing so much time to choose the right item to buy when looking for something? I feel it cost me more in time when I try to buy responsibly.	labels:For me, it's not time-consuming. This might be because in a shopping year, I'm shopping at least one season ahead. I also pop into thrift shops regularly for 5-10 mins at a time with a strict list. The list doesn't just include clothes, so my successful trips tend to be high. I don't thrift shop online. The one time I took the risk, I regretted it. It's way more expensive and it's risky so I don't bother with it.	episode_done:True

Even with a capsule, at some point something will get damaged or need replacement.  I am phasing in real fabrics, but not relinquishing the poly dresses n such that I still enjoy.  I look to all kinds of designers I’d never afford or wear for inspiration. Heck, I get excited just to see what the mom on schitts creek wears.  I know now what I want in leather and am not opposed to carrying a quality non-designer bag .   You live n learn. Got a coach bag this year. The leather is crap. Finally said no more.

text:Somebody else loosing so much time to choose the right item to buy when looking for something? I feel it cost me more in time when I try to buy responsibly.	labels:I feel the same way! I can be super picky when it comes to clothes. I know exactly what I want and what would look good on me but it's hard to find both in stores with a limited selection but it's also hard in the endless sea of clothes that is Poshmark/ThreadUp.   Sometimes online shopping makes it easier to filter things out but other times it makes things harder and not being able to try it on is a huge downside. I have so many things from Poshmark that I've just donated because I didn't like the fabric or the fit.   What don't you love about the clothes out there you're seeing right now? Is it the style, fit, color, etc.?	episode_done:True

text:Somebody else loosing so much time to choose the right item to buy when looking for something? I feel it cost me more in time when I try to buy responsibly.	labels:Yeah, shopping responsibly and buying only from more sustainable/ethical brands can be frustrating and time consuming.   I've found having a go to list of brands I've purchased from before is a good way to narrow down a search. For one-off more specialist purchases, I start looking early and just accept it's going to take a while before I buy what I need.
text:Do you have example of brands that are for you a staple? I'm from Canada, it might not be available but who knows !	labels:It depends what I'm looking for but Organic Basics for underwear, Linen Fox for main wardrobe pieces (their style is exactly what I enjoy wearing), People Tree and Thought Clothing although they're a different to my style they do have some good basic wardrobe pieces.	episode_done:True

text:yea, Im pretty sad they are so long. I am not into the crop look for winter but when I was looking at details I just saw regular and assumed they would be around 28 inches( didnt see the 30.5 inch measurment online at the time). As someone that's 5'5 I didnt expect a regular length to be to long. Im not sure if I want to pay the 8 dollar return fee again though to go for the crops since I'm having a hard time getting past other fit issues  I might try the rebel pants instead as its stated they are meant for curvier types. I do not like the fitted look though, I prefer the straight leg, I just think they bunch because they are to long	labels:Eh I think that it’s great piece for fall/winter bc you can wear big sweaters to hide the other fit issues. By the time summer comes, you definitely won’t be wearing them. But if it’s only $8 for something you might like better and actually wear, then I would bite the bullet. Better than these sitting in your closet and never wearing them, or taking a loss and selling them.	episode_done:True

text:I actually would disagree that it makes them look dated. That baggy look where it goes over the shoes a bit is a huge trend right now.

text:Cold weather friendly skirts and dresses	labels:I second every comment suggesting tights!   I live in Montana and have put up with many frigid winters without having to sacrifice my love for long skirts and flower-child dresses.

text:Cold weather friendly skirts and dresses	labels:Shorts under a skirt go a long way to keeping you warm. I cut off a pair of lightweight long underwear (cuddleduds but the brand doesn’t matter) and with boots basically just your knees are exposed.

text:Cold weather friendly skirts and dresses	labels:I really like short skirts ... autumnal and wintery tones like navy blue, burgundy, sienna, and dark green are favourites of mine. I like flared/skater/pleated skirts. **Fleece lined tights** are your friend here!! They keep you warm and covered. I absolutely despise long skirts though, so that's just me. Also, especially with a short skirt, don't underestimate the power of footwear when making or breaking an outfit.	episode_done:True
text:Cold weather friendly skirts and dresses	labels:Layers layers layers. I live in Canada and our winters get nasty. Long skirts are a must if you want to wear one. Any exposed skin is dangerous and will immediately make you lose warmth very quickly. Wools are fantastic in the winter. They naturally wick away dampness and hold in heat even if wet. Silks are next because they are similar, but they don't breath as well or hold in warmth as well. Avoid cottons like the plague. If they get wet they will sap heat away from you and this can be fatal. I avoid polyester whenever possible unless maybe as a waterproof outer layer. Leathers are a great outerlayer that is generally water resistant.  If I am going to be outside for a length of time in a skirt I wear merino wool leggings from icebreaker if it's cold enough under the skirt. You can also wear another skirt under the first one, or a third, go nuts. Also add boots that make it to around the end of the skirt, or a pair of socks over the tights to extend the coverage. Don't forget your toes, fingers and head. You can bundle up as much as possible but if you forget those you basically undid everything. Your core is much warmer than your extremities.  Also, don't make the layers too tight. You keep warm so long as the air around your body is warm, so you need loose ish styles to seal in not just you, but warm air.  This being said. I would not recommend any serious bushwhacking in heavy skirts and deep snow.	episode_done:True

text:Hey, do you find that they stretch out in the waist after wear?	labels:Yep, just like the below comment said, I would def size down with my next pair but I personally don't find the stretch horrible. They are wearable and comfy and hold their shape elsewhere, but just the waist seems to have loosened up a bit.	episode_done:True

text:What are your favorite straight leg jeans?	labels:Hi, my favorite for years are DL 1961 Coco Curvy straight jeans.  I recommend sizing down 1 size from your usual as they rung big.  They are a little long on me.  I'm 5'4.  I also like the Mara ankle ones also from DL 1961 and The Mari high rise(almost the same name, very confusing) from AG.  I also just bought Jen7 by Seven --a straight ankle length & I really like them.  I buy most of my jeans at Nordstrom Rack or Bloomingdales on Sale.  I don't believe in every paying full price but I really think getting a good deal on premium denim is worth it!  Hope that helps!	episode_done:True
text:People with crazy hair, how do you plan your outfits to go with your hair color?	labels:My hair is bright purple now, and has been blue.  I do adjust what I wear with it- reds or oranges can look overwhelming- but still dress pretty brightly! I stick to cool colors + neutrals (white, black, grey) so nothing clashes overmuch with the hair, and try not to wear the *exact* shade of purple as a shirt or dress (then I look like a crayon).  Wearing just black and white tends to glam me up a bit, at which point the hair acts as a bold accessory.	episode_done:True

text:People with crazy hair, how do you plan your outfits to go with your hair color?	labels:I currently have green hair (but i’ve had it a bunch of colors in the past), and I don’t plan my outfits around my hair! I find that it doesn’t really clash because most people (myself included), don’t factor in their hair color when they’re planning an outfit! I guess I probably wouldn’t wear head to toe green but that’s about it!	episode_done:True
text:People with crazy hair, how do you plan your outfits to go with your hair color?	labels:My hair was a bright blue/purple for a while, and I definitely had to alter my wardrobe to accommodate it. The colors I'd been used to wearing clashed badly with my hair, so I shifted my wardrobe toward colors that suited it. I didn't necessarily plan my outfits to match it, but I wanted to be sure that nothing I wore clashed. When I eventually went back to my natural color, I had to once again get rid of some wardrobe pieces and replace them!	episode_done:True
text:People with crazy hair, how do you plan your outfits to go with your hair color?	labels:I've been pretty much every colour of the rainbow, hair wise.  Currently I'm rocking my natural colour (brunette) with fluorescent pink tips.  I typically wear a wardrobe of black/grey/white, so my many hair colours never really clashed.  These days, I've opened up myself to a few new colours (green and burgundy mostly), and I like the contrast they give with my tips.    For me, my limited colour palette let my hair take center stage!	episode_done:True
text:People with crazy hair, how do you plan your outfits to go with your hair color?	labels:Not actually a crazy color, but I dyed my hair a natural-looking red for a while. But burgundy looked weird with it, so I dyed it back blonde because burgundy is my favorite color to wear.	episode_done:True
text:People with crazy hair, how do you plan your outfits to go with your hair color?	labels:Literally gave up my colored hair for this reason :( it's so hard to wear any colors with neon hair...

text:People always shit on creators when they do this - I know several instances of female creators, whether they're bloggers, writers, show runners etc. that get shat on because they pull the plug when their hand is forced and THEIR project is turning into something they hate or have no control over.   And people never ever shut up about how it was a selfish, childish 'fuck you' but never stop to think that it was THEIR project to do whatever they fuck they wanted with. People don't respect artistic and non-traditional business endeavors so they will never understand the issue with handing it over to someone else or compromising on the voice or vision of the project.   They forced her hand and she shut it down, good for her. If she were a man, people would be bending over backwards to applaud her. 🙄🙄	labels:	episode_done:True

text:(Man) Repeller: A postmortem	labels:I started following manrepeller around when it started - it was around when I graduated college and fashion blogs were still big. I always liked Leandra' styling, and later the style pieces on manrepeller. it never bothered me that they often showed clothes that were expensive - I mean, have you ever read a fashion magazine? you expect that in well-curated fashion content people will be wearing things that you yourself can't afford. it's inspirational, not a how-to.  Anyway, I felt like the lifestyle content they were trying to expand to more and more was their weakest point. We expect our fashion magazines to show us $900 items, we don't necessarily want to see models flaunting generational wealth and writing a 1,000-word thinkpiece about it. And the more they pushed lifestyle pieces and less fashion, I worried that they wouldn't last too much longer.  But also, maybe Leandra's time just came? It's rare for a blog or website to stay trendy for 10-ish years. MR started as a sort of hipster-gossip girl hybrid and I feel like that era is just over. I think the events of 2020 made MR's demise faster, but it was probably coming.	episode_done:True

text:I think this is a bit of a disingenuous reading. Leandra voluntarily stepped back because her statements about Black Lives Matter in June were so off the mark, and the accusations of racism and her role in perpetuating an unsafe and unfair environment for POC employees spiraled from there. I don't know about the gossip, but to pull the plug without giving her employees the time to actually demonstrate their new vision, or even make preparations for being on the job market during a pandemic--maybe it's the behavior of a typical investor/owner, but it's not the "humble, always learning/growing" persona she has been putting out since the summer. I am a little tired of people getting away with cruel capitalist bullshit just because they are women. That's the whole "girlboss" conundrum and I'm glad it's dying out. I was excited to see what the staff did to turn the site around, but they weren't even given the chance. And this isn't corroborated, but if you tell your employees on Sunday the site is closing and less than a week later they get their severance and that's it, it seems to me like that is at least a potential indication of reactive, irrational and last minute decision making, if not a "tantrum."	labels:Yeah ngl, I am so completely disinterested in any form of feminism that's more aggrieved about one very wealthy woman being criticized with vaguely gendered language than it is about a whole bunch of financially precarious women on her staff having their livelihoods upended without warning in the middle of a pandemic winter. Who-owns-what-and-has-the-legal-right-to-lay-off-whom doesn't really factor into my moral reasoning either. If that makes me a crackpot, well, so are the people who actually wear these outfits in real life.
text:God, hear hear. Callous capitalist bullshit is despicable when it's done by and man and it's despicable when it's done by a woman. The brand was successful and there were a million ways to handle this that allows the writers at least a *fighting chance* of keeping their jobs. Honestly Manrepeller has always been like this: fun in a detached rich girl way, and this is probably the most appropriate way it could've ended.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:(Man) Repeller: A postmortem	labels:You can call her a despotic rich, white #girlboss if that fits your lens. The reality is it’s hers to do with what she chooses. Like many creatives,she was likely struggling with a loss of control due to the greed of others

text:Do you think that designer brands will no longer be as sought after in the future?	labels:Someone has to buy the designer firsthand for the secondhand market to have its inventory (and the brand itself to have cachet).

text:Do you think that designer brands will no longer be as sought after in the future?	labels:I think that we all collectively live in a bubble, and that, what we see and experience is not indicative of the world we actually live in. It’s easy to say that designer brands will no longer be as sought after in the future because of the current trend of buying secondhand, but, there are millions out there who are not doing that, and who are buying firsthand. Even buying designer secondhand is still making it desirable, so, no, I don’t think it will. I think that the sought after designers may change, but, I think designer items are always going to be super desirable.  Edit: a word.	episode_done:True
text:Do you think that designer brands will no longer be as sought after in the future?	labels:No. Like Borowitz said someone has to buy designer items in order for it to end up on the secondhand market.   There will always be a market for designer/luxury rtw, handbags, shoes & accessories as long as rich & wealthy people exist. The luxury market is not trying to appeal to everyone; they don't have to work hard to do so. I think that's reflected in FFA being repulsed by logos while not really being aware that for the most part LV, Balenciaga, & Gucci have been focusing on Asian markets and it worked.	episode_done:True
text:Do you think that designer brands will no longer be as sought after in the future?	labels:I don't get the logic.  Why would people be buying secondhand designer clothing if they didn't want designer clothing?  The pop in secondhand designer does not just *happen* to coincide with multiple major economic recessions and historically low relative wages for working class people.  At the same time we're in the shadow of a fast fashion industry that deliberately produces 'affordable' clothing of an extremely poor quality.  So, for a lot of us, the only way we can obtain good quality clothing is to buy it second-hand.  As for online platforms, I believe those only contribute to the popularity of designer clothing.  Since people can no longer handle clothing in person before we purchase it, we are even more reliant on brand reputation for a clue as to what the garment's quality might be.	episode_done:True

text:Article: Why Is Fashion So Beige This Season?	labels:The last time I remember noticing beige getting popular was around 2009 (the great recession).

Like, there's only so many ways you can wear a bright pink top, but you can generally wear neutrals with everything.  Anyhow, I've noticed color palettes are trending more neutral again and I took it as a sign that fashion folks are taking into account that during the pandemic customers are trying to stretch their buys as far as possible.

text:What’s your favorite winter fashion staple?	labels:I’m from Minnesota and I can relate to the winter fashion struggle lol. I’m a huge bargain hunter because I’m on that college student budget but I find winter outerwear to be one area where you mostly get what you pay for, although there are deals to be had. Layers are your best friend.  A pair of straight leg or mom jeans will probably leave you enough space to wear a pair of fleece lined leggings underneath to keep you toasty. Wool or cashmere sweaters in tight knits as opposed to more open weaves, with a tight long sleeve tshirt or long underwear shirt underneath. Riding boots with enough calf space to wear long wool socks underneath if you prefer skinny jeans/pants or dresses/skirts. I thrift a lot of this stuff or buy it at outlet stores (Nordstrom Rack, Marshall’s, etc).  A high-quality wool coat in a neutral color is definitely a worthwhile investment if you don’t like the look of down parkas. I got mine from a local outlet for $80 (90% off!) and it stands up really well to cold weather. I have a really good sized collection of winter accessories (hats, gloves, etc.) and I buy some cheap stuff in trendy colors/styles from Marshall’s once a year. I’m keeping an eye out for some faux leather gloves in a fun color for this year! That said, I think decent quality leather/faux leather gloves lined with a wool or cashmere blend and a hat and scarf in wool or cashmere are also good to have. They definitely keep me warmer than the cheap stuff. I have good luck at Sierra Trading Post (same company as Marshall’s/TJMaxx but focused on outdoorsy stuff) for that kind of thing.	episode_done:True
text:What’s your favorite winter fashion staple?	labels:Layering is essential! I swear by Uniqlo heattech as a base layer and then wool/cashmere sweaters. They aren't super bulky but keep you warm. Then a sleek wool coat (such as in camel, black, or grey) can make an outfit look put together along with a nice pair of boots (over the knee or knee high) and statement scarf!

text:What’s your favorite winter fashion staple?	labels:Mine is flannel so I might not be much help lol  But on a serious note - thin undershirts that are not cotton t shirts for when you don’t want to do the bulky layers thing. I have a silk weight “capilene” patagonia one for when it’s really super cold and I’ll be outside and some similar ones that tbh were army issued, so I’m sure you could find the same sort of thing without going to patagonia levels of expense. It’s kinda shocking how much warmth you get from them.   If I’m not anticipating being outdoors much, I’ve got an assortment of cuddlduds, thin modal tees off Amazon, and some bamboo ones. If I want to wear a lighter more fashionable blouse or thinner sweater or something I can put a layer underneath and still be warm without making my shirt too tight (and they are thinner/more snug/less spongy, as well as warmer, than a tee).  Edit - fixed and autocorrect that got by me	episode_done:True
text:What’s your favorite winter fashion staple?	labels:I found a wool midi skirt for $10 at a thrift store, and I *love* it. I feel fancy in it with an off the shoulder cashmere sweater, or comfy if I tuck a t-shirt into it. I also love Oxford heels in place of booties for a daintier look. Black tights, especially ones with subtle polka dot or other whimsical patterns, bring rompers and shorter skirts into the season. I also splurged a bit on a tailored tweed winter coat that makes me feel very put together and feminine.  I wear fleece leggings under everything; other leggings, jeans, skirts, bodysuit, doesn't matter.	episode_done:True
text:What’s your favorite winter fashion staple?	labels:Wool tights.   A good backpack that fits over your jacket or some other convenient bag that works well with your jacket open or closed. The bags I use the rest of the year usually end up being awkward during winter.   Substantial belts to cinch bulky dresses or long sweaters.   Slim-fitting turtlenecks. The right bra makes all the difference if you think turtlenecks don't work for you.	episode_done:True
text:What’s your favorite winter fashion staple?	labels:Lace trimmed camisoles under V neck sweaters, warm tights, and realizing that if you arent using public transportation you arent usually outside and trying to look cute for more than 5 minutes at a time. I stopped doing a lot of layering and just got a couple of coats for the various weather to put over things I like to wear inside. Being sweaty inside your coat is the worst.   Dressing to wait for the bus/train is a different story.
text:This! I’m not usually worrying about making my coat look cute with my outfit because I’m usually wearing my coat walking to and from my car and that’s it!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What’s your favorite winter fashion staple?	labels:A couple crew neck sweaters in neutral colours I can jazz up with a fashionable scarf. That way if it's warm, I can take the scarf off. Under them I wear tank tops.  I match up my warm scarf with my jackets. I have 2 wool coats which help but if it's below -20C I like to wear my ski jacket(s).  I prefer earmuffs to toques because of my hair and I have a black pair, a brown pair, a white pair and a pair that goes great with my favourite ski jacket.  I have 3 styles of winter boots:   \-low, very fashionable (leather and fake fur) and good long term until about -10C .. these I am likely to wear to go to the mall or whatnot   \-tall, very fashionable (wool) and good long term until about -10C .. these I wear rarely even though I love them, they're a pain because they make my legs really warm indoors but my feet get too cold outdoors   \-mid rise, mildly fashionable and good till -35C .. these are my everyday boots, running errands, off to work, shoveling snow etc  Fleece-lined tights for more a more casual look.  If I'm going to be able to stow my stuff and it's really cold (like -30C or colder) I'll wear fleece pants over my nice pants and take them off at my destination.	episode_done:True

text:Is anyone dressing up this year for Halloween?	labels:I am ashamed to admit that I forgot it was halloween today. We were invited to a Halloween party a few weeks ago and we declined and I haven’t thought of it much since. The local stores and boutiques near me haven’t done anything special for Halloween this year, just the fall display dragged on. I just got a coffee this morning and am sitting outside to read and just now realized that local coffee shop had no seasonal decor at all whatsoever! So unusual!  I’d best remember to put out a bowl of candy, but many of the places around here canceled trick or treating outright so I don’t have any prepared. You’ve inspired me to take a drive around today and look at some halloween decorations. I miss it! I think I will splurge for the full sized candy bars this afternoon and leave them outside. Give anyone here who IS trick or treating an extra treat!  Thank you ❤️
text:Hahahah I don't blame you. It feels like March 2092nd LOL     You are so right! I haven't seen many stores pushing Halloween stuff like they normally do. I put out some lights, in hopes of bringing some normalcy. Hopefully I will get some kiddos.     Hope you have a blast. I do that exact thing for Christmas. I make a big mug of hot chocolate, and me and my mom drive around looking at lights. So fun!!	labels:	episode_done:True

I bet they are all hurting too. Which really sucks.   Love that you are going to be in a comfy costume. I just found out that a few friends of mine are having a virtual Halloween party.

text:Favourite places to get your fall wool fix?	labels:Don’t forget to check out thrift stores. This is where I stock up on cashmere sweaters for a few dollars a piece, wool skirts, kilts, sweaters, vests, and cardigans, and amazing wool blazers and coats. I’ve found mint condition mohair and camel hair 3/4 coats for as low as $10, black cashmere sweaters for $2-3 and up, and cable knit pullovers for as low as $4. It’s amazing what people get rid of, not realizing how expensive it all is new. I also loooove wool in the fall and winter, and so this has been a super affordable way to build a dream cold-weather wardrobe.   The only thing wool I buy new are socks for the most part, everything else I’ve found at estate sales, garage sales, and thrift shops. When/if you go, definitely go through the boys and men’s departments, too. A bit of tailoring can make anything look custom like some of the pieces on Walker Slater maybe.

text:Yes! Second hand for sweaters all the way. I buy some sweaters from Poshmark. Because they can be so ageless, we can find pretty nice pieces from a few seasons ago, or even decades ago, and it'd still look current.   The only issue is old sweaters could have shrunk, look tired, or even felted, or come with holes. I returned two Poshmark pieces because they literally had undisclosed moth holes in them, lol.

text:Edit: I happened to go to a local Goodwill shortly after I posted this, and picked up a full length camel hair and cashmere coat for $6!!!  My best deal yet! I also picked up a beautiful and soft black wool cable knit turtleneck, and a green plaid wool skirt. Total came to $11 for the three.   One tip... I go early in the season for cashmere. Wool lasts fall to spring, and there’s generally not a lot of competition.  Most thrift stores don’t spend time reading the micro labels for fabric content (but they do the brand) so it’s quite easy to get a high quality but lesser known brand of cashmere for the same cost as acrylic.   If you run your hand lightly down the row, you’ll start to learn to ‘read’ the better fabrics by weight and thread count... it’s like Braille for me. I can tell silk from satin because natural fibers are slightly cooler than man made fabrics etc. Same with wool vs. acrylic, and leather vs vinyl. I run my hand down the rack and let the fabric and the temperature tell me what’s there. It’s even easier now with fast fashion because the thread count makes them a fraction of the weight of property made clothes, and they don’t have the same feel. This helps the really good stuff stand out quickly.  It also means I can hit a goodwill in about 15 minutes and have gone through almost all the racks!	labels:OMG your edit.

I also bought a pair while I was mourning immediately after her death. My husband made me go "hiking" at garden of the gods in Colorado springs and we stopped at a gift shop by one of the trailheads. They had these blue socks with sloths holding donuts with pink sprinkles. I fucking love sloths and pink sprinkle donuts and they're exactly the kind of thing she would have bought for me.  I have a few pairs of socks she gave me: baller sloths with gold chains. Otters holding hands. Sushi and sashimi. Silver glitter balloon animals. Some extremely tall ones covered in beer glasses.  I don't really like things touching my lower legs unless they're really soft or smooth. I guess the skin on my shins is super sensitive. So I mostly only wear ankle socks that don't really show, but I always make sure to buy cool ones. My favorites right now are pale pink with rhinos that say Party Animal.

I think it would be helpful to post the deals as soon as they’re announced by the retailers, which could be as early as next week.

text:WEEKLY DEALZ	labels:Re: Black Friday, I personally like having as much time as possible so I can research the item and sit on it before deciding to buy. It’s easy to make impulse purchases when the deals are hot.   The discounts will be big this year due to the decrease of retail sales and the increase of online shopping. I think it would be helpful to post the deals as soon as they’re announced by the retailers, which could be as early as next week.
text:I also think the discounts will be big this year but don't retailers often sell lower quality products for Black Friday?	labels:Sometimes, but only for certain items and merchants (e.g., Levi’s sold at Walmart vs. Levi’s.com). It’s more common to see inflated MSRPs to think you’re getting a good deal. If everyone knew retailers sold inferior products during BF, no one would shop then. That said, outlets and factory stores do sell lower quality items year round that were made specifically for them.   Stock photos that change right before sales can be another indicator that they’re selling a different version of the same item. All the more reason to have extra time to research your purchases.
text:I did not know this, so this is great advice. Are there more examples of retailers who do this?	labels:Electronics like TVs, computers, and appliances are known to have inferior BF counterparts. Cosmetics too, especially if they're sold in holiday kits. Not sure about clothing though; the Levi's were just an example I made up. I think it's more common among mass market/fast fashion retailers who have high turnover and can push out tons of product in a short amount of time. Think H&M, Forever 21, etc.  A good rule of thumb is that if it's too good to be true, it probably is. If you have to shop at all, go with stores that have generous return policies so you're not stuck with unwearable crap. A quick Google search pulls up lots of guides about what to avoid on BF, so that's a good place to start.
text:Nordstrom's anniversary sale is notorious for this - most of the clothes and shoes they sell special for the sale are lower quality than they would be otherwise.	labels:That’s a bummer, seeing as I purchased quite a few things during this year’s sale. Is it just their in-house brands or does it extend to other name brands too?   I bought some Nike tights that were discounted more than I’ve ever seen anywhere (including Nike’s website) so I suspect it’s the latter. They don’t feel too different than the ones I already own in other colors, but perhaps longevity will tell a different story.
text:I think most of the lower quality items are the items made for Nordstrom, like their Madewell items made exclusively for Nordstrom. If your Nike leggings are the same leggings sold by Nike on their website and feel similar to the ones you own then they're probably fine.	labels:Cool, thanks for the heads up. I try to buy directly from the brand whenever possible, but it’s easy to miss when a good deal is distracting.	episode_done:True
text:People who work in the fashion industry - what do you wear?	labels:I worked as a household assistant for a fashion designer and I agree- most her team (and the household staff) wore neutrals and very understated outfits. We all put more detail into making sure that everything looked nice (was clean, ironed, no pet hair, rolled or tucked in) and a lot of my co-workers would have pieces tailored- especially things like pants to ensure that they looked put together.	episode_done:True
text:People who work in the fashion industry - what do you wear?	labels:I work in the fashion industry, but within the tech org of a fashion retailer, which tends to be more casual than the rest of the company.   That being said, for being on the west coast (PNW), our tech org dresses much better when compared to the large tech companies in our area. Worth noting that with COVID and working from home, most people I work with are wearing solely athleisure now.   My role has to interact with our buyers and merchants quite a bit, so before COVID I tended to dress in smart-casual attire (think loafers, slacks, and a sweater — or nice jeans, a blazer to dress it up, and some booties).  Our merch org dresses all over the spectrum of “always fashionable” — where the lower employees tend to lean more casual and trendy, high-street fashion with maybe a few designer splashes, while upper management tends to wear a more business-formal designer wardrobe (think St. John style). Designer or not, people who work in the Merch org always seem to own their look and create a signature with it.	episode_done:True
text:People who work in the fashion industry - what do you wear?	labels:Like previous commenters stated, good understated neutrals with clean lines will go a long way to keep you looking polished!  I’d suggest one eye catching item per outfit to keep things fun and interesting, though (like statement pieces).	episode_done:True

text:People who work in the fashion industry - what do you wear?	labels:Congrats on the new job! I'm also working in Toronto, albeit as a production seamstress and studio assistant to a designer right now. I probably have some idea of which factory you might be working at! Since I'm carrying bolts of fabric up stairs, Laying out and cutting markers, as well as working with machinery I just keep it to simple skirts/dresses/turtlenecks that allow for ease of movement. I'm assuming you will be doing a lot of running around and trying to ensure everything's on schedule and things are organized so I would say comfort comes first. Maybe you can keep dressier shoes at your desk so you can wear sneakers while on the factory floor and change out of them if you have to meet clients. My friends who work in corporate offices for Toe Flesh and Canadian Water Fowl are able to get more dressed up because there's less risk of ruining your clothes at the office.	episode_done:True

I avoid clothes and accessories with prominent or all over logos on them.	episode_done:True
text:What designer bags and eras do you think will come back in fashion 2021-2022?	labels:In terms of fashion, I think colors and maximalism will come back, after an entire decade of minimalism.   I was watching Twin Peaks, and what amazed me about the 80s 90s fashion in that show is the vibrancy of colors and patterns. We are already immersed in 80s and 90s revival now, esp in terms of oversized and dramatic fits, and I think gradually crazier colors and patterns will become more mainstream.   Bags - I suppose the more dramatic the better, and we are already seeing crazy shapes and colors now. Celine might start with crazier designs as well, with Slimane at its helm.
text:I think so too. The mom-jeans on trend is often more 80s then 90s. And I've seen shoulder pads, and shoulder "wings" comming in.  I hope for a V silhouette. Possible updated for curvier ideal compared to the slim 80's aerobics girl.  I like it, but I realized my nice winter coats does NOT go with acid wash jeans.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:What designer bags and eras do you think will come back in fashion 2021-2022?	labels:I think bags with a lot of hardware and buckles will come back. Mulberry is relaunching the Alexa tomorrow and I suspect a little bit of a comeback of big slouchy casual bags like the Alexa, the Balenciaga City and some of the hardware-heavy (literally) Chloe designs.  Small shoulder bags, Prada Nylon, the Fendi Baguette and the Dior Saddle won‘t be going anywhere.  If anything, I fear that Nylon bags are coming back with a vengeance... bags with lots of pockets, compartments... those ridiculous prada boots with the little pouches are just the beginning.
text:While I love the maximalist style...this is definitely the part I really didn't love. The Uber casual and slouchy look was something I didn't even like when it was in style before (insert sweater boots)	labels:I definitely prefer a middle ground between slouchy and structured for practicality alone. And I never look cute and casual with slouchy bags either.   It might be fun to hunt for a nice vintage bag that fits this style but with the current designer prices, I won‘t be participating in that trend 😅	episode_done:True

text:Can we make a thread of everyone posting their all time favorite Halloween costume they wore? 🎃👻	labels:Halloween was forecast to be cold one year when I was in elementary school. I wasn’t “fashionable” unless you count tshirt dresses with mismatched patterned tights “fashionable,” but I did want to wear a costume without getting cold.

I had a dress covered in stars, did my hair up in an elaborate crown studded with crystal stars and moons, black knee-high boots, and -for the most dramatic "look" - I sewed three sets of blue and white string lights into a black cloak so that I wore a cape of stars. Also I covered myself in glitter! The battery pack made dancing difficult but it was so worth it haha. The party had a woodland-gods-and-mystical-creatures theme so there's a picture of me at some point sitting on a massive throne and it's probably the most regal I've ever felt in my life	episode_done:True

text:Can we make a thread of everyone posting their all time favorite Halloween costume they wore? 🎃👻	labels:I love doing elaborate costumes from things I already have... I'm a bit of a hoarder so I actually have a lot of options! My last few costumes were Wednesday Addams, Holly Golightly, a witch, a pirate (2x), Old Gregg, and Jake (with Finn from Adventure Time). I only had to shop for the last two, buying a white necktie for Old Gregg and yellow shorts and shirt for Jake (because yellow is the ONE color I never wear).   I was looking forward to this Halloween for the last few years because it would finally be on a Saturday... I was thinking of going as Dorothy, as a German girl (I have a few dirndls), or as Cinderella and Belle with a friend (I have gowns and long gloves for both). Fingers crossed for next year!	episode_done:True

text:Does anyone else wear one brand only?	labels:God, no. I enjoy shopping and the thrill of finding something new. I enjoy shopping from brands that have different aesthetics. I also switch around based on quality, fit, and price.   I have a question, though... Your username is BlueWaistcoat. Do you actually have a blue waist coat? Is it a blazer or like a track jacket? How do you manage workwear? No job I've ever had would have allowed me to go to work in Adidas every day. Well, maybe one employer, but I don't think it would have conveyed the right level of professionalism. And what do you wear for special occasions, like weddings and funerals?  Is there a line of Adidas that I am overlooking? I am only familiar with their athletic and athleisure clothing.
text:Hahaha so many questions 🤣 such few answers haha   I don't own a blue waistcoat but I have a tattoo of my cat wearing a blue waistcoat riding a bicycle like an English gentleman... So that's where my username comes from.  I did get in trouble with work when I first started wearing tracksuits to work... So I dug deeper into the employee handbook and found that they have a stupid policy whereby joggers aren't allowed but leggings are 🙄 so I just wear Adidas leggings with an Adidas hoodie/sweatshirt/t-shirt to work.  Although I've been working from home since March, and hopefully I'll never have to go back into the office and I can comfortably live the rest of my days wearing joggers.  I hate social gatherings, and have only ever attended one wedding in my entire life. I even missed my brother's wedding earlier this year. I've never attended a funeral, but if it comes to it then I have an all black Adidas tracksuit ready to go.  So yeah... I don't think wearing all Adidas would work for everyone.

text:Does anyone else wear one brand only?	labels:I only wear Uniqlo. I became obsessed with the brand when when I lived in Seoul 2007-2009 and it's just kinda followed me since. I move a lot between continents and they always end up having an online shop or a location a few hours' drive away, so off I go when possible. It's often one of the few constants that I get to keep when everything else changes.

text:Does anyone else wear one brand only?	labels:I realized recently when I put all my clothes in an app (called StyleBook) and looked at statistics that a disproportionate amount of my things are J. Crew. I didn't try, it just... happened. There's basically a J. Crew item in every outfit I wear. But my style is preppy and classic, lots of interchangeable basics too, and J. Crew fits that idea perfectly so it isn't too surprising!
text:How do you like that app?  I was considering it, but it seemed like a pretty sizable time commitment up front. Does it help you with new ideas?	labels:I really like it! 100 percent recommend.  You are correct in that it does take a lot of time. It took me a couple of days to take pictures (or find them online) and upload everything I owned. However I tracked everything including my belts, scarves etc so if you just want to do major pieces (dresses, pants, shirts, shoes) it will probably take less time. I also make sure I catalog new things as soon as I get them so I don't fall behind.  It has been very worth it! It even has a really cool feature that mixes up random outfits from your stuff and I have found a few combos I would never have thought of from that. It is definitely worth at least trying!

text:Does anyone else wear one brand only?	labels:I felt that way about lululemon when I took the plunge last January and bought my first pair of leggings. About 50 lululemon pieces later (and lots of money spent) I don't really feel the urge to add new items to my lululemon collection.  Lululemon is best for lounging or going to the gym so lately I've been more focused on buying cool clothes I can wear to work. I have been buying a lot of aritzia, zara, and h&m to fill the office clothes void though.	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone else wear one brand only?	labels:About 80% of my wardrobe is Eileen Fisher---partly because I still pick up occasional shifts from the store and I get a discount there and "first dibs" on returns and sale items.

I like dressing up and never owned any lounge clothes that I wore outside of bedtime, and when quarantine hit I had a mini identity crisis wondering "where the fuck do I wear all these nice clothes???

text:Same here. I work as a high school teacher and decided to dress the way I want rather than the way I should, as long as it stays appropriate, even if I'll be teaching in jeans, sneakers and a metal band t-shirt. I do pay attention to the state of my clothes, the fit and what kind of print there will be on the t-shirt though. That allows me to stand out from the students.

text:When to start saving clothes for your children?	labels:When to start saving clothes for your children?   Never. You don't know:   1. If you'll have children 2. If you'll have a girl or and trans child who would find it appropriate to wear your clothes 3. If they'll even have the same fashion sense as you 4. If they will be the same size as you 5. If your clothes will hold up to the ravages of time   I come from a family of hoarders. I have some hoarding tendencies of my own which I'm dealing with. I'm also in the midst of cleaning out my mum's home after she died almost 2 years ago. I go over every weekend and spend a few hours clearing out her stuff. I've been doing this for going on 18 months. I've spent hundreds of dollars trucking stuff to the dump. I learned the hard way that it's not worth holding onto stuff, *just in case*.  My mother held onto every piece of baby clothing and toddler and children's and a lot of teen clothing I wore. And all of her clothes. And all of my grandmother's clothes. And all of my brothers and sisters and father's clothes. And some of her sister's stuff, too. And you know what it looks like now? Most of it has disintegrated, some chewed up by mice, others damaged by moths, and a lot damaged by mold. Anything that hasn't been destroyed by time has gone to charity. I love my mother, and I have memories from my mother, I don't need her moth-eaten, moldy, brittle leather jacket from 50 years ago. And neither do your kids. Give your stuff away to charity to people who need it now, and don't leave behind boxes of crap for your kids to have to deal with after you're dead. Cleaning out my mother's home is teaching me to be a minimalist.    Put money aside, and use it to buy things your child actually wants. And donate your unwanted clothes to charity to people who need it now.   e: don't even get me started on toys, old school work, books, records, VHS tapes...    e: This is coming from a 41 year old who never had kids (even though she always thought she would).

text:Fair enough. With Asian weddings there are often multiple events and clothes are so expensive that no one in my family has gotten rid of them. Also, Pakistani clothes are pretty much always tailored so they're bespoke too.

Western dresses can be tailored too but it didn’t need much tailoring to fit me, I just didn’t like the styles or fabric at all. Super Shiny Satin TM was very in-in the late 80s😅

It's a little tedious, seeing as you will be hauling around a box for years, but if you take the approach of a museum curator, the old pieces can resemble pictures in a photo album, as opposed to clothing to be worn.

text:When to start saving clothes for your children?	labels:My Mum saved some of her clothing for me. I really cherish the pieces she gave me. My favourite is a black velvet dress she wore a lot in her mid twenties. She also saved some of my nicest baby clothes, so I could use them with my future daughters.  Almost all the items that she saved were high quality velvet, lace and silk. They also were in solid colors.   In most instances it was items she didn't fit in anymore but had an emotional attachment to, so they stayed in the back of her closet until I hit my late teens. She made most of the items, a couple were purchased, and some were made for her. Since she has a talent for sewing and repair, all the items were kept in top condition. She didn't give me all the pieces at once. She would offer to lend me a dress for an event, and I'd try it on. Then she would tell me the story behind it, and say it was mine if I wanted it.   I have wool coats and leather jackets that I'm using currently, but will put away for future generations when they don't fit anymore or I change up my style. After an unfortunate pen in the laundry mishap I've also considered purchasing doubles of items I really enjoy. If something happens I'll have a spare. If nothing does I'll have a vintage-with-tags gift for future children ☺️ purchasing items specifically for future generations seems a bit high pressure though..  My Mum also saved shoes and boots for me but our shoe size is different so that didn't work out unfortunately.   My husband (at 30yo) is saving some clothes he felt he had grown out of for any future sons we may have. It's stored in the attic.   Solid pieces in quality materials that are cared for and stored properly are likely to be received well. I'm thankful my Mum saved her best clothing over the years for me. Obviously saving every ragged Walmart t shirt is going to become a case of hoarding like other posters mentioned. But if it's a reasonable amount of high quality pieces and you have storage space then why not? It's family heirlooms and history.	episode_done:True

My mom was quite interested in fashion as well, and she routinely tells me my thrift store finds look like pieces she owned in the 90’s. We moved across the country when I was young so holding on to them wasn’t really an option. I do have some pieces I don’t ever plan on selling and just holding on to as a time capsule or memory; a few political/ charity sweaters, my first Chanel earrings, the Marc Jacobs sneakers I spent 6 years looking for, a pair of bell bottoms from the 70’s with Coca Cola logos all over them....

text:I'm also curious if there are any items that stick out that you got or swapped!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Have you ever participated in a clothing swap - in person or online?	labels:I’m using swopped (UK version of Swap Society) and it’s good if you can’t sell your clothing or you don’t want to donate to charity (as it may end up in land fill). The items you send in gets assessed to see whether it’s in fit condition to swap. I’ve tried to do direct swapping on Depop but it’s hard to just find people who have similar tastes to your style or just the imbalance value of clothing offered. It’s a great way to get new clothes if you don’t want to spend money neither.	episode_done:True
text:Have you ever participated in a clothing swap - in person or online?	labels:I actually went to a swap last weekend! We did it outside in a yard.  The host had hung up clothes lines between a bunch of trees and when we arrived, we put our stuff on the lines.  That way everything could be displayed, but we could also wander around while maintaining some distance.  Where I'm from, at the end of the swap, the host donates the left over clothes to a women's shelter.  I've gotten some hits and misses from swaps, but overall it's fun.   It helps if the host invites people who are similar sizes or makes sure to invite lots of people with a variety of body types so no one is really left out.
text:I really like that outdoor format.  Did you bring anything home?	labels:Yeah! A Hawaiian shirt, pajama bottoms, a hat with a marmot on it, a fleece, a t shirt from the arizona sonoran desert museum, and an REI shirt for my man.  It wasn't a very "high fashion" swap haha
text:Nice!  With the exception of the Eileen Fisher sweater my scores haven't been high end either but several have been workhorses.   I remember I got 2 pairs of pretty decent skinny jeans, a workout tank, an olive H&M blouse that was work appropriate when I needed more, and a pair of black cropped pajama pants covered in tacky martini glasses that I adore.  I also got some guitar tab books and several novels, and a work mug.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Have you ever participated in a clothing swap - in person or online?	labels:Pre-Covid, I went to several clothing swaps hosted by a friend of a friend. The clothing swap would be at a bar in the area, you could get drinks (friend of friend is a bar tender) and go through the clothing on the tables. You could choose to drop off clothes and take nothing, you could choose to give away nothing and take stuff and anything else in-between. Most people came with stuff and left with different items. Everything left over at the end of the night was donated.   I LOVED going to these swaps. I got so many awesome things and it was a great way to give away things that I was no longer interested in wearing.
text:I've been to usually smaller swaps where everyone had to bring something to take, and bigger swaps where you you didnt have to.  I'm usually almost more grateful for the opportunity to get rid of stuff constructively than I am for taking stuff, though the taking is the fun part.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Have you ever participated in a clothing swap - in person or online?	labels:I used to do clothing swaps in college and in the first years post-college when lots of my friends lived nearby. We always had tons of fun! We were all roughly similar sizes but many different heights, styles, and budgets. Whatever wasn’t claimed at the end of the party was donated. It was always exciting when something fit someone else better than the original owner. I still have several pieces from those swaps.   Now that we’ve scattered across the country, I haven’t done a big swap in a while but when I’m cleaning out my closet, I do occasionally set aside an item or two that I know a friend would love or look great in. I know a few things have even been handed down to friends of friends - especially a lot of first office job clothes I bought at H&M that have made their way through 3 or 4 people now.	episode_done:True
text:Have you ever participated in a clothing swap - in person or online?	labels:Since I’m in college, pre-pandemic I would go to swaps put on by the sierra club or the fashion magazine. I have a few things I really like from these swaps, and I thought they were fun. It helped that they were pretty large events with lots of people. I think it would have been more difficult for people outside of straight sizes though.	episode_done:True
text:Have you ever participated in a clothing swap - in person or online?	labels:Just a Facebook group of friends where we sell each other used clothes.	episode_done:True
text:Have you ever participated in a clothing swap - in person or online?	labels:I have participated in one.  It was a long time ago but I remember it being super helpful.  There were clothes for everyone there, not just women, so I stocked up on mostly kids' clothes.  I did, however, bring home a fantastic vintage houndstooth wool dress coat that I still wear.  It's one of my favorite pieces in my wardrobe.    I would love to do another one but right now doesn't feel very safe for something like that.	episode_done:True
text:Have you ever participated in a clothing swap - in person or online?	labels:I went to a swap earlier this year and it was great! They would divide clothes between high street (eg. H&M, Zara etc.) and high end (designer, high quality vintage) and each garment awarded you a token for the category it was sorted in. I paid £5 entry and came away with a Temperley skirt with a boat print that I am planning on getting tailored (waist is a smidge too big).  ETA. This was organised by a sewing cooperative so was more formal than just having friends over.	episode_done:True
text:How has your style grown/changed since before quarantine?	labels:I have been able to really hone in on my style! It’s not that it has changed, it’s just that I’ve been able to buy things that are more in-line with it. Actually, the trends this year of ruffles, bows and puffy peeves are my actual style, so, I’m advantage of having all of my favorite things being readily accessible.	episode_done:True
text:How has your style grown/changed since before quarantine?	labels:More color, dressier, heels every day. The office is the only place I'm around people these days.

text:How has your style grown/changed since before quarantine?	labels:I've discovered the world of online thrifting/secondhand shopping during quarantine and it's proved to be both a blessing and a curse. A blessing because I get to lean into my vintage-inspired aesthetics a lot more and have more fun with my style, and a curse because my wallet and my storage are suffering! But I'm lucky in that the pandemic in our country is under control and I still get to go to work and go out, so I can put my newly-acquired wardrobe to good use.	episode_done:True

text:How has your style grown/changed since before quarantine?	labels:I’ve been through so many different phases. In the beginning, I was used to dressing business casual for work and had very little loungewear since I usually just sleep in a big t-shirt or fleece pajamas. For the first few months, I still did a full face of makeup everyday and wore a dress or a skirt just to work remotely. I also was obsessed with The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel during this time lol so I was always dressed in feminine florals, bouncy curls, and bright red lipstick.   However, since then I’ve somehow become more of a pants person? I used to exclusively wear dresses and skirts every day but now I find comfort in a good paperbag pant or soft lived in jeans. I also have gradually dulled my previously pastel color scheme into a few neutral pieces that all go together. My wardrobe has definitely become more practical and comfortable and honestly it’s hard to see myself going back to my old ways.	episode_done:True
text:How has your style grown/changed since before quarantine?	labels:Months of not being seen by anyone has helped me become more confident in whatever I want to wear - regardless of what anyone thinks. I stopped thinking "what will so-and-so be wearing" or "will I look too dressed \[up/down\]" and started wearing what I actually felt like. That has spilled over into the "not lockdown" part of my life and I feel amazing, because I broke a bad cycle of caring what anyone thinks. Because of this, I feel like I've finally figured out what my style is.	episode_done:True
text:How has your style grown/changed since before quarantine?	labels:I used to have a very professional business casual + academic style pre covid (i'm a college student in a big city, for ref.). That means, a lot of low heels, blazers, suit-like pants, editorial look. Now, I'm actually dressing more my age as opposed to for a future career: oversize, bright & colorful pieces, interesting necklines and clashing prints. Honestly, it's been a big 180\` and I kinda love it tbh. What's more fun is on days when i feel like dressing up, I combine the two styles and look very ManRepeller circa 2018, or Kdrama fashion. It's amazing!

text:Work is the only place I go, too. I’ve gotten a little experimental in my work clothes. For example, today I look like what would happen if the staff at Rick Owens got laid off and had to tone it down and work office temp jobs. It’s definitely edgier than what I’d usually wear, but definitely not inappropriate. I’m digging it.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How has your style grown/changed since before quarantine?	labels:I have a lot of “casual Friday” and more casual items that I didn’t wear much because I wore workwear four days a week, but we are back to the office and somehow our dress code has unofficially relaxed. Our higher-ups and clients are based in bigger cities and don’t come to see us anymore. 😊 It has allowed me to wear some of my more casual pieces more often, to work. My favourite new “work appropriate” pieces are leather leggings, dark jeans, and my corduroy miniskirt (with tights). Most bottoms.	episode_done:True

text:When your personality and aesthetic don't quite match?	labels:Sounds like there's a problem with your bf, not your style.
text:Plus there are SO MANY MEN who know absolutely nothing about fashion or style. If he doesn’t even know the right terminology to use then he probably falls in this group.   It’s possible the boyfriend has an art school education, or participates in online fashion forums, or is very tapped into visual style (if so, he still could keep his opinions to himself)... but I’m betting it’s more likely he wears too much hair gel and the same crumpled t shirt and jeans most of the time. Which is also fine, but doesn’t make him qualified to comment on anyone else’s fashion choices.  OP, if you feel comfortable in it, go ahead and wear it. You’ll work out what you like, and it’ll probably evolve over the years. If you’re looking for more ideas, try searching tags on Instagram and pinning outfits online to refer back to.	labels:When an ex of mine (well-meaning but very much a bro) would make any remark about women's fashion, I'd just give him a look and say, "Yeah, ok, Mr Versace..." and that would shut that shit right down.	episode_done:True

Oh, to have the confidence and life wisdom of a 24-year-old man.  There's nothing inherently wrong with sharing/asking for your partner's opinion about your style or wanting them to like how you dress, but it has to be something that you've both agreed you enjoy, not just one person offering unsolicited opinions.

text:This. A few years ago I ran into a guy I knew from high school at a party and he drunkenly told me that everyone was always wondering what my body looked like because I wore so many layers that no one could tell.

text:When your personality and aesthetic don't quite match?	labels:I’m going to echo what others have said - this is *his* problem, not yours. It seems like to some extent he’s expressing that he knows what your “true style” is better than you - when more likely it’s just about what he likes best. I’m going to apply the benefit of the doubt here too... but I think you need to express to him that you’re happy with how you dress.  My partner once said early on that I dressed too colorfully for the area where we live - I was pretty firm that I was happy with how I dress and it’s never come up since then. In the past few years he’s even come to encourage my habits.   It’s someone reflecting their feelings on to you - hopefully when you let them know you don’t feel the same way, they’ll understand and their point of view will change. If it doesn’t, it’s probably not a good sign.	episode_done:True

They've been on the chopping block for years, though. Not at all surprising they've collapsed now.  The number of different pieces they produced always seemed crazy to me.

text:Help needed for buying jeans online! All advice is welcome!	labels:Pay attention to the product details section to see if the jeans have any stretch.

text:Help needed for buying jeans online! All advice is welcome!	labels:1. check the material content. If you're looking for the thicker, heavy duty jean with no stretch look, always look at "materials and care" to check fabric content. You want it to be 100% cotton. Cheap options: Zara, H&M, Banana Republic (on sale) and more pricey: Levi's & everlane 2. For skinny jeans you probably want some with some stretch I think 90-95% cotton? (same retailers as above) 3. ALWAYS check to see what shipping/return policy is by digging around the website. Most retailers will offer free shipping over $50 which you can easily hit when buying jeans. ALWAYS!!! check what the return options are. Some will say "free returns" but the fine print will read "but return shipping will be deducted from your refund" If you don't hit the free shipping requirement just buy something you know you're going to return.  4. don't be afraid to buy sizes below and above your normal size! The more you buy the more you'll become familiar with different brands, their fit, and sizing!	episode_done:True

I don’t have any tips, but I am sending good vibes your way.  ETA: I guess if I do have a tip; it’s to go with your gut. Had I gone with my gut, I would have wouldn’t have listen to the calculator and it’s stupid “70% of people” got a size X and “30% got Y.” I went with the X even though my initial instinct was to go with Y.

text:How to avoid looking older with your clothing??	labels:I honestly wouldn’t worry about it that much. I remember trying the whole “hipster glasses/ugly christmas sweater” aesthetic when I was in middle school and being paranoid that I would look like a grandma— but when I look back at those photos I just look like a typical baby-faced teen.   If you’re that worried about it, I would maybe throw some trendier pieces like doc martens or dark academia-esque plaid tennis skirts in the mix, since those tend to read young and seem very “in” right now.	episode_done:True
text:How to avoid looking older with your clothing??	labels:Just dropping in to say that I find it funny that a 14 year old is afraid of looking older than their actual age. When I was 14, all I wanted to do was to look like a college freshman. People look down their noses at teenagers, (especially teenage girls) and so I tried to fake maturity and experience, because I thought it would be beneficial to me. But then again! I only enjoyed my early twenties for a few blissful years, after which I discovered that I should apparently be grateful for stuff like getting carded (ohmygawd you guys, I'm so happy this stranger thinks I look too young to be legally drinking!!). So I actually get that someone would panic at 14 years of age, if they were aware of the small window of time in which women are allowed to feel satisfied with their looks.   However, there's no way someone is going to mistake you for being in your 20's just because you're dressing "old". You could dress like a truly old woman complete with all the muted/pastel colors, curly short hair, and kitten heels you desire - people would just think you have alternative style.   The reason some people worry about dressing old, is because once you hit your mid-20's, people start aging at much different rates than they did before. So, 35 year old woman could be mistaken as someone in their early 40's who just looks good for their age, because of styling alone. But you are way too young to be worrying about this.   And dark academia isn't even an old-ish style - it reads as slightly naive (mostly in a good way) to most people who actually went to university. In fact this look has more to do with private schools than uni.	episode_done:True
text:How to avoid looking older with your clothing??	labels:Don't worry! You're most likely not going to look any older. Clothes do much less for your age than you think. Just imagine a middle aged lady that dresses like a teenager. She's not fooling anyone. If dressing like another age worked to look another age, we would all do it 😂 just enjoy clothes and experiment with fun looks, it's easy to pull most things off while young.	episode_done:True
text:How to avoid looking older with your clothing??	labels:Dark academia actually has a lot of youthful styles from it's boarding school influences. You'll see a lot of school uniform looks, plaid skirts, blazers, jumpers, mary janes, blouses and pinafores. You can get inspiration from children and teens in movies set in the early 1900's.

text:How to avoid looking older with your clothing??	labels:I think everyone looks back on their teenage years as being super cringy... not because of our style but because the fashion itself from 10, 15 or 20 years ago *can seem* really awful when we look back. 20 years ago, I was 15. I look at what teenagers wear today and I'm like "damn.... I wish I'd had that sense of style." But I did, just in my time. We wore what we wore back then because it was a great way to help us explore, create, and share our identities in the sense of a larger concept of style. But those styles change, evolve, come back around, and disappear again over time. I think I looked ridiculous when I was 15, but back then, I was cool as hell!  Honor your own sense of style and what makes you feel comfortable, happy, and the most authentic expression of who you are. Those may all change over time, but enjoy the moment you're in.  I also had a big vintage clothing phase when I was around your age and perhaps my favorite thing was hitting the local thrift store and altering my finds to fit my size and style. My senior prom dress was actually 3 vintage gowns that I'd found and spliced together. Even today I would say that about a third of my wardrobe is vintage and thrift. The best way to wear vintage and thrift I would say is to learn how to make little alterations like hemming, changing buttons, adding or removing darts, or dyeing. I loved making things my own in simple, little ways.	episode_done:True
text:How to avoid looking older with your clothing??	labels:Screw whatever everyone thinks and just roll with it. I wish that I learned this when I was 14, but I guess 16 isn’t too late either. Now at 18, I can wear basically anything I want from dark academia to cottagecore, to grunge to anything else in between. I’m happier than I ever was.	episode_done:True
text:How to avoid looking older with your clothing??	labels:I looove this aesthetic, it's my actual workwear, and funnily enough I dress this way because it does make me look older.  To stay age appropriate, the key is accessories. Socks that fit the aesthetic but are more playful, bows are great, and fun jewelry. There are so many looks, like plaid skirts, that I like but would never wear because they're better for a younger look. Also, if you don't already look older than your age it's probably not going to be a problem. If it does have that effect, it's not in an inappropriate way so it really doesn't matter.	episode_done:True
text:How to avoid looking older with your clothing??	labels:If you are seriously worried about looking older, just get a few pieces that together have a dark academia vibe, but you can mix in with your other clothes.	episode_done:True

text:Stockings vs Tights vs Leggings	labels:I wear leggings, tights always run from rubbing against my boots but at least with leggings I can just shave the pills off.

The bathroom situation is kinda annoying but I'd have to do that anyway if I wore pants.	episode_done:True

text:Stockings vs Tights vs Leggings	labels:I’m mainly a tights person, especially thicker ones.

Like, I’ve been basically living in a pair of Black Milk toasties leggings this entire fall (since I want to be both warm and colourful and that’s hard when it’s cold haha).  For keeping them up I have a pair of those little spandex shorts meant to shape the butt and tummy, but I wear them outside the tights. Also keeps the tights from wearing out in the crotch, bonus!	episode_done:True

text:Where do you get good quality, legit wool sweaters that won't rip/shrink after washing?	labels:I haven't washed my new wool sweaters yet but I handwashed the armpits of one sweater using woolite and it worked really well.

text:Where do you get good quality, legit wool sweaters that won't rip/shrink after washing?	labels:Here in NZ we have fine spun Merino wool jerseys (as we call them) that can be machine washed without shrinking. Reason being that the wool is pre- shrunk at the plant before they knit them up.  I went on a tour of a plant some years ago and it was super interesting.   anyway having said that i always hand wash my wool jerseys.   The thing that shrinks them in the machine, or if washed wrong is not the hot water but the agitation . This stretches the fibres out and then they bounce back even tighter, if that makes sense.   So even when hand washing you don't want to agitate or rough them up much, just soak, then squeeze gently.  No spin drying natch.    i did find a merino fine wool jumper on ASOS a while ago, it was mens but a pretty coral pink.	episode_done:True

text:Thank you, they have some really cute patterns right now	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Where do you get good quality, legit wool sweaters that won't rip/shrink after washing?	labels:My woolllies are Benetton's. Most of them came from Italy and they are 100% wool, sometimes mixed (a bit of cashmere, angora). I have a couple from NZ - these are 100% merino and not Benetton's. I also have a few handamde so they don't count here.  They are old, though - or vintage.  Apart from my Kiwi jumpers, as said here alteady, which can be machine washed (but in cold water, delicate cycle and inside a mesh bag), you cannot wash them in the washing machine. They may not rip if inside a laundry bag, but they will certainly felt. Somebody told me the spin cycle is what destroys them, but my machine spins while rinsing as well, so it's a no-no anyway.   Using Woolite is enough to make them last for many years. Good quality wool jumpers will last a very long time if well cared for.  Having said that, I must confess I absolutely loathe washing anything by hand. So my woollies don't get worn a lot anymore....  They are > 10 yrs old btw  Good luck!!	episode_done:True

text:Kind working off of this premise, my mother always emphasized that a expensive designer purchase should be attached to a goal or important milestone. Ever since high-school I wanted a designer bag, and as soon as it become possible for me to buy one with my own money I had a goal in mind. I had been worked as a contracted worker for 2 years and was aiming to get a stable full time job.

text:How much of your income do you spend on average in clothes every month?	labels:It’s different for me now that I’m in my 30s and working full time. I’d guess around 10% of my salary (after taxes) averaged out... like some months I spend a lot more, others I don’t buy anything.   Back when I was in college, I did a lot of thrifting and shopping clearance racks! I still like second hand shopping and getting a good deal,  but now saving up for high quality items feels a lot more feasible.  Back in college when I really could only expect tiny amounts of money left over from my income after I paid my bills, it was much more fun to buy a pair of crazy leggings for $5 off the target clearance rack then to try to save up for something nice.  I also feel like I thought of shopping as a fun activity! It was much cheaper to go to the thrift store with my BFFs and get a fun/weird new outfit than to go for dinner and a movie.	episode_done:True
text:How much of your income do you spend on average in clothes every month?	labels:I probably spend on average $150-$200 a month on clothes (that includes workout stuff, loungewear lately, undergarments, etc.). That’s maybe 2-3% of my take home income. I’m probably a bit older than you though.   Honestly in college/post college I almost never shopped because I was so broke, which lead me to going a bit crazy once I did have disposable income.   I kind of think of clothes shopping in terms of “needs” and “wants,” but it sounds like new clothes aren’t really either for you right now. If that’s the case, don’t buy just to buy - keep spending your money on the things that make you happy.	episode_done:True
text:How much of your income do you spend on average in clothes every month?	labels:This... is not actually a problem.  You should have a certain amount of your what you make set aside for fun stuff (which should depend on your lifestyle and financial situation) and if you prioritize social activities and saving over clothing, there's nothing wrong with that.  Chances are that your friends are finding good deals because some of their leisure time is dedicated that, whether in person are online, so if that's not something you enjoy, you do you.  With the way things are going, in a few months time, you'll probably be thankful to have some money saved up.  Personally, I live in an area where, if you enjoy cooking and don't drink, shopping constitutes as going out, which means my discretionary income is mainly going to clothes.  I've been rebuilding my closet and the *most* I've spent in a month is $90 which... actually equated to a horrifying amount of, mostly thrifted, stuff (which was fortunate, since I axed most my spring/summer wardrobe and went for it about a week before lockdown.)  I do have years where I don't really buy clothes and that money will instead go to games, or uncommon ingredients, or art supplies, or going out.	episode_done:True
text:How much of your income do you spend on average in clothes every month?	labels:I spend about 3-4% (~$250/month) of my take home income on clothes. It would probably be around 7-8% if handbags and shoes were included.   I’m in my late 20s and fortune enough to be making a pretty good income. It’s totally normal to be spending a lot less when you’re in college! Some students have parental help with finances or spend their money from part time work on clothes. Don’t feel pressured to spend money on clothes when you have other priorities that come first (like school, rent, food, savings).	episode_done:True
text:How much of your income do you spend on average in clothes every month?	labels:I'm probably somewhere in $300-$400 per month territory once it's averaged out. I tend to mostly shop during the end of season sales so my spending is heavily weighted in January and June. I'm in my 30's though, so don't feel bad about barely buying clothes, at your age I think experiences are a much better spend. Were I not in the financial position I'm in, clothing would be a fairly low priority item.	episode_done:True
text:How much of your income do you spend on average in clothes every month?	labels:When I was a student, I did buy quite a lot of fast fashion (e.g. Primark) and high street items, particularly when there was a good sale on. I enjoyed it and was exploring my style, and it was all balanced by not spending as much on nights out, drinking and takeaways.  Once I started working, I divided up my money into buckets: monthly fun money (£100) that can roll up, monthly luxury savings money (£100) that would accumulate until I could afford the £££ item I wanted, monthly travel/experience money budget that would also accumulate, general bills and the rest into savings. Ultimately these numbers are arbitrary and was the way that allowed me to splurge sensibly whilst saving, guilt free.   Remember that you can always earn more money so don't be too hard on yourself, but also learn how to be fiscally responsible! It's a balance and learning experience for sure, and will change as life happens (*cough* Covid *cough*).	episode_done:True
text:How much of your income do you spend on average in clothes every month?	labels:If you live in a city- go thrifting! I used to think of thrift stores as places to find like weird old vintage looks, but that’s not true. I go all the time and get things like Equipment, Anthropologie, Paige Jeans, Vince, etc. I even found a pair of excellent condition Rothys the other day! All for like $3-$10. You can have a rotating wardrobe fairly affordably. Also, utilize places like Clothes Mentor and Plato’s Closet if you can, not only to buy from them but to sell as well. I buy stuff at the thrift store for a few dollars, wear it a few times or a season, then resell it to ClothesM or PlatosC. You end up wearing it for free basically.   I also use Rent The Runway. For $89 a month you get to rent 4 items. They carry a huge selection of designer clothing; it’s a fun way to try statement pieces and things you otherwise couldn’t afford. For example, I currently on my rental this month have a $745 Derek Lam coat, a $325 pair of Rag & Bone wool pants, a $395 Current/Elliot cardigan, and a $250 Equipment sweater.	episode_done:True
text:How much of your income do you spend on average in clothes every month?	labels:On a good month I have £120. This is to be split on everything that's not groceries & basic household consumables, healthcare, rent or bills. So it's spent on going out, clothes, skincare, stuff for the house that's not consumables, presents, etc. I would spend £100-£200 on a new item of clothing, less on second-hand. So as you might guess, I don't buy a lot of clothes! What I buy I wear until THE END.   Edit: I should mention that I work part-time so I would spend less than an average person. It's a trade off - more time, less golds.	episode_done:True

text:Hair accessories - professional or should be saved for casual environments?	labels:I think they’re like jewelry accessories. They range from wild to professional. If you style a very plain item in a wild way, it’s no longer a plain item. Like hair colored bobby pins used to sculpt your hair into a helicopter. I think scrunchies can be great with a sleek bun or a lovely scarf as a head wrap and still look professional. A headband with horns may not fit in all offices, but maybe that’s a vibe of an office that works.	episode_done:True
text:Hair accessories - professional or should be saved for casual environments?	labels:I think hair accessories in the workplace are fine as long as they're deployed thoughtfully. Nice scrunchies and those slightly high profile headbands can work pretty well when combined with a polished outfit and subtle jewelry (or more creative outfits and jewelry if your office is more casual). I work for a nonprofit that straddles a few different different fields (economic and business dev, higher ed, entrepreneurship, etc) so I interact with a wide range of dress codes and dress code interpretations.   I'd love to wear more headbands but I'm a whiner with a huge head and they pinch too badly to get through a work day; I love the look of the almost turban-styled headbands though and don't think they're automatically off limits for a biz caz office. But then I've worn a black scarf scrunchie to work on a sleek ponytail with a sleek turtleneck and skirt outfit, and I semi-regularly deploy interesting clips (geometric, tortoiseshell, or single jewel bobby pins).	episode_done:True
text:Hair accessories - professional or should be saved for casual environments?	labels:I have no problem if it’s a neutral colored hair accessory.  Scrunchies feel more casual, but barrettes, thin hair ties, and headbands could be worn tastefully.  Color, if used, should be limited and not too distracting.    Example:    Red headband and the rest of the outfit is neutral. —> sounds fine  Red headband, red lipstick, red necklace, orange shirt, zebra pants—> too much	episode_done:True
text:Hair accessories - professional or should be saved for casual environments?	labels:I can't believe this is even a thing. Obviously a brightly colored plastic goody barrette might look out of place but long haired women need tools to keep their hair in place.	episode_done:True
text:Hair accessories - professional or should be saved for casual environments?	labels:I struggle with this because I have a wavy bob and some days my waves need some reigning in.

text:Hair accessories - professional or should be saved for casual environments?	labels:There’s a woman in my office who wears her hair in a head wrap almost exclusively and she always looks so stunning and put together. I’ve noticed many of us have been wearing headbands more now working from home, but mostly in stripes or animal print. I have a tie dyed one that I only wear on weekends. I will say, in my office hair accessories seem to be well-received. I’ve done barrettes and a velvet ribbon previously and gotten many compliments. I’m also over 35, if it matters to you to know that context.	episode_done:True
text:Hair accessories - professional or should be saved for casual environments?	labels:I think they can work as long as you consider how they fit with your outfit and the colour palette.  A coworker wore a lovely green scarf tied loosely around her ponytail once and the rest of her outfit was grey/black and simple. It looked great. Had she worn a bright blue dress and bright red lipstick with it, maybe not, at least in a professional environment.  Some women get away with dressing a bit eccentric, but I’d say they’re almost always in a senior role, near retiring or very young. I say ‘get away with’ because we technically have no dress code, aside from something really inappropriate.  Intend to stick to neutrals and darker colours. I have a few plain tops in bright colours, but I always pair them with very simple and plain items. It’s not that dislike them, but they require more thought!	episode_done:True
text:Hair accessories - professional or should be saved for casual environments?	labels:My hair has been white for a long time, and I worked as an educator. I wore and still wear all kinds of fun scrunchies, pony tail holders, barrettes, clips etc, in complimentary colors (but not matching ) to my outfits. Students always enjoy comparing notes! In a corporate setting hair accessories probably need to be used more sparingly, depending on the job.	episode_done:True
text:Hair accessories - professional or should be saved for casual environments?	labels:Depends on the work environment and the type of accessory.    I work in a super casual work environment (WFH).  Even I wouldn't wear my cat ear headband unless I didn't have any video calls that day.    Now if I were in a BigLaw firm, things would be different.  Maybe I'd wear my hair half up using a plain silver clip but that's about it.   Or I'd use a tortishell claw.	episode_done:True

text:> Yes... until this month when I just went fuck it, and splurged on a bunch of loungewear.   Same. Finally bought new lounge wear and athleisure. My only regret is not buying these items sooner.

text:Have your clothing purchases dramatically dropped now that we can't go anywhere?	labels:I live in Canada, so not the worst, but in the second worst hit province, so our restrictions just got tightened significantly.  I definitely bought less during my covid unemployment for obvious reasons (ie no money).   I wouldnt say I buy less now that I've gotten a new job but im buying differently. Different athletic gear as I've started running since I cant play volleyball for fitness. I finally fucking found jeans that fit as close to perfectly as I'm gonna get and now I want to buy every colour to replace my badly fitting jean wardrobe. I'm not buying any biz caz stuff as it's indefinite work from home at the moment.	episode_done:True
text:Have your clothing purchases dramatically dropped now that we can't go anywhere?	labels:I've been buying more than ever before.

(I also gained a small amount of weight, not unrelated). I haven't been spending much though, basically all Old Navy.	episode_done:True
text:Have your clothing purchases dramatically dropped now that we can't go anywhere?	labels:I  never worried about or felt I understood anything about fashion before. I grew up in a family of so many girls who all feel like we don't know fashion. I always wanted to but it felt unobtainable. Well I went through some family stuff where I no longer need to be spending my free time and money taking care of some family members so I have been updating my wardrobe like crazy. I watched and learned about a ton of fashion for a month first with all the free time from covid. I have never spent this much on myself ever. Don't get me wrong everything was thrift store finds or clearence but I was still wearing almost only things from highschool before and I'm 25..

text:Have your clothing purchases dramatically dropped now that we can't go anywhere?	labels:Yes... until this month when I just went fuck it, and splurged on a bunch of loungewear. And now I’ve been bitten by the shopping bug again and want all the shoes, and contemplating whether I would actually wear a leather button up or if it’s just sit in my closet looking pretty...
text:I did the same thing back in may when it became clear that we weren’t going back to the office full time and I could do my work while drinking coffee in bed. If it makes you feel better I spent like $500 on loungewear and it feels great to have new loungy clothes, otherwise I bought myself a new scarf and two tops for my bday. My new obsession is masks, I have the bedazzled powerpuff  girls mask from Honeiibeth (shameless plug, their designs are so cute and they deserve the exposure) and I think I’m going to grab 2 more.	labels:Haha I resisted for a long time but now that it’s cold and I’m wearing sweatpants full time, I caved. Fortunately I’ve prevented myself from buying any masks because I’m making my own (or not... staring all all the cut out fabric waiting to be sewn lmao). Maybe I should count the cute floral fabrics I bought in my clothing purchases.	episode_done:True

text:PSA: Revive by Rent the Runway via Thredup	labels:I'm a frequent thredup buyer and seller but I do so with lots of caveats.   &#x200B;  1) I don't buy higher end goods from them because a) I don't trust the authenticity and b) they charge wayyyyyy more for more mid-level and up 'designer' or higher end brands. I'll just use Coach as an example. Vintage full leather Coach bags on thredup will sell for 50% or way way more than that same item on eBay from a random seller.   2) The level of use of their garments can really vary and the quality control is lacking. I've ordered items that were supposed to only be gently worn (they shouldn't really be selling anything that's more obviously worn), and gotten those items only to see that they are covered in animal hair and have obvious odors. But again, this isn't a constant issue and I don't buy final sale items from them so I can just return them.   &#x200B;  All of that having been said, I won't buy RTR items from thredup. I don't trust that their pricing will be reasonable secondhand market value nor do I trust the quality of the items.	episode_done:True

Mind you RTR is designer and not so much fast fashion options. I currently have a Temperley London dress from RTR that retails at $1195. Most of their items retail for minimum $150, average around $250. So if ThredUp is getting higher quality pieces, then it might be worth the look.	episode_done:True

text:Coveteur: An Ode to the Striped Shirt	labels:I have...entirely too many striped shirts.   I am a sucker for them. I was always told to wear vertical stripes because it would make me look slim. Growing up, I was a beanpole. no boobs, no hips, just enormous feet. So I started dabbling in horizontal stripes to make me look a little less scrawny.   then in my 20's I got my boobs done. those horizontal stripes now made the new boobs look absolutely vulgar and *I loved it*. I still do.  wide horizontal stripes are great for toning them down, thinner horizontal stripes really bring out the wow factor. I have a few tops that are a little baggier, with stripes, and I find that those are the perfect way to wear a casual tee while still being like LOOK SHE HAS A SHAPE!	episode_done:True

It is a blocky horizontal stripe with matte black/off-white and has a nice slouchy drape for being kind of a stiff cottony material.

text:I think it might matter a lot. Especially when buying online. The people setting the price knew what the item was worth approximately. If the item is crap you can only inflate the price so much. Even when you get into the whole brand markup.  There is a massive difference in quality for example in Nordstrom rack items that were made for the rack with a fake mark down vs the flagship store sale items. You can feel the difference in person but online how can you tell except a real mark-down?  I’m super interested in this topic OP. This is a good one.	labels:I think this is spot on, that there will be a difference in quality depending if it was made for outlets or boutiques. For stuff like leather goods (shoes and bags) and coats, there's a stark difference even if they're the same designer (ex: coach outlet vs coach, kate spade).

text:'Silk and Steel' NPR Article Discussion	labels:Interesting article. US urbanite perspective here, as I feel that’s important to state.   “Clothing is the barometer of change”   It’s interesting to think about the roots of what we now consider “classic pieces”, only coming from the last century. It makes me think about what changes we will see moving forward, and how classics may shift with shifting norms.   When I think about French fashion as a whole, as diverse as it it, the dominant idea is that of the Parisian bobo woman, a bit undone but thoroughly classic. Neutral colors (described as dye shortage, and also mourning),pops of color (described as identifying with a political allegiance) trench coats (wartime utilitarian piece) a nice wrist watch (wartime utilitarian piece). Clear connections. The roots are there. It makes sense. And practical! Don’t pull out your phone on the metro if you don’t have to, check your watch instead. Protect yourself from the urban grime and constant wet with blacks and greys and throw on a trench.   Import that idea and it’s further diluted. Current urban dressing has been reduced and simplified and given a new context. Along with increased production and lower quality, it feels so disconnected to me. Think about a flimsy fashion trench coat, or a thin pair of combat boots. Hollow, right? Think about a robust trench coat or thick, protective combat boots. A little excessive for hopping on a train or an uber to dinner, no?   I’m longing for clothing that aligns with my utilitarian needs again. I’ll reluctantly say, for now, long live loungewear!	episode_done:True

text:Yeah, the extra stress of maintaining the purchase would get old. That's one of the reason I avoid clothing rentals.

text:The finances of curating a high-end wardrobe through luxury resale: how much do you spend on clothing taking into account resale revenue?	labels:Clothes are never ever an investment. With the extremely few exceptions like Birkins and limited edition Chanel bags or stuff like that, it's not a thing.   Clothes will not retain their value and it's naive to think that you can buy something and expect to recoup more than half your money after *5 years* of wearing it. Especially since it's probably already a few years old when you buy it.  Pret a porter does not do as well as bags on the resale market. No one gives a shit that your old cardigan is designer because in another 5 years it will not only be worn out, it will be really outdated. If someone is paying hundreds for one single item, they're not buying worn from a collection 10 years ago AND still be willing to pay half the original price.
text:Seconding this	labels:	episode_done:True
text:The finances of curating a high-end wardrobe through luxury resale: how much do you spend on clothing taking into account resale revenue?	labels:Going through a place like TRR to resell a luxury item will likely yield a smaller return than expected. From what I call tell their commission rate is 30-50% and unless the garment is in near pristine condition after a few years it will likely retain less of the value than anticipated. Maybe TRR would try selling it for $300 then, but you would probably net half. Most items I see going for a premium are either very desirable brands or items that are virtually unworn.   Beyond all of that it’s difficult to predict where things would end up in a few years - what’s a desirable brand on the resale market now may not be in 3-5 years. Some designers will lose value more quickly.   It’s just really not a strategy I would account for when planning a clothing budget in the long run. You can readjust as you go based on money than comes in from returning items to the resale market - but I would fully expect that in all cases you will likely loose over half the original purchase price (especially if you are not selling it directly to another consumer).
text:This is an absolutely valid comment. I've bought and sold a lot of my mid-range brand pieces (stuff that costs ~200 - 600 USD new) in the last couple of years. Unless something is super popular, it can take MONTHS to find a buyer, and usually to a heavily discounted price.   And keep in mind, there are a lot of jerks. You'll end up arguing with a buyer sooner or later that you can't take returns because it didn't fit them, that the condition was indeed as described etc. Oddly enough, my most hassle-free things to sell were used branded jewelry.   Buying new and hoping for a high re-sale is a lost cause for most things. 2nd hand shops in my country will pay about 0-10% of the original price when you send/bring them your stuff. And that's for a good condition and no obvious signs of wear.   Even popular brands don't yield much. I've sent in a new with attached tags & packaging Tatras coat (costs ~900 usd here) and they offered me 240 USD. This was the most popular model of this brand.  For 2nd hand, you'll mostly win by buying second hand what you hopefully enjoy yourself. Buying something at 20-30% of the original value, use it for as long as you like, then donate/sell it for anywhere between 0-10%	labels:I totally hear you on the pains of resale. I agree that the situation is a little more hopeful if you buy secondhand to begin with, but from your and other's posts, there are still too many other variables that can make it difficult to "re-resale" so to speak.	episode_done:True
text:The finances of curating a high-end wardrobe through luxury resale: how much do you spend on clothing taking into account resale revenue?	labels:I think it doesn’t make a lot of sense to think of resale value for an object that gets worn and is subject to a lot of wear and tear with usage. How would you feel if you stain or rip or stretch out some garment you plan to resell later? It doesn’t make a lot of sense to me!  But the clothes you like and wear them. When you no longer like them or they not longer fit, pick a sustainable way to dispose of it then.	episode_done:True
text:The finances of curating a high-end wardrobe through luxury resale: how much do you spend on clothing taking into account resale revenue?	labels:Going through a place like TRR to resell a luxury item will likely yield a smaller return than expected. From what I call tell their commission rate is 30-50% and unless the garment is in near pristine condition after a few years it will likely retain less of the value than anticipated. Maybe TRR would try selling it for $300 then, but you would probably net half. Most items I see going for a premium are either very desirable brands or items that are virtually unworn.   Beyond all of that it’s difficult to predict where things would end up in a few years - what’s a desirable brand on the resale market now may not be in 3-5 years. Some designers will lose value more quickly.   It’s just really not a strategy I would account for when planning a clothing budget in the long run. You can readjust as you go based on money than comes in from returning items to the resale market - but I would fully expect that in all cases you will likely loose over half the original purchase price (especially if you are not selling it directly to another consumer).
text:The only way to make it work is to sell items directly, preferably ones you’ve bought at bargain basement prices. eBay, Grailed, Vestiaire etc will absolutely destroy your margin with their cut. This means building an Instagram following, finding your way into niche communities, and spending hours photographing, pricing, and listing items. If having thirsty dudes slide into your DMs is worth an extra $100 to you, it can go a long way towards making you profitable.   Even then, if you’re not buying things with an eye towards flipping, it’s going to be slow and potentially not worth the time investment. I’m a big Rick collector, and what I buy for myself has little overlap with what has significant resale value. I make most of my extra money on arbitrage between markets and reselling unisex pieces to the significantly larger male audience. If I wanted to make a significant dent in my clothing budget with resale, it’d turn into a 15-20hr/wk endeavour. Spending that same effort on my actual job would generate a much larger return, and compound over time to boot🤷‍♀️	labels:The point about ROI on time spent doing this vs working is well made. I have a hunch that I would enjoy the process, but if not, it is certainly not worth it.	episode_done:True
text:The finances of curating a high-end wardrobe through luxury resale: how much do you spend on clothing taking into account resale revenue?	labels:I used to buy a lot of high end stuff, mostly bags and shoes, with occasional clothing pieces in there. It was definitely easier to spend more knowing I could recoup something.   The problem was that I was never really honest with myself about what I could realistically sell things for, because it started to become justification if that makes sense at all. I never bought things with the intention of reselling them later, but it made it easier. It was always like “$1000 is a lot for this bag, but I can sell for 800, so it’s not that expensive.” In reality, it would sell for more like 500, and it would take a long time to sell. And then occasionally, I’d end up with something that I like, but that no one else really did, and it’s hard to sell something for pennies when you handed over hundreds. It’s a lot of psychological warfare with yourself, or at least it was for me. It also doesn’t help that selling high end designer pieces is much harder than selling mall stuff — a lot of fraud, a lot of entitled buyers *and* sellers, and just a lot of headache overall.   These days, I don’t buy nearly as much luxury stuff, and I try to buy mostly secondhand. I still resell some stuff, but I try to buy more classic things that I’ll keep for awhile. Resale factor does come into play, but if I’m honest, I have a list of things I need to sell, but haven’t taken the time to do.	episode_done:True
text:The finances of curating a high-end wardrobe through luxury resale: how much do you spend on clothing taking into account resale revenue?	labels:I’ve tried to resell my previously second-hand clothes that are higher end, i.e. Ferragamo, Dolce and Gabbanna, and Ralph Lauren Black Label. I’ve only made 1 sale out of all the clothes that I’ve listed on Poshmark. Although I did recoup most of my money on that sale, it was more work than it’s worth. As some people said below with the luxury market sometimes you get a fraction of the price that you bought it for, even if you bought it used prior. You will probably have more luck with luxury handbags than clothing. I wouldn’t use the value I could probably resell the clothing item for as justification to buy.  If you like the item and have the money just spring for it.	episode_done:True

text:The finances of curating a high-end wardrobe through luxury resale: how much do you spend on clothing taking into account resale revenue?	labels:I think this system may work if you flip things quickly - almost like “renting” clothes - but would be an extreme amount of work. However, if you plan to buy luxury items and get a lot of wear out of them, they depreciate rapidly. I would never spend $300 on cashmere that someone wore for years - it’s just not worth it. Also, as someone who adores eBay shopping and Posh, it’s more of a “buyer’s market” - I just scored new-in-box Aquatalia and La Canedienne boots, each for less than 1/4 of original price, and these are styles that are still being sold full-price online.   The only area I really see this working out is luxury bags - bags get less wear and tear, and Chanel will always have great resale value. But for an entire wardrobe, it just doesn’t seem viable (or worth the time).	episode_done:True
text:What are people's experiences with clothing challenges like trying not to buy clothes for a year/only buying second hand? What are some tips?	labels:I'm doing a no-buy year (exception being things like sports bras or replacements for things that are no longer wearable), and the biggest help to me was unsubscribing from ALL marketing emails. Removing those updates from brands and sales and such was helpful, especially since we're so inundated with online marketing nowadays.
text:I’ve read this tip somewhere: if you still want the marketing mails sometimes (e.g., to check whether there’s a discount code when you were going to buy something anyways), create a mail folder and a filter that automatically puts anything containing the word “unsubscribe” in there. That should catch all the newsletters and you still have them without being tempted to buy all the time	labels:	episode_done:True

text:What are people's experiences with clothing challenges like trying not to buy clothes for a year/only buying second hand? What are some tips?	labels:I think it’s important to buy things that you really LOVE. A lot of the time we feel the need to shop because we’re bored of our closets and feel like something is missing.  I love leather jackets and used to buy a lot of them in every color and finish. They were all nice and cute, but was never really in love with any of them. Maybe the leather was kind of thin. Maybe they didn’t have zippers in every place I wanted. Maybe they didn’t fit me quite perfectly. So I decided to treat myself to an expensive designer jacket and that I was OBSESSED with. And I haven’t felt the need to buy another leather jacket since.  I’m not saying you have to buy designer or anything like that, but buying more peices you love and are obsessed with will help you “shop your closet” every day and help curb some of your need to spend.	episode_done:True
text:What are people's experiences with clothing challenges like trying not to buy clothes for a year/only buying second hand? What are some tips?	labels:The problem is that doing a no-buy for a year is a HUGE undertaking that you are destined to fail. Not just you, people, in general. I think 3 months is a great start, and I think it's easier if you start with smaller, more attainable goals. It's like with a project at school or work - you break it up into smaller increments.  Once you get the hang of it, it'll be WAY easier to extend another month and another month. Looking at a year of no-buy is daunting. 3 months? More manageable.   The other thing is - you can't go cold turkey, because that is also unrealistic and sets you up for failure. I'd start with a low-buy, a circumstantial buy, a no-buy with a number of exceptions, etc. That enables you to form better habits.  The less strict you are being with yourself, the better your chances of success, overall, and long-term. If you go hard (one full year no-buy, no exceptions, fuck yeah!!!), it'll be super easy to break down and lose your progress, because the minute you give in, you've "failed" and what's the point of continuing. This is an endurance run.  Eventually, you get excited at your progress and want to see it through till the end. This is what helped me start saving money. I wanted to save for a deposit, but man, setting aside that first $1000 was hard. But once I saw my bank account growing and growing as months went by, it became easier. It became thrilling. How much could I save? How much closer to my goal could I get?   It's satisfying to see the progress, and it's harder to give up once you've made a "dent" in your ultimate goal.
text:Ohh thank you for your advice! I love this idea- I think that yeah, I don't really want to go without buying a dress for a special occasion from time to time. But yeah, saving is really addictive!! I totally agree that starting off slow is the best way to go about this!!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What are people's experiences with clothing challenges like trying not to buy clothes for a year/only buying second hand? What are some tips?	labels:I try to do no buys but fashion is my number one hobby and now that I have a little disposable income I buy things that I love. Whenever no-buys happen they're not on purpose, I just happened to not have bought anything.   So, for me, approaching this less from an environmental impact and more from a "personal ethos" standpoint helps my spending habits. Do I admire the construction, the fabric, the style? Even if I don't wear this a lot will I be happy with it in my closet? When it's time to part with my clothes I sell them online and hope someone will buy it before taking it to goodwill because I want the garment to continue it's life (lol). I think by developing your own thoughts around spending and what you want, the sustainability and mindfulness will come naturally.   ALSO if you like Zara secondhand is the time to buy! I haven't shopped their in years but I do have some stuff that's really held up and looks good from them. But I also totally get why you wouldn't wanna but anything from them at all.	episode_done:True
text:What are people's experiences with clothing challenges like trying not to buy clothes for a year/only buying second hand? What are some tips?	labels:I purged my wardrobe a lot and now have a strict one-in one-out policy, so if I buy a new dress, I have to get rid of a dress, if I buy a new shirt, I have to get rid of a shirt, etc. It really helps when I'm shopping because if I can't come up with something in my wardrobe I want to let go of, I don't actually need that item.  It's not a perfect system and sometimes I fail at it... but I'm trying!	episode_done:True
text:What are people's experiences with clothing challenges like trying not to buy clothes for a year/only buying second hand? What are some tips?	labels:I would recommend, first of all, assessing your goals and trying to make rules that are fair to you, and which can be adapted into life long habits.   Flexibility is important, especially when it comes to something you will eventually *need* to do, like purchasing clothing.  Not buying a single thread of clothing for an entire year was a failure waiting to happen (because, y'know, shit happens,) and it isn't even that helpful if it just results in binge periods before and after.      What works best for me is keeping a system of criteria for shopping.  If you actually *need* something, buy it guilt-free, and then budget out the things you don't need.  *Always* assess potential purchases critically: Ask yourself it it suits your wardrobe, if it's practical, if it fits well, it it's well-made and if it's something you are likely to wear a lot.   If helps, reserve nonessential purchases for use as a reward when you complete major tasks.  Try to avoid shopping altogether if you know you're not supposed to be buying stuff.  If you feel like you can't stop shopping, there's almost definitely *something* else you can be doing that scratches the same psychological itch.
text:I recently start using Pinterest again. By pinning you can 'shop' for all kinds of things without actually spending money. However, this might lead to spending (I am using it to research my 'curated wardrobe' and it has led to a couple of purchases).	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What are people's experiences with clothing challenges like trying not to buy clothes for a year/only buying second hand? What are some tips?	labels:I did a no buy from June 2018 to June 2019 because I was getting married and then some other life things happened right after. What it did for me was made me realize how much I didn’t need to buy clothing like I had been, and it made me transition to buy almost solely secondhand. I’m still buying almost completely secondhand, but, I have relaxed a bit because 2020 is a shit year and I told myself that, if I can afford something without financial hardship, than get it if I want it.	episode_done:True
text:What are people's experiences with clothing challenges like trying not to buy clothes for a year/only buying second hand? What are some tips?	labels:for me the biggest motivator for only buying second hand is the ethical aspect. just reminding myself each time i'm tempted to buy first hand that the industry behind the clothes is vile and i don't want to contribute to that. the environmental aspect is a plus.   as for not buying clothes at all, i can't help because i love fashion and i don't really have any interest in giving it up. i started shopping more frequently when i started buying second hand actually because i just love digging through piles and piles of clothes to find the perfect piece. it feels very rewarding	episode_done:True

text:From Runway to reddit: Ready-to-Wear Purchasing and the Fashion Calendar Explained	labels:Excellent, excellent write up, thank you so much for sharing and breaking down the process in a way that is easy to understand.   >  If you're cruising to Cabo over Thanksgiving, wintering in the Mediterranean after Christmas, and enjoying late season skiing in Aspen in May, you must have a wardrobe to match. What designers were delivering and retailers stocking was out of step with consumers' buying habits.  This was a great way to explain how the precollections help fill in the gaps, but it will be interesting to see brands cutting down on resort or cruise collections. I normally enjoy precollections cause I find that they tend to be more fun and leave room for more creativity by the designers.  > At the high end, fashion is a relationship business. Sales associates at brand flagships and independent boutiques keep up with clients via phone, text, and e-mail. Rather than making orders through a website, you reach out to your SA and ask "do you have x in?" or they contact you as new stock comes in and try and sell you on whatever bizarre runway item people with both money and sense 👏will👏not👏buy👏.  It’s a transactional relationship and a lot of clients are addicted to the exclusivity of it all (Hermès anyone?). It’s almost a bragging right to have a relationship with a SA who can give you early access to collections or decide you’re worthy of being offered a particular handbag or watch.	episode_done:True

text:From Runway to reddit: Ready-to-Wear Purchasing and the Fashion Calendar Explained	labels:This is great and very well done! I've been working in fashion for about 15(!!) years now, first as a designer, currently a key costumer for tv/film.  I worked in mass market (from very fast fashion to mid range 'women's better' lol) and our calendar is even stupider- the first place I worked churned out a brand new delivery every single month.    What's your thoughts on how the pandemic will affect trends? I have two theories: one, that because nobody is going anywhere, trends will 'freeze' and little will change in terms of new silos or exciting ideas. My other theory is that since fashion is a swinging pendulum, we'll all be so sick of sweatpants and t-shirts that very elaborate, bold choices will be favored even by less adventurous markets. Take the bestselling 'strawberry dress' everyone bought without anywhere to go.   Anyway! Thanks again for a great writeup!

A vaccine for the virus has been made widely available and businesses may operate at full capacity, including bars, clubs, salons, etc. How will this influence fashion?	labels:Hot Girl Summer cancelled, it's gonna be a Hot Girl Year.  I expect more black tie/formal affairs as well as full embrace of anything goes in more casual settings, if SS21's most well received shows are anything to go by. People are going to want to see and be seen.
text:Tons of formal stuff for sure, with the amount of weddings and engagements and all the associated parties and celebrations there will be. It'll probably permeate everyday wear too, and putting more effort in and having a more "done" look will swing back into being desirable.   I know girls who are actively planning their "look" for weddings in 2021 and 2022 - people wanna have shit to look forward to and get excited about, and wearing all the cool stuff you longer for in lockdown is exciting.	labels:I gave birth at the end of 2019 and was soooo excited to be invited to 3 very swanky weddings in DC and NYC in 2020.  Was spending a lot of time looking up dresses and inspiration since I knew I would have my pre-pregnancy body back by then.  Needless to say, I will be going all out in 2021 if those weddings are allowed to resume.
text:2 years post baby and just finally finished breastfeeding. Lol when you did it would only take a year to lose the weight!   Those last 10 pounds are a bitch. The two months of quarantine gin and tonics did not help.	labels:Yeah, it basically took me 6 months to lose the final 5 lbs.  I wasn't willing to cut carbs or go below 1500 calories, so it was a lot of back and forth and plateaus.	episode_done:True

text:Start small and work your way up! Maybe sew some pillowcases first to learn making straight/even hems and borders (or I guess you can use scrap cloth but that’s not as fun or rewarding) - also maybe kitchen cloths - and then maybe you could try tailoring your outfits. Maybe a pants is slightly too long, or a blouse is too loose - now you can hem up the pants and take in the blouse. Don’t cut cloth until you’re comfortable!! Sewing is the opposite of cooking - you can subtract but never add, while cooking you can always add but not subtract. And even then, when you build up to the stage where you want to cut cloth, maybe try that project on scrap material first lol. Cloth can be expensive, so as pretty as it is... start small.	labels:	episode_done:True

I know you’re on a budget, but it can be done!   Literally all of my cashmere is either thrifted or bought on clearance, so the max I would have paid for a sweater is around $35, with the low end around $12.

text:How do you feel about vegan/faux leather?	labels:It’s plastic + marketing lingo. Not a fan.	episode_done:True

text:How do you feel about vegan/faux leather?	labels:I’m vegan and I try to avoid them. I recognize they’re made from plastic and not really good for the environment either. I think it’s better to thrift gently used leather clothes than buy new fake leather.
text:Even if it’s not gently used, you can restore leather with conditioners.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do you feel about vegan/faux leather?	labels:I’m not a fan tbh. My experience which faux leather is that it does look nice... but not for long because it cracks/peels. Also it’s not very sustainable because it’s made of plastics and has a short lifespan (depending on how regularly it is worn). Real leather on the other hand can have a super long lifespan with proper care, and too me it just looks way nicer because real leather items (like boots and bags) are usually made with more care because it’s a more expensive material. I’ve thrifted all of my leather items too, which is also more sustainable for the environment (and my wallet!)	episode_done:True
text:How do you feel about vegan/faux leather?	labels:Unfortunately all the pleather items I've had ended up peeling so I tend to avoid fake leather now.
text:I’ve had no issues with mine. I even have leggings from Old Navy with faux leather fronts and ones with wide side panels and they go in the wash just fine. Had them for years at this point.

text:How do you feel about vegan/faux leather?	labels:There is no such thing as vegan leather.  There's leather, and then there's plastic that has been manipulated to immitate leather grain.  The latter has its uses--it's cheap, it can be made in literally any shape,  it can be made waterproof and insulating, and it certainly isn't *ugly*\--but it's certainly not leather.  Personally, I try to avoid it.  My reason are as follows:   1) It doesn't have the durability I need--it  loses its shape easily, it hardens and cracks easily, and unlike leather it is almost impossible to repair once damaged.   2) It doesn't have the sustainability I want--sure you spare an animal's hide, but you could wear out ten pairs of PVC shoes in the time it takes to wear out one well-made pair of leather shoes.  Now you have ten pairs of PVC shoes floating in the ocean killing sea turtles and the cow ends up on a plate regardless.  3) Aesthetically... it is cheap plastic.  And it looks like cheap plastic.  There are some styles that can accommodate or even luxuriate on cheap plastic items, but mine is not one such style.  There is simply no replacement for the depth of color and texture given by leather.     4) Chafing oh god chafing     That said, I've seen some folks look really good in PVC.  I used to look really good in PVC too, back when I was more wild and reckless.  But now that I've become the sort of person who gets her materialist thrills out of vintage copper cookware and exotic tea blends, I find I am also someone who really loves the beauty and comfort of leather.  You can call it an Old Fart Thing if you like.	episode_done:True

I think buying secondhand leather items is better in terms of quality and environmental impact than faux leather.
text:If you've already committed to the faux leather pants, try to eliminate the squeak with a dab of mink/neatsfeet oil on a cloth. Then apply to the areas that are the loudest lol. If you want to stay away from animal products, try a small amount of coconut oil :)	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Technical/Labwear but make it fashion	labels:I've been working on construction sites for for years, and I've found that my work wear influences my fashion sense more than my fashion sense influences my workwear  I'd say the only influence fashion has on my workwear is cut. I wear skinny carpenter's jeans and make sure that my shirts, jackets, and high viz vest are all fitted at the waist. This is mostly so I don't look like a child, though, and less about fashion  I wear quality boots to work every day, so now I tend to buy my fun shoes from places prioritize comfort, weatherproofing, and sole grip. Less ASOS, more Sorel  I love Dovetail jeans, which have taught me the joys of a pocket for every tool. Now, my favorite purse is a crossbody wallet from Duluth because it has slots for all my cards and cash and two pockets that are perfect for my phone and my facemask.  Basically, construction has taught me to prioritize dressing practically so I can live my best life without digging for shit deep in a massive purse while dying in uncomfortable shoes. I've got shit to do and my belongings are not gonna hold me back!	episode_done:True

text:Technical/Labwear but make it fashion	labels:I've been inspired by the ladies in the lab that choose to do their hair nicely.

They mostly involve braids or just one to add a little something extra. They are more akin to easy bridal updos.	episode_done:True
text:Technical/Labwear but make it fashion	labels:I’m a chemist and my go to is dark skinnies and plain t-shirts or a blouse with a cardigan in every color of the rainbow in the summer and relatively plain sweaters in the fall/winter months. I’m always cold so I love turtlenecks and they look dressier with my lab coat than other things. I’ve got spill resistant boots from Red Wing that I change into when I go into the lab but I generally wear flats and booties if I’m just doing office work that day.  I usually wear pearl earrings and light makeup to look more put together but nothing too fancy.	episode_done:True
text:Technical/Labwear but make it fashion	labels:The compant I'm currently an intern at (laboratory) is actually pretty chill about it. Legs and feet covered and hair tied up are a must but other than that i have quite some freedom. I'm not sure if my style can be described as 'fashionable' but besides the basic blue or black jeans I usually try to play around a bit with my shoes, blouses (linnen bouses are great) and some accessoires like necklaces or small earrings and sometimes some hair clips to make it a bit more 'me'.	episode_done:True

text:Technical/Labwear but make it fashion	labels:Ooh! I’m a scientist in healthcare. I sometimes wear scrubs, but usually I wear pants and a plain tee or blouse.

I work in one of the few stem fields(medical tech) that’s female dominated. Most of my coworkers wear scrubs, but the official dress code is “scrubs or business casual”.	episode_done:True
text:Technical/Labwear but make it fashion	labels:I work in a physics research lab and I'm often the only woman in my workplace. For safety I always wear closed shoes and long pants, and for practicality I like pants with lots of pockets. Duluth Trading Company has the best women's pants I've found - I like the Flexpedition style the best but I have a bunch of them. You can get them for \~$40 when there's a sale and the pockets are huge! I also have some coveralls from them that I love because they come in an XS and actually fit me. I have to have my work special order things like gloves and safety goggles because the mens sized ones we had don't fit me. For shoes I like boots or sneakers and wear oxfords when I want to be fancy.  Most of the men just wear sneakers, jeans, and a t-shirt or flannel, so that's typically what I wear so I don't stand out too much. I also don't wear a lab coat at work, so my shirts often get dirty so I don't like to wear nicer clothes at work anyway. I'm comfortable with my androgynous style and don't feel pressure to dress up more. I just wear my nice sweaters and such on the weekend. I don't wear much jewelry anyway, and I actually got a pixie cut last year because I was tired of putting my hair up. Cute and practical!  The best work clothes tip I have is to keep a second set of clothes at work. A cardigan is especially important if you office is cold, and it can help dress up an outfit if you have a surprise meeting. I walk to work so I'm wearing snow boots in the winter and shorts in the summer, and then I just change into my work clothes and shoes when I get there.	episode_done:True
text:Technical/Labwear but make it fashion	labels:Omg when I worked in a lab/office (tissue bank) I used to take a photo of my outfit everyday before I left the house!

Imagur?	episode_done:True
text:Technical/Labwear but make it fashion	labels:I’ve had internships in both a manufacturing capacity and R&D and I’m back in mostly R&D now (but working from home haha). In manufacturing I wore a combo of jeans, corduroys, and some more casual leaning dress pants with sweaters most of the time and switched between my trusted Chelsea boots and safety shoes depending on what area I was working in that day. For R&D I was able to dress more “fashionable” based on whether or not I was working in the lab. Lab days mostly focused on sweaters and casual dress shirts with sleeves I could easily roll up/down, jeans or dress pants and a variety of closed toed shoes (Chelseas, heeled black booties, in the summer I could get away with sperrys). Non lab days I liked to wear dresses, long skirts, and my nicer dress pants.   Looking ahead I’ve been trying to combine my work wardrobe with every day/weekend pieces. I focus a lot on getting sweaters that I actually enjoy as opposed to ones that are designated for work (love a good turtleneck and actually cute cardigans). I’ve also been looking into more natural fibers but getting them secondhand so the price isn’t so crazy (also so I don’t feel too too bad if they get messy at work)! I also try and avoid “only work shoes” so my dressy shoes are ones I could wear to an interview/presentation but also out to a nice dinner. There were definitely a few times at work in the past where I felt more dressed up than my colleagues but I don’t think it was ever looked down on. I think dressing to your personal style is a great way to express yourself at work as long as it’s appropriate for the sitch and safe for you and your colleagues in a lab/technical setting!	episode_done:True
text:What are your favourite ways to style a black leather moto jacket?	labels:People have already covered the dresses, but the dress/leather jacket combo is for sure one of my favorite ways to style them. If there's enough room in the sleeves/body, i sometimes layer a hoodie underneath during colder weather for a more skater girl type of look. I love wearing it with a white top, light wash jeans, and my black leather combat boots (for me, doc martens but could be any boot with a similar color/texture to the jacket) bc i feel like a rocker from the 80s.

text:How has your style and shopping habits changed with age and financial standing?	labels:Both my mother and I grew up in relative scarcity. My mom’s way of dealing with that is to hoard clothes. If she seems something cheap that can be gifted later to someone or worn for herself or her family she will buy it, because it’s always better to have too much than too little.   My way of dealing with scarcity was to learn to sew. I purchase clothes that are good quality wherever I can find them for a decent price and I fix them to last longer and/or fit me. So whereas when I was little and would shop with my mom she would buy however much she could, I don’t think I’ve ever bought more than 3 pieces at a time since I started shopping alone.	episode_done:True
text:How has your style and shopping habits changed with age and financial standing?	labels:I'm in my early thirties and live a comfortable life. In my early twenties I loved shopping for secondhand clothing and had a regular loop of my local thrift stores, Clothes Mentors, and consignment shops. I was always on the hunt for a good deal and was really developing my personal style (with a lot of experimentation and questionable choices.)  A few things that I've been reflecting on recently:  1. I no longer find shopping (specifically browsing) fun. Now I would much rather seek out a specific item on Poshmark and only shop to replace needed items or fill legitimate gaps.  2. Related to the above, I have a short list of brands that I buy and it's based on quality, warranty (I have a lot of outdoor/athletic gear), and environmental impact. Right now, I'm looking for a Patagonia Houdini for at least 50% off retail. I'm not in a rush to buy it but I'm also not aimlessly shopping for "a windbreaker" and then come home with three t-shirts. 3. Fabric/fit snobbery. I don't care if the cutest top I've ever seen is on clearance for $3... if it's 100% polyester it's just not coming home with me. Same with "I really like it, but if only it..." I have far more clothing than I need so there's never a moment where buying a pair of leggings is the difference between owning pants and going to work naked. I can wait till I find the perfect item.  4. Lifestyle creep is real! Across all my spending (groceries, clothing, hobbies) I just don't pay attention to the cost as much. I still have an upper threshold that gives me pause, but I don't have any month-to-month "oh, I can't afford that right now." Which, I really should be saying far more often!   All together, it takes most of the fun out of shopping because I am so picky and can usually say, "okay, I really don't need/want this."
text:Mid 30s, and this all rang so true for me. It was a sad day when I was finally honest with myself and realized I just don’t like “going shopping” anymore.  I used to be able to spend hours combing through the racks at Last Call or Off 5th looking for an amazing deal or whatever struck my fancy.   Now I know what I want, I want to price check a few other sites to make sure I’m getting a decent price, and I want to be done with it.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How has your style and shopping habits changed with age and financial standing?	labels:I’m way more environmentally cautious now that I’m in my late 20s. As a teenager, I was into fast fashion because, hey, it’s cheap! But now if I buy new, I look for quality clothing that will last for a long time (perhaps decades). I also have a goal of  not buying more than 3 new items per year. My “new” clothes are generally bought second hand or obtained through Bunz (trading app) or my local “Buy Nothing” Facebook group.	episode_done:True
text:How has your style and shopping habits changed with age and financial standing?	labels:Kind of. As I’ve gotten older I don’t mind spending more on a good quality piece that’ll last. I want good quality, timeless pieces now.	episode_done:True
text:How has your style and shopping habits changed with age and financial standing?	labels:I'm definitely more into quality and classic design Vs something cheap, cheerful and trendy now.   Perhaps it is a result of being able to afford it more, but I think it's mostly due to being more aware of good quality fabric which lasts, look better and ultimately tired of fast fashion which I'd wear for a few weeks/months and then relegate to the back of the closet.   Looking back, the cheap polyester tops, skirts etc did nothing favourable for my body and just did not look as good as I thought it did at the time.	episode_done:True
text:How has your style and shopping habits changed with age and financial standing?	labels:I’ve never really enjoyed shopping that much but now that I’m older and much heavier I have a really hard time with the limited options that come with being a size 18.   My style is way less trendy these days and now that I’m almost 30 I don’t really care about staying on top of all of that. I like more classic designs that don’t go out of style. I work a business casual desk job full time so I usually stick to skinny black pants, cute black flats/boots/loafers and a fun blouse or sweater. I’ve come to really appreciate a good statement earring so I have a nice little collection going now.	episode_done:True
text:How has your style and shopping habits changed with age and financial standing?	labels:I grew up in a larger family without a lot of money, so I got really good at maximizing the number of pieces that I could buy on a tiny budget. The down side of that was that I got into a bad habit of buying pieces that weren't quite me because my selection was limited to what I could find in my size on sale racks. And then with limited access to laundry in college/early career, I'd prioritize quantity over quality so that I could make fewer laundry trips.  Now that I'm more financially secure and have a washer-dryer in my apartment, I am a lot more picky about what pieces I buy. I want the fits, styles, fabrics, and colors to be things that I truly love, rather than what's good enough and cheap. I can wait longer to find a piece that I truly love, and spend a little more on that piece, rather than buying the cheapest thing that I can find that will serve a particular need. I also don't feel the need to buy things just in case I need them, because if a need does pop up, I can afford to buy something to fill that need. And that's something that I think a lot of people who grow up with money don't realize--when you don't have a lot, any unplanned expense can be an emergency, and so you end up keeping a lot of things you don't use often because you know you can't afford to replace them. Downsizing the amount you own is much easier mentally when you know you can afford to replace a stained sweater, so you don't need to keep that one that doesn't quite fit right but is presentable enough.	episode_done:True
text:How has your style and shopping habits changed with age and financial standing?	labels:As a recent college grad I had 3 prs of shoes and I thought a polo-style shirt and khakis were all I needed for work. Shopping wasn’t a big thing.  I was just trying to live independently and pay my bills.  Making outfits was challenging because I didn’t have the items to make a cohesive wardrobe that could last a work week without re-washing something. I did have a few items for going out that I swapped with friends. Who know where those things ended up.  Mid-career (and middle-aged), I think more about my personal style than trends. I enjoy creating styles that don’t appear over planned, yet are well put together. I’ve built what I consider a personal fashion archive over the years that I can pull from.  The stores I buy from have changed...or least the % of my wardrobe from certain stores has changed.  I’m more aware of quality and fabrication, though I sometimes compromise fabric preference for style. Conversely, I will drop some coin on high-quality items made from natural fibers, good shoes, coats,and an occasional luxury handbag (or two).	episode_done:True
text:How has your style and shopping habits changed with age and financial standing?	labels:Significantly. I lived in jeans, old t-shirts from running races, and worn out running shoes all through college and grad school. That was almost my entire wardrobe. I really didn't care much about fashion and couldn't afford anything even if I did.    After I got a job, I had the money but still no inspiration.   Then I realized I was trans and that my lack of interest was only in men's fashion.  Now I actually care about putting together looks and take joy in shopping for and trying on clothes.   It's been a wild ride	episode_done:True
text:How has your style and shopping habits changed with age and financial standing?	labels:When I was in my early 20's, my first priority was to look "cute" or "hot". 5 inch heels were just what I did. I had no money obviously, so it ended up being most anything I could find on clearance.   I'm in my mid-30's now and I simply don't wear it if it isn't comfortable. Not to say I live in sweatpants (well, pre-pandemic anyway), but I prioritize my comfort, looking relatively pulled together, and not tragically out of style but still not necessarily trendy. I don't wear heels.   I don't shop clearance anymore. If it's a well made item that I want and I've taken the time to think about it, I buy it. Otherwise, I do a lot of thrifting and wear what I like of that and sell the rest.	episode_done:True

Ready for action floor staff with snappy tennis shoes and an athletic headband?

Grey's is one of the only brands that fits my long torso and has options for no spandex.

I agree that Figs are probably the top brand for scrubs. But I also want to plug a brand that I think did a great job on making more fashionable cuts/colors/styles: Med Couture. They have a lot of options for cut, and the fabric was softer than most of the other scrubs that I sorted (all had been laundered several times in industrial machines).	episode_done:True

text:Cyberpunks Not Dead - Inspo Album	labels:Digging this! I just finished a month-long cyberpunk roleplay/cosplay/lifestyle and the elements that I was looking for in my fashion choices were sharp edges, black or neon, things that light up, face coverings or face paint to confuse facial recognition software, straps, heavy black eye makeup, bright hair, metallics (although that's just because I have metallics-- I think iridescence is more on-brand). We modified it to tie in some vaporwave/outrun aesthetic as well, so pastel pinks were on the table as well as anything that looks glitchy. I'm loving seeing the overlap and non-overlap between the looks we went with and this album!   Favorite cyber-looks are the wide-brim hat with the blue veil, the Calvin Lou look with the spiked hair, the Emporio Armani look with the black translucent fabric and the tiny 90s shades, the Each Other "free hugs" photo, and the Rocostru silver straps.  I love the veil because I think facial masking is a part of what I imagine a cyberpunk future to be about and I think the color scheme is right on-point. The Calvin Lou and Emporio Armani looks both just nail a Matrix-era vibe to me. I love the way both looks play with showing skin and I love the hair styling for both... both read very cyberpunk to me. The Each other look is great partly because I love turning the storm trooper "free hugs" guy into a nostalgic cyber-icon but mostly because the 3D glasses are super on-brand-- both colorful and technological-- and the outfit is also super functional. And, loving the silver straps in general.  I wish I'd had the idea and courage to go more nipple-forward in my costuming for last month... digging that part of this album and loving the implication that our future is more down with women's nipples.

text:Discussion: what does your shopping process look like?	labels:I have two kinds of shopping experiences. One is:  - carefully think about gaps in my wardrobe - search in my favorite stores for key items  - save the items - come back to the items with fresh eyes a few days or weeks later - decide whether to buy  OR  - fall in love with something (usually shopping in person) - impulse buy it - get excited about my new clothes or feel regret deep in my soul  Edit: thanks for the award! 🥰

text:Discussion: what does your shopping process look like?	labels:I have a 'To Buy' Google doc that I update constantly. It has two main sections: an 'asap'/need section, and a 'consider' section. I only buy clothes/shoes/accessories if there's a 'hole' in my wardrobe- something I feel is missing, either because I need to replace, expand, etc.   I also window shop on TRR constantly, and Nordstrom and REI sometimes. I save things I like within my price range (including things that are currently too expensive, as they could go on sale). I save things I come across elsewhere that I like to Pinterest.   When I have something in the 'asap' category, I check my saves in the most applicable app/store, and choose from there.	episode_done:True
text:Discussion: what does your shopping process look like?	labels:I'm a year into a wardrobe overhaul so the current system is, 1) consult my ridiculously extensive list, 2) walk the whole store, touch everything, pick up way too much, 3) edit, 4) try on, if possible, 5) check fabric content &refer back to the list, 6) leave with maybe one item.  I stopped impulse buying a for while, but I've realized that the wilder stuff I like is consistent, so I have a list for that too (current craving is chartreuse.)  I adore prints though, so now I make myself just take a picture if the fit/colours don't make sense for me.  Actual impulse buys are now either really practical pieces with prints or loud colour (i.e. my bright purple turtleneck,) or things that feel nice with weird cuts.  I don't shop online much, since I get either overwhelmed by choice or frustrated that I can't find exactly what I'm looking for, and most my enjoyment comes from touching all the things, which is now bad, so I've been using Depop since quarantine started mainly because if feels...more casual or something.  I'll hop on it when I'm bored, do a quick search on whatever I was thinking of, like a ton of stuff, save whatever actually looks like it'll fit and is a good deal, and either buy it immediately or sit on it until it goes on sale.	episode_done:True

text:Discussion: what does your shopping process look like?	labels:Hah what a funny question.  Something I need/would be super useful: 1) Think “I could really use ___ basic”.  2) Find a suitable one that’s inexpensive, say 25 dollars, but think “Do I really want to spend money on this right now?”  3) Close tab because I decide nah I don’t need this.  4) Complain about not having basics all the time.   Something statement/impractical and pretty much always expensive.  1) See it. Fall in love. Um and ah about the price.  2) Leave tab open. Can’t stop thinking about it for 1-2 days.  3) Give in and buy impulsively.  4) The lucky part: receive item and still in love with it.   My wardrobe is 80% the latter and only 20% the former but at least I love my closet. I can only think of less than a handful of items I’ve bought and really not worn. I feel like impulsive purchasing works pretty well if you already know what makes you love items.  But damn I could really just use some more tshirts and jeans.

Search online against my favourite brands 5. Search against sales 6. If the stars align and points 4 and 5 meet, it was meant to be and I pull the trigger.

I browse the website/ wander aimlessly at the mall, than I get something completly unrelated. Sometimes these items turn out to be favorites, but more often than not I end up not wearing them. Cherry on top, sometimes I feel bad about having unworn clothing. I proceed and attempt to DIy them, destroying them completly in the process. I should really quit doing that.	episode_done:True

text:Creative pragmatism light	labels:This style is surprisingly attainable for me after several years of hardcore minimalism. Once I got to a place where my basics are both on point and super pragmatic, then I have been able to incorporate a few Tibi and Tibi-like statement pieces into my rotation. I’m no longer a minimalist in terms of style - I like buying a couple “big impact” things every year to jazz up my clothes, especially oversized  or dramatic drape or “origami structure” on tops and coats. A single piece really changes an outfit and you don’t need many pieces in rotation to suddenly change your style. Amy Smilovic appears to do a similar thing - keep several things “basic” (neutral color, solid/no pattern, uniform texture, unadorned (no bling or fringes etc) and the play with one thing (her thing seems to be oversized fit and pleats).  The only reason I bring up minimalism is because I cannot emphasize more how much the basics being “just right” makes my dramatic pieces work. Especially with oversized, it’s a thin line between slob and stylish. Those big pleated dad pants Amy Smilovic wears? The rest of the outfit should be sharp or you look like you simply don’t know how clothes should fit. Not everyone needs to first develop an “unfashionable” base before reaching for both fashionable and pragmatic, but I did.   As for Tibi, I know them most for silks and for their origami shapes. GoSilk is a great option for patterned silk and Roksanda has the shapes. Ganni and Comme Les Garcons has some of the quirkinesses and oversized looks. But none of them are cheap either unless you score a good sale. If you can identify exactly what you like about Tibi, we can make more recommendations.
text:Thank you for this thoughtful and helpful answer! I come from the opposite end, full closet, constantly shifting from boho to grunge and then to sporty again until I was fed up with the whole "I don't know what to wear" thing - I never understood what exactly I liked about a clothing piece or style.  I ended up with some good quality basic pieces, not boring, functional, versatile and now I try to build from there. What I am really looking for are clothing pieces, in which an idea, a thought was invested - meaning there is something deliberate about it, interesting cut, texture, print. But I also want them to work together with other things I own.   Thank you for recommending Gianni and Comme des Garcons, I have some things from them and they are more affordable for me. I also like COS for good fabrics and robustness, but then again it is quite popular where I live and many people shop there too. Arket is even cheaper, but it is a little bland for me. There are also some european brands like Closed or Baum und Pferdgarten, Essentiel Antwerp, however it always depends on a particular season/trend whether I find something there or not.	labels:> Baum und Pferdgarten  Ohhh I love them, my local boutique has finally started carrying this and it’s so fun!	episode_done:True
text:Creative pragmatism light	labels:I love their (Amy, Dione, and the Tibi brand) style but sometimes their pretentiousness irks me. They go like oh you can wear whatever you like but then they come up with 1000 rules about what should not be worn together. Anyway, if you like that style and also like to DIY things you can totally adjust regular items to look like Tibi ones. For instance, the asymmetrical shirt that closes a bit on the diagonal, the buttons that are used to pull up the sleeves, the ankle bands on some of their pants, etc. can all be recreated relatively easily and you don't need to spend 100s of $ on their "affordable" items (Amy's words, I always crack up when she boasts about how affordable Tibi clothes are).
text:Yeah, that‘s true. There are many many rules as to what they consider „good style“. At least Amy often says that it‘s just a preference and nobody has to follow her advice.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Creative pragmatism light	labels:I have to say, I had never heard of Amy Smilovic before, but I am glad to have been introduced!  Her style and the Tibi style are really not anything that I would wear, and yet I find a lot of her advice really useful.  In particular, I watched her 'closet cleanout' story, and her "blocks" as ways of categorizing clothes make a lot more sense to me than the basics/statements dichotomy. She divides it into WOFs (WithOut Fails), I&Os (Ins & Outs), and HTHs (Had To Haves).  In this way, an item can be bold and colourful and still be a staple in my closet (a without fail), or it could be very simple and basic, and still fall into the In & Out or Had to Have category.  I guess in my mind, basics are usually black or a neutral colour, but statements are colourful, but that's not really how my style works. A head-to-toe black outfit isn't necessarily made of basics, and one that is full of colours isn't going to be garish if it's done right.  As long as a Had to Have is paired with many Without Fails, it will still look cohesive and "you".  I also love how Dione describes something that's matchy-matchy as being "lady" haha. Note taken.

text:Can you please elaborate more on your "just right" basics?  I have been attempting to minimize my wardrobe and find that balance between creative expression and pragmatism for probably the last decade.  I love fashion, but live an active and semi-nomadic lifestyle that really demands a simplified and wearable wardrobe. Five or more years ago, this meant structuring my wardrobe around black leggings and a black stretchy h&m t-shirt dress. It worked for me then, but nowadays it feels both outdated and for someone younger than me.  I'm really trying to nail down the basics to make my \[often thrifted\] statement pieces look more elevated.  The other thing is that wearing tight bottoms and a loose or flowy top used to be fashionable, and it was ridiculously easy to style, at least for my body type.  Nowadays the silhouette has flipped (volume on the bottom) and I'm a little lost as to how to work that into a pared-down wardrobe.	labels:[INVALID]	episode_done:True

text:Creative pragmatism light	labels:I follow her too and am interested in the answers. I love the way she styles herself because she looks effortlessly cool to my eyes. The clothes mostly wouldn‘t work for me because I‘m only 5‘1, so lots of things are too big. Anything ‚oversized‘ just makes me look a little childish. I still try to incorporate some of her tips. There are brands like COS that do similar things with cool shapes and ‚different‘ basics.  ETA: Do you like the pieces themselves or her style philosophy? Because occasionally I think the clothes she presents are.. pretty ugly, tbh
text:I am whole 5'4 but I love oversize, especially now having workliveexisted at home for so many months, I cannot bother with uncomfortable clothes. I even started to look into men's section for interesting prints and roomy clothes. I love Amy's tips on how to look comfortable on different occasions but still put together, not sloppy.   Now when you asked, I think I really love the philosophy even more than clothes themselves. I love the suits, the knits, some of the tops. However I absolutely cannot wear the shoes, neither a sandal nor an "ironic" furry shoe because of practicality, dress code, weather. So yes, I think I am really looking for brands who share similar philosophy of creative basics.	labels:I agree, her tips on looking put together but still stylish and chic are great!   Haha, agree on the shoes! I wasn‘t trying to diss the clothes, btw. Just amazed at how she and the brand stylist Dione manage to look amazing in weird items.	episode_done:True

text:I have to say I don't see them as hard rules, but more like principles of how to understand what looks good and what looks tired/tried-too-hard. For example, the rule of having only one white thing or not wearing necklaces and earrings or similar. I think it is a way of simplifying a formula of how to dress well, rules are easy to remember. At least it is my perception of what they are saying.  Yeah, concerning affordable items... It is above my reasonable clothes budget. I don't have to look expensive for my job and I would rather splurge for a good trip, books or a course. This is pragamtism for me.	labels:I know they say they that they are not hard rules and that nobody needs to follow them, but sometimes they sound condescending when talking about things that don't work for them and that's what I don't like.	episode_done:True

text:Ellen McArthur Circular Economy Report: by 2029 Resale is expected to be bigger than Fast Fashion	labels:Psyched to hear it. I'm a huge fan of physical and online consignment stores.   Thrift stores are great and I sometimes have the energy to dig through the esoteric offerings they have, but a well-curated consignment shop, especially an independent one is great for the community, great for sellers, great for the environment and great for me. So long as store owners are conscientious when examining the pieces they accept in-store, and are reasonable when they do the pricing, I think consignment shopping is the ideal shopping experience for me. I can find excellent condition, unique pieces from a variety of brands, at different price points - at price points far below what it would cost retail.	episode_done:True

text:Ellen McArthur Circular Economy Report: by 2029 Resale is expected to be bigger than Fast Fashion	labels:Eh, I'm pretty skeptical about claims that fast fashion will die down any time soon. Especially this claim that resale will overtake it. How will that happen? Resale depends on new items being purchased. If people aren't buying as many new items, the stock at resale will drop. And if a ton of people are buying resale, the prices on the good stuff will continue to go up and result in a lot of people buying fast fashion because it's cheaper.  Fast fashion may not be high quality or eco-friendly, but it's inexpensive and offers a lot of variety, and that's always going to be in demand. Fast fashion won't die out unless a lot of governments put in strict regulations on labor and pollution and whatnot.	episode_done:True

text:Ellen McArthur Circular Economy Report: by 2029 Resale is expected to be bigger than Fast Fashion	labels:Excited about this!  Rent the Runway (clothing rentals) just partnered with ThredUp (thrifting site) to get rid of their old inventory.   RtR has a discount shop for the clothes they don't rent out anymore but it seems like they had even more inventory lying around and they handed it over to ThredUp to sell even steeper.  Add to that the great stuff happening on Postmark, Depop, Etsy, and TheRealReal, and it's awesome to be a thrifter right now. I'm glad its all expanding.  I've been doing slow fashion for a few years and a lot of my closet is now second hand which makes me happy. Idk what the trigger was for other people but when I found out that fashion is one of the biggest polluting industries in the world, it changed my whole perspective.   Also gladd that FFA is getting more behind thrifting and second hand. Yall are the best <3	episode_done:True

text:I need help with getting rid of clothes	labels:If you have the space to store your current wardrobe, then my advice to you is simply not to pressure yourself into getting rid of clothing that you're not comfortable getting rid of.  Minimalistic wardrobes are not for everybody, and you certainly wouldn't be helping anything if you were to throw away those clothes only to end up  buying replacements later.     Take the clothes that you don't think you need and set them aside, maybe in a box or the very back of your closet, and keep only your 'minimalist wardrobe' in the easily accessible location.  If, after a year, you find that you didn't really miss anything from the old collection of clothes, you won't feel as hesitant about getting rid of them.  If you have to dig a few things out of your stash, just keep them.  If you find that you've completely ransacked your stash over the course of a year, and ended up wearing everything you didn't think you needed, then, well... maybe minimalism isn't for you.	episode_done:True
text:I need help with getting rid of clothes	labels:Hi! As a stylist I get this question ALOT. For starters don't get rid of too much before buying replacements. What ends up happening is we get rid of everything without establishing what pieces we actually need.   Start with establishing your personal style. What do your want your closet/style to be? What do you want to look like on the day to day?   Next, set aside pieces that don't fit you well. If there is potential to have the piece tailored then get that done. Key here is to just set these pieces aside but dont get rid of them yet until you find a replacement just in case you HAVE to wear it again.   Lastly is shopping! Now that you have a moodboard and list of things you need you can shop to fin in the gaps and more importantly you can shop with intention!   &#x200B;  I hope that wasn't too much and was helpful haha. I'm always happy to help.

text:I need help with getting rid of clothes	labels:I very recently purged my wardrobe majorly. I ended up getting rid of lots of items that I loved in college, but they simply don’t suit me any longer as I’m finishing law school and beginning a professional career.   I kept asking myself, as I went through piece by piece, “does this have a place in my future? When I envision myself as I wish to be perceived, does this article of clothing suit that version of myself?” I don’t mean it to sound super deep lol but that helped me a lot as I navigated trying to nail down a personal style.   I got rid of SO much, and I feel great. My closet looks so nice and less cramped and chaotic. I have been slowly incorporating some versatile basics, but before I make any new purchase I make myself think out three to five different ways I could style the piece with what I already have on hand. I’m also trying to make a point to cut out most acrylic and purchase higher quality fabrics that will (hopefully) last for many years.	episode_done:True
text:I need help with getting rid of clothes	labels:If you have the space, start by taking out from your closet anything you’re considering getting rid of. Put them somewhere else (in a tote/box, or a different room, some kind of storage area). Wait for a while to actually get rid of them, a few weeks, a few months, up to you. If you don’t go searching for them in that time, you’re probably ready to get rid of them, so without opening the box, just get rid of them/donate them. If you went searching for something in that time, put it back in your closet.	episode_done:True

text:That's actually really helpful! How do you suggest finding my style? I feel like I have such a wide style that I wear (minimal, to punk, to cutesy, etc). I feel like I love all of my clothes but some go months without being worn.	labels:A more direct answer to your question, and something that may help you cull your closet, is through a lot of self reflection and analysis.   Personal style exists at the intersection of life function and self expression. Clothing is the way you define yourself to the world, but is also integral in how well you function in that world. What purposes do you need your clothing to fulfill— do you need to have good pockets? Easy movement? Hypoallergenic fabrics? Do you have a work uniform? What do you want your clothing to say about yourself to others?   Of the things in your closet right now, what do you love? Why do you love it? Is it the texture of the fabric? The construction? Certain stylistic elements? The way it fits you? Get really specific, put it on and think about the fact that you’re wearing it as you’re going about your day and how you feel in it and why.    Keep going: What do you wear all the time? Why do you wear it all the time over other things? What do you hate? Why do you hate it? What do you never wear? Why not? What clothing do you hate but wear all the time or love but never wear and why? Spend a lot of time on these questions because they’ll help you put the language to your needs and wants. When you have some answers, then you can start searching for trends amongst the things you love and the things you hate, and learning the details of clothing and construction that will best help you hone in on what you like. Review fabric composition; find your color trends; learn the names of structural elements that you see in several garments you love or hate; this will all help you seek out or avoid those better in the future.   Once you have some of those answers you can pointedly look for pieces to replace those that you hate but wear all the time with ones you love that align better with your needs or preferences, and you can cull accordingly.   Developing personal style is a journey and one in which there are no wrong answers. Your clothing should serve your wants and your needs.	episode_done:True

Minimalism isn't a virtue and it's only valuable in so much as it matches your lifestyle, needs, and desires. You don't have to aim for minimalism for the sake of minimalism, or just because it’s in style. It's ok to own things that make you happy. It's ok to only wear something once every couple of months (or less often). You don't have to get rid of things just because you are not living up to some arbitrary standard of use.
text:I just feel like I have too many clothes, and it has lead to a pretty bad laundry habit because I know I have more to wear. I'm not trying to be 100% minimalistic just trying to lower the amount of clothes I have. I'm not one to shop very often so it's not a shopping habit but I have a hard time getting rid of clothes. I know it's not wrong to have a big closet, I just want to have less. I enjoy donating clothes that I no longer have purpose for but I somehow still have a hard time getting rid of things.

When i buy them, i have to cut about 4" off the leg and hem them, so they aren't ludicrously long.  I save that fabric, and when the inner thighs get worn down i patch them from the inside.  The trousers i buy are already 2 layers on the seat and inner thigh, so once i'm down making the patch i carefully cut away the outer fabric layer that is fraying, exposing the 2nd layer with the patch all the way on the inside.    It's not perfect, but it gives me a couple years extra out of my work trousers.  The pair i have on now needs the patch installed, and i recall buying these 5 years ago.	episode_done:True

text:What do YOU do with "chub rub" jeans?	labels:I used to wear black jeans daily for work for about 8 years. A lot of that time I was broke af and spending $35 every 6 months or so on jeans was a really big purchase. I’d usually only have 1-2 pairs of work jeans at a time and wore them every day for 8-12 hours. When they ripped in the thighs I would hand sew them together very very poorly lol. I don’t know why I never looked up a tutorial or anything but the sewing would usually buy me 3-4 days until I could buy new ones.   Now that I’m more financially stable and I don’t have to wear black jeans to work, my pants tend to last a lot longer. When they wear out in the thighs/crotch I just toss them now. I no longer have to save jeans just in case I can’t fix the next pair and it’s very freeing.	episode_done:True

text:How do you shop for specific things without google clogging up with items from fast fashion? Or. How do you find the real designer of a fast fashion item?	labels:I love shopstyle for new items. Or I’ll look specifically on designer retailers (Net-A-Porter, The Outney, etc). For secondhand luxury items I prefer The RealReal or Vestiaire Collective since they authenticate all their pieces. I see a lot of knock offs on places like Poshmark and Depop unfortunately	episode_done:True
text:How do you shop for specific things without google clogging up with items from fast fashion? Or. How do you find the real designer of a fast fashion item?	labels:On Poshmark or eBay, I set a minimum price to filter out the worst of it. On eBay, you can also search specifically for pre-owned items, which might also help depending on what you're looking for. (Vestiaire and TRR have much less of it.)   I generally still get some, but it's much easier to scroll through and look for what I want.	episode_done:True
text:How do you shop for specific things without google clogging up with items from fast fashion? Or. How do you find the real designer of a fast fashion item?	labels:I’d honestly suggest using Depop or Poshmark. Most of if not all of the results are second hand so it’s less likely to be fast fashion. Fast fashion definitely makes it way in there but you can raise your price bar to around $10+ or $15+ to weed all those out.
text:What depop are *you* on? From where I'm standing, Depop is 80% fast fashion being sold for near full-price, and way more than $10 lol.	labels:Maybe I’m just good at finding the not fast fashion then	episode_done:True

text:Anyone else missing party clothes?	labels:Yes! I have like a whole drawer of what I consider to be my ‘ho’ clothes. Totally impractical for wearing out right now, but I miss doing a full face of makeup (including lipstick people could see!) and getting dressed up.  Honestly I don’t think trends move the same way with going out wear as it does in other areas of fashion. A body con dress or some fun short shorts are usually good for a couple years imo. However I’m definitely the first to admit my taste leans more towards trashy and loud than special event most times, it also gets worn to rocky horror showings pretty regularly so that’s my kinda vibe lol.   I did buy a couple of pieces at the beginning of this when I thought it would just be a few months, but since then not really. It’s been more about comfy casual since that’s what my weekend look like now.
text:Haha to be fair mine are mostly “ho” clothes too, I guess college “special events” for me have mostly been big themed parties. Right now they’re all packed away in a box under my bed to make more room since I don’t wear them as much ... very sad.

Every time I shop I see so many cute/sexy clothing that would be perfect for going out but because of COVID, I've been reluctant to buy them.

To put them to use, some of them are able to be used for layering so I try to make it a little more classy if I decide to wear it out. Usually, if I see something I like that'd be perfect for going out, I'd consider how versatile the piece might be and whether or not I could dress it up or down.  Once quarantine is over, I'm breaking out all my fancy/going out clothes and dressing myself to the 10s!	episode_done:True
text:Anyone else missing party clothes?	labels:I miss going out a lot too. My "going out" clothes can be paired with a lot of other things.

text:BOF Op-Ed: How Luxury Became Fast Fashion	labels:Luxury used to be expensive materials and construction.   But it's much more lucrative to sell "looks", "styles", and "trends". When they can't even sew on the buttons without threads sticking out of every hole, some too tight that I have to re-do myself.  I do believe that you can have luxury synthetics, but also that few brands use them. Even brands that go "ethical" and "timeless" in marketing avoid "quality" now. Because it's easy to prove quality. Using unprotected fluff-words and reputations made decades ago is much safer and can be used to inflate prices.  H&M collabs used to be amazing. I regret I didn't buy a wool jacket 5 years ago. It was a bit too expensive and heavy for me then. But the quality for price was GREAT. It did make me realize how shitty midrange clothing is.   Picking the right stuff from H&M will be better then brands that costs 5-10 times as much. It's really only the label that is different. And if H&M can't pay their worker much for that price, more expensive brands just doesn't. Why would they?  Does Amazon pay their workers more, or take out a larger profit? No one with the means of starting up international brands actually wants to offer a great product, made fairly, they want max profit. Greenwashing is great for profit, no need to prove anything, and keep selling shit that needs to be replaced after a few uses for premium prices.	episode_done:True

text:BOF Op-Ed: How Luxury Became Fast Fashion	labels:I agree with the article in the most of what added to the ‘exclusivity’ (besides the price point) if luxury brands has disappeared. I think it’s all still in the process of imploding though. These large fashion houses are all leveraging their names, which were built in times of higher exclusivity, to see diffusion lines, collaborations and perfume.   Between that and more and more designers trying to use the same trendy ideas, I’m not sure if the name recognition they have will last for much longer. I think we all know that luxury designers are shifting away from selling only luxury clothing/bags. But like if I’m going to get fast fashion quality, I’m gonna pay fast fashion prices.
text:I agree the exclusivity disappeared. I remember in high school the cool kids would drive to New York or Toronto to do back-to-school shopping to get designer clothes and accessories. By the time I graduated college, all the in-demand brands (like Michael Kors and Coach) had stores in the local mall, plus online shopping and others you mentioned.  And now that you can regularly find these and all those other "high end" brands at Marshalls, TJMax, 6pm, etc, they've lost even more of their cache.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Less likely for Stella in particular - they are (or were till at least 2019) an official reseller of those products so they were getting a lot of their inventory directly from Stella McCartney.   My gut is that there are certain products (Hermes/Gucci logo belts, Chanel quilted bags, a Burberry scarf) that are more likely to be dupes initially and it would be better to stay away from TRR and try to find it elsewhere.   TRR is currently facing several lawsuits about how they misled investors in how their authenticators are trained, Chanel also alleges that they filed off serial numbers as a practice.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:What are some habits that keep clothes/shoes new vs that habits that ruin them?	labels:This is more of a presentation tip that I read on reddit and have been doing. As soon as clothes come out of the dryer, I go through each item (including underwear and snip any loose threads, check for any loose buttons and quickly resew, and check for any pulled threads or stains that didn't come out.

text:What are some habits that keep clothes/shoes new vs that habits that ruin them?	labels:First for cardigans and sweaters is I either go fully wool or fully cotton. Can’t be any sort of blend, and I avoid mohair. I have a cotton cardigan from urban outfitters that’s like 5-6 years old and looks brand new, so you don’t even need to go super pricey, just look at fabric content.  Second is I wash everything on cold, and hang dry as often as possible. Heat basically transforms fabric, so using it is unnecessary. I also find that it sets pit stains instead of removes them.  Shoes I have no idea. I walk a lot and constantly wear out shoes. I find leather with a sewn in sole lasts a lot longer, but flats and heels never last that long. I’ve also had luck with shoes that have wooden soles which I’ve added a sole with traction to.  For bags, I’ve always heard it’s bad luck to keep them on the ground, but that’s more superstition than keeping it nice lol.

In fact, one of them managed to get “online” really fast with just instagram posts and call to order. I’m still very much supporting my local stores in that I’ll order online and pickup and try them on at home and return if it doesn’t work. I’m a bit more selective in trying clothes now in that I’ll only try things that I’m certain I will purchase if they fit. But my purchases have increased a lot due to COVID sales.	episode_done:True

text:Vogue: How Thom Browne Is Flourishing in a Pandemic (& a fun anecdote on staying true to one's self)	labels:This was a really interesting piece! I think it speaks to the power of strong branding, recognizability, and building a core customer base that his line is doing so well right now. Because honestly I can’t imagine what Thom Browne leisure collection would look like if he did try to jump on that trend! More sweaters?  I’m very much not the target customer (relaxed Bay Area and all that) but looking though the website really gives me the idea that I could be that kind of immaculately tailored prep school person. Really speaks to how strong the overall image is within the brand.  I also didn’t realize about Billy Porter’s Oscars gown. I really wanted to like it, but the proportions seemed kinda weird. Guess it makes sense now coming from a designer who’s known for odd proportions.

For the first couple months of all of this that's what I did. I was really depressed and scared, but now it's different. I've accepted the shit, and now it's time to...not move on because social distancing and wearing masks are still important, but I guess to just make do how best we can.   i've been feeling a lot more comfortable wearing weird clothes and experimenting with new things lately. i feel anonymous behind my mask, like i can get away with something i might not have been able to otherwise. and that is such a great feeling. not only is it liberating but i feel so confident and happy. i went grocery shopping last weekend in punk boots with high-waisted sparkly camo leggings and a cropped hoodie. i'd never have worn that out before! (at least maybe not during the day, and definitely not grocery shopping!!)  and it feels sort of great to feel that way now. yeah things suck but i'm wearing sparkly camo leggings right now and i feel great!  i'm hoping that when this is all over and things settle into a new normal maybe that experience will help others like it's been helping me. maybe people will be more comfortable being themselves, and feel less pressure to dress a certain way, and just do what makes them happy!	episode_done:True

The interplay between light and shadows heavily enriches the mood.	episode_done:True
text:Are LBD’s really a MUST?	labels:I'd say it's not a must. It all depends on your life and your own style. I don't have an LBD, but I do have a navy dress that I could wear to work and go out and even to weddings - with the right accessories, of course. I think that's the whole point of the LBD - it's supposed to be a "blank canvas" type of clothes that goes with everything and you can accessorize it to fit the occasion. However, if you already have enough clothes for every occasion in your life, then it's definitely not necessary to go out and buy an LBD just because it's on some list of must-haves.
text:This reminds me of Abby's blue dress from Broad City. She looks super hot in it when going out but it still looks nice when worn out to dinner!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Are LBD’s really a MUST?	labels:I think it is a must as much as the trench or the white button down - it does not necessarily work for all of us, either our lifestyles or bodies.  Trench coats were invented when people wore hats, hence no hood, and they are IMO impractical for rain compared to hooded raincoats and can drown a lot of women's bodies particularly if they are not tall. Or if they bike, or whatever.   Little black dresses were probably a fantastic idea in the 60s, where women would dress formally for the office, or go to cocktail parties afterward. Right now I think the LBD probably is good for one thing, the specific cocktail or aperos or dunno a party given by your inlaws or something. I think it is something work having - but buy it cheap and/or in sale because likely you will not wear it lots... And focus on fitting (not too tight, not too short), if you find an affordable one which fits great and you have the budget/space, worth having. But do not go all check-list getting.	episode_done:True
text:Are LBD’s really a MUST?	labels:I think it’s a must but I don’t think it has to technically be a “LBD”. As long as the color is a dark neutral like navy, burgundy, or charcoal it’s fine and a very subtle pattern or texture is okay too, like an obvious woven or tweed. As for the dress part, it could be a non-little dress or even a jumpsuit. For me, I think it’s a relief to have a go to outfit for certain situations. Here are some imaginary ones for someone your age: your boyfriend/girlfriend’s conservative parents decide to surprise visit them at school and they want to take you both to a nice restaurant for dinner tonight; you need to attend a wake for someone who passed away suddenly; you get a call that there’s a new spot open for a highly competitive summer internship and interviews are only a couple days away. In each of these scenarios, it’s so much easier to know that you have a go-to look that is always appropriate especially since some of these can be stressful without worrying about your outfit.	episode_done:True
text:Are LBD’s really a MUST?	labels:Don't be too worried about looking like everyone else, clothes aren't always about standing out. I think it's good to have a classy black dress just in case you get invited somewhere you have to dress nice. Like maybe you need to do a poster presentation for your thesis, or your org has a formal. They're easy to dress up or down depending on accessories.    Honestly, if you can't think of an occasion where you'd wear one, then you don't need one! I just like the simplicity of a black dress sometimes, esp if you have accessories that you want to emphasize.	episode_done:True
text:Are LBD’s really a MUST?	labels:Nothing is a fashion must if you’re not going to wear it. I will say I’ve found the perfect black dress for me: it has long sleeves and a subtle shimmer, and I get a lot of use out of it.	episode_done:True
text:Are LBD’s really a MUST?	labels:Black and white are too harsh on my skin so a LBD and a white blouse are pointless in my wardrobe. I have a grey linen sheath dress, an olive green a line linen dress and a navy dress with white flowers in a sateen fabric. All three of these dresses are from Target and are my go to dresses for events. The sheath dress and the navy dress have been worn to weddings, Christmas dinners,  interviews and school pictures. My green dress is my go to when I don't know what to wear and want to feel good. If you already have an interview outfit then I would consider getting a cocktail dress in a fabric and print/colour that you love. I had a coral pink lace dress that took me to weddings, graduations, fancy lunches and theatre performances until I grew out of it. I changed up the accessories and nobody commented even though it was memorable. How many dress up events happen at this point in your life? Dress for the life you have now. Also, the best time to pick up a cocktail dress seems to be around horse racing carnivals.	episode_done:True
text:Are LBD’s really a MUST?	labels:Nope.  If there’s a funeral or school- or work-related event I MUST go to, I already have a plain black suit I wear to interviews, and I can just use that. It’s serious enough.  If I’m going somewhere nice because I WANT to, I’m going to wear something I WANT to wear. I am a color fanatic, and a black dress is not on the list of things I like wearing. Black doesn’t even look good on me, anyway.	episode_done:True
text:Are LBD’s really a MUST?	labels:Nah. I bought into that, and bought the dress. And honestly never used it.  The idea of having one dress forever is ridiculous. Styles change, bodies change, tastes change.   I’m not saying buy a dress that only fits one occasion but if you buy a dress you actually like regardless of colour or style/occasion you’ll probably get more use out of it.	episode_done:True
text:Are LBD’s really a MUST?	labels:Nothing is a must.  As someone who has travelled, I can attest why such pieces that are considered "musts" exist. The LBD is a considered a "must" because it's a simple piece you can take from day to night, style up or down with accessories.  If you don't need a quick or versatile piece in your wardrobe, a LBD isn't a must because you don't need it. If dresses aren't your thing, then an LBD isn't a must because you'll never reach for it. If black is actually a colour that looks bad on you, then the LBD isn't a must either. ETC.  You have to evaluate your own needs to see if you need an LBD. In general, I'd say most women wouldn't mind wearing a dress, so an LBD (it can be another colour) is something that can get a lot of use. A simple white dress in summer is the best candidate to understand it.	episode_done:True
text:Are LBD’s really a MUST?	labels:Not a must in my opinion.  I had some black dresses a couple  of years ago and I never wore them.   What works for someone else might not be for you. Don't feel pressured to buy stuff you dislike just because someone else says you (and all other women) should.	episode_done:True
text:Thoughts on ski / apres ski style?	labels:A word of caution: My aunt (an experienced skier) wore a fashinonable all white outfit skiing one day in the 70s. She went down a trail the wrong way and got lost. It took hours for the ski patrol to find her because it was hard to see her against the snow. She thought at one point she was going to have to spend the night on the mountain which might have killed her.    Don't wear all white while skiing.

text:Thoughts on ski / apres ski style?	labels:Skiing is a strenuous sport, often done in a dangerous alpine climate. I wear technical gear: bright loose waterproof jacket and pants for visibility and mobility, wicking warm base layers, balaclavas and goggles to protect my eyes and skin, a helmet, and a backpack or fanny pack with an emergency kit.   After skiing, I strip off the outer layers and walk around in uggs, tights, and turtleneck.   You know what? I 100% blend in. I don't look better or worse than the hundreds of other people who have just come down from the mountain. This is why people specifically wear bright colors. Your party will be able to identify you at a distance from the specific colors you're wearing.   I think ski/apres ski style is to skiing what cottage core is to farming/homesteading. It's an aesthetic for people who don't actually do it.   If you like the look and aren't interested in skiing, then look into some New England heritage preppy looks. The bean boots, scandi wool sweaters, thick stretchy stirrup pants, fluffy trimmed accessories, and parkas may appeal to you. Uniqlo has some cute stuff in their recent collab that has that cozy lux vibe. Moncler and Gorsuch are some OG European ski fashion wear companies. You could look into those for inspiration.   But definitely don't try to go skiing without a waterproof pant and jacket combo. You will have a terrible time, given how much you will likely fall. (Assuming that you're a beginner.)

It's an aesthetic for people who don't actually do it.  I can agree with this.  I live 20 miles from Breck, and any person you see who has been out on the slopes are wearing fearing athletic and technical looking gear.  For most restaurants, people aren't dressed in furs or look glam at all.  It's mostly basic bitch type winter garb - knit hats with a fur pom pom, long puffer jackets, skinny jeans.    If you go to Aspen though that's a bit of a different story.  More money over there so you'll see "fancier" people.	labels:20 miles is 32.19 km	episode_done:True
text:Thoughts on ski / apres ski style?	labels: Top Apres ski pic is Aspen, isn't it? Unless every resort town has those sidewalks.  Honestly, if really unsure here, I'd look at hashtags and gallery pics from local bars to see what people are wearing.  Denim is COLD in these climates and unpleasant if you're going to be outside a lot.   I feel as if Gorsuch and Alp-n-Rock do these looks well, but yeah, expensively.

text:Thoughts on ski / apres ski style?	labels:Personally, I try to avoid the thinking of what I'm going to wear when I'm going somewhere, other than for functionality of course.  I feel like we expect our personalities and our lives to suddenly become glamorous and completely different once we get there, but that rarely happens in reality.  Same with vacation to a tropical paradise. Or a new job. Or a move unto the city. If I'm not a person that's likely to look glam, polished and picture perfect in everyday life, I won't have the energy to do so on vacation either. Plus, it's vacation, a time for me to feel relaxed and do fun stuff, not a time to focus on changing oneself to someone I'm not!  That's my thoughts! I feel like social media, selling and marketing is especially targeting in this way. When we see a product we want it, not just because it's appealing for the eye but also because we expect these things to change what we don't like about ourselves. Things we don't really want or have the energy to change ourselves, so we expect stuff to do it for us if we just buy them.
text:This 100%. I packed so many cozy apres outfits when I last went skiiing and then never at any point wanted to get into real clothes after shower. So my real apres style was just the leggings I wore skiing with technical underlayers and a big unzipped ski parka.	labels:	episode_done:True

He’s a quick-thinking guy, and I know he’ll have a good answer, so I say, “ok smart guy, what shape am I?”  “Well, you’ve got good hips and butt, and a long but slender torso. You’re male genitalia. Penis and balls.”  So, apparently I’m genitalia shaped. Sorry, that’s not a food, but it’s what I’ve got.

text:Thoughts then and now?	labels:While I can appreciate the aesthetic and social decorum norms of vintage dressing, it strikes me as a kind of sartorial MAGA.  It is a nostalgic viewpoint that largely ignores the social and political structures tied to it. There are a lot of reasons people don't dress up on a daily basis anymore, including:  * women aren't relegated to being homemakers anymore * a woman's value is no longer solely attributed to her appearance * people's lives are a lot more complicated and multifaceted than they were before * people move around a lot more than they did before * people face greater economic pressures that before * lifestyles and social values, in general, have changed  While there will always be social/cultural expectations that dictate what is appropriate to wear in a given situation, it is generally a good thing that we now have more freedom of choice in what to wear on a daily basis.
text:Yeah definitely society’s views have shifted in the past  7 years or so. What strikes me was the comments responding to the article more so than the article itself. I’ve only looked at this subreddit for the past year or so but the attitude seemed so different, where for before they downright agreed. Now people mainly keep to themselves and try not to cast judgements on what people wear. Which I certainly feel is much more freeing. Thanks for the response.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Thoughts then and now?	labels:I know that for me and some people I’ve talked to, the concern is that people might interpret you as vain, flamboyant, or obnoxiously rich. Obviously being rich isn’t a bad thing, but pushing it in people’s faces is.  At my last office when I wore nice heels and cardigans I’d get attitude from other women basically saying they were more evolved or had more important things to do in their lives so they didn’t bother with heels, or implying that I was anti feminist. Some people made comments about my “not understanding challenges, etc”. I’d also get extra attention from men which is great, but not at work. To be clear I’m not even talking about my usual over the top style. I’m talking about office friendly Zara and Uniqlo with the pieces put together in a thought out way. It was a toxic office but, some just are.  A lot of people paint dressing down as something you do for comfort because you’re practical, hardworking, have important things to do, more than your appearance, modern, not shallow, etc so sometimes the criticism is that you’re not those things if you like to dress up and that can be really damaging.  In college I dressed nicely to class for a few semesters. It was a small school and when I had difficulty in a subject, it was heavily implied that I was having trouble because I was too focused on my appearances (I wasn’t. I just was thoughtful in my purchases and find dresses more comfy). Started wearing leggings and jeans and T-shirt’s and was taken more seriously when I said I was working hard.  When I went to the doctor dressed up they wouldn’t take my symptoms as seriously as when I dressed down.  It’s stupid and judgey and goes to show how many people don’t know anything about clothes. (Ie. It takes no effort to dress well if you’re thoughtful in buying them) but it’s a sentiment that exists in some places and it’s challenging to deal with.
text:I generally feel that in certain situations people should not consider others dressing up or dressing down, instead perhaps they are just dressed however they feel comfortable. I definitely feel more productive and focused when I wear clothes I consider nice, It’s not about attention or showing off at all. It’s just routine. Thanks for the reply.	labels:Same. If I wear trousers I feel uncomfortable and keep adjusting all day. I just feel more comfortable and myself in the “fancy” clothes I wear which makes it easier to work and get stuff done. To everyone their own and it’s just habit.	episode_done:True
text:Thoughts then and now?	labels:Love that old post. Thanks for linking!   To me, it’s not as much about dressing up or down as it is about design. I have seen a lot of articles about the heightened attitudes towards “design,” which is a pretty general term, but to me it starts with the era where Apple was being criticized for hiring more designers than engineers. In my opinion, a LOT of products could use more/better designers, including fashion.   Maybe it’s the “hard times” mentality of my generation (millennial), buy the fundamental question of design (full disclosure, I do not work in design) is “What is the problem I’m solving?” In my opinion, a lot of clothing fails to meet the basic expectations of utility. See, for example, my impossible quest to find summer dresses appropriate for Texas heat!   I hope that the dressing up/down discussions we are having will lead us towards clothes that are better designed for the realities of our lives.
text:I understand, currently in my area there is a lot of cropped tops, sweaters, and jackets that’s flooding the markets and stores. It reminds me of when people could only buy those low waisted pants albeit it’s probably easier to find something you prefer now.	labels:I think of my grandmother who I love discussing fashion with. She absolutely despises my Birkenstocks. But if she is wearing heels or fashion sandals with flat cardboard soles she is limited on how far she can walk and what she can do. Whereas I converted to Birks after lots of travel because they are good in heat and can handle walking long distances, whether it’s across a city or a mountain! As a rule I don’t buy shoes unless I could walk three miles in them.   I think people are looking for something similar now where they want their clothes to fit a few purposes: comfort, style, and maybe work too. I loved another person’s post in another thread about going back to business casual: “who are we really kidding?”	episode_done:True

text:"Can people just hate fashion again" - Synecdoche When Talking about the "Industry" Discussion	labels:> Should spaces & industries for fashion lovers, clothes lovers, and people that have to wear clothes be completely separate?  I don’t think that any of these groups should be completely separate however I do find them all being lumped into the same spaces very frustrating as someone who does love fashion as a form of art and creativity.  I like harsh and blunt constructive criticism in pretty much all areas of life and I most certainly want it for my outfits as well. I want to hear what other fashion lovers and artists think of my colour choices, proportions, textures, fit, etc. and be able to refine those things and really flex my creative muscles when creating an outfit. Instead, many fashion spaces are dominated by ‘you do you hun!’ and ‘so long as you like it, that’s all that matters!’ which is great for someone *who has to wear clothes* and doesn’t actually care about fashion but joins fashion spaces because they feel some obligation as a woman to care about it but... those spaces just become unhelpful and bland for those who really love fashion and want to get better at it.

Bad takes of runway shows or industry inside baseball are easy enough to gloss over, but poor critique actively inhibits people's learning.   If anything, "You do you"-type comments are _even worse_ for people who are only involved out of a sense of obligation; clothing is non-verbal communication, and if you're attempting to portray a certain image you want to make sure it's perceived properly. I frequently interview people who show up in outfits that don't convey an appropriate message (e.g. wearing a suit when it's explicitly called out to not do so in our interviewing materials).  > I’ve been an off and on follower of FFA for a few years and I feel like it’s definitely dominated by the “people who wear clothes” group and unfortunately it limits the amount of critique that is acceptable to give.

I agree, I think this sub is made up of people who enjoy looking at clothes or just want to know how to dress appropriately for work & school. There's a few subjects *related* to the industry as a whole that people are passionate about, like sustainability & ethics, but I don't think this sub is able to appreciate fashion as a form of art.   I agree that a *you do you* isn't very helpful. If someone specifically asks for constructive criticism, they want feedback from people with an eye for detail. If it looks like their blazer or pants need to be tailored a bit, then let them know if they're seeking constructive criticism.	labels:	episode_done:True

They're both super comfortable and soft. Great amount of colors.  I also really like the organic cotton long sleeve from Organic Basics ($45). SUPER soft. Like crazy soft. (If you do order one of their long sleeve tops, size up...My first order I got my usual size and wow that was a mistake! Lol) they don't have a great amount of colors unfortunately...  NAADAM is also a great place to get cashmere. They're ethical/sustainable and pretty reasonably priced for cashmere items. I have about 5 of their $75 cashmere sweaters and one that is $125. Totally cute, warm, and comfortable! Lots of colors to choose from as well!  I also have quite a few long sleeve tops from Target...I am trying not to buy A New Day long sleeve fitted tops ($10)..but they're pretty decent for the price. Fun colors also.	episode_done:True

I prefer 3/4 length sleeves and these are the perfect length, they come in cute colour combinations, and look good with jeans or leggings.

They allow me to actually wear my lighter flannels and other "spring" items like trench coats without freezing. My style tends towards more "tailored" than "cozy" so these are super helpful, but they go great under sweatshirts as well!  Nowadays with the pandemic, I have ended up wearing lounge wear way more often than I normally would have and it's surprised me how different they can feel with longer-term wear! In the past I just kind of thought that a sweatshirt is a sweatshirt, they're so baggy anyway so what does it matter. But now I have a very clear preference. My favourite sweatshirts are definitely Roots, they retain that "coziness" for much longer than my other ones. My Forever 21 ones turned stiff pretty quickly, which wasn't surprising. My H&M ones also turned stiff and kept getting skinnier and skinnier, and I swear it wasn't me gaining weight lol. My Nike ones also got skinnier, but it didn't turn stiff or lose colour, and the zipper kept its shape well.   My favourite tee shirts are actually my old American Apparel ones, they somehow managed to get more cozy with every wash without going ratty, although the screen-print is fading. Although I'm aware that the management of AA (or Los Angeles Apparel now) have justifiably raised questions around ethics and bigotry, so it's up to the individual whether you're comfortable with their products.	episode_done:True

text:Tips for easily looking more modern/in style?	labels:I've heard the advice to buy 5 low-cost pieces of clothing that is in fashion per season to keep up with trends. Obviously if you see something more expensive that you love then feel free to go for it but my main point being that it doesn't have to be an entire new wardrobe of high priced clothing, it can literally be £50-100 at H&M 4 times a year buying pieces that slot into your existing wardrobe (e.g. a top or a coat or a pair of shoes). If a certain style becomes precious to you then you can always upgrade that piece.  Like for example skinny jeans are not quite the fashion of the moment but you'd still look pretty current if you paired them with a puff sleeve top. Sleek white trainers are not as on trend as some of the chunkier clunky dad styles in white but they'd still look OK with your slightly frumpy prairie dress.	episode_done:True
text:Tips for easily looking more modern/in style?	labels:I would recommend updating your "fashion basics" like plain t-shirts and jeans first because then more unique pieces will just look unique, not outdated. For instance, consider a black t-shirt with jeans. Ten ish years ago you might have a vneck tshirt and boot cut mid wash jeans, five years ago probably skinny jeans in a darker wash and a slim crew neck, and now maybe a square neck bodysuit with light wash straight jeans. But on the other hand if you have some kind of, I don't know, cool bomber jacket, it doesn't really look out of date especially because thrifting is in right now.	episode_done:True
text:Tips for easily looking more modern/in style?	labels:Depends on what you have, what you like. Assuming you have basics you like, the easiest and quickest way to "modernize" is to get one top or bottom in the shape or color of the season, and a pair of shoes.  Right now loafers are having a moment, extra modern is ones with chunkier soles. Chunky knit tops are having a moment, particularly cardigans. So you can get a chunky knit cardigan, chunky loafers, and pair with jeans and you are more "current."   Or you can swap your normal jeans with a straight legged faux leather trouser and those same loafers.   I like to follow sites like Coveteur, Who What Wear, or the Zoe Report and read their trend roundups and adopt accordingly (for me that means after I have vetted it is the sort of trend I would like.)	episode_done:True

text:Tips for easily looking more modern/in style?	labels:Hi,  I think you have to consider what is modern in your country/area/city if your goal is to appear modern. Eg tight leather pants and overknee boots were quite modern where I live 1-2 years ago but they would seem outdated now, but I still see them on instagram in other countries.  But generally, for a vibe, I would look at early seasons of friends (monika!) and fashionable movies and music videos (eg don't speak!) from the early to mid 90s for silhouettes, trouser cuts and articles of clothing you can add to your wardrobe. Other posters already got more detailed so I'll skip that.  Also I think looking at the websites of fashion forward brands like Zara and Monki help with finding out whats modern in terms of silhouettes, combinations and color stories without having to necessarily buy from them.
text:Thank you for the tips!!! I havent really shopped from monki before but imma go check it out!	labels:hey, sorry for the late reply! Monki is really nice for inspiration, but the product quality is somewhat lacking. I still shop there, because they are one of the few stores with a good waist to hip ratio for me (not everyone is an hourglass or a pear shape. haha)	episode_done:True

text:ModCloth Returns to “Independent” Ownership	labels:I grew out of the ModCloth aesthetic, but still own a red dress with a Peter Pan collar which I called my “power dress.” I wore it whenever I needed “good luck” and was convinced I needed it to ace a test or give a good presentation at work. I even wore it on my first date with my (now) husband! Although it feels too young for me now, I still keep it in the back of my closet 😊 Thanks for reminding me that ModCloth existed - good memories!	episode_done:True
text:ModCloth Returns to “Independent” Ownership	labels:I always want to want to love ModCloth but they’re so expensive and so *inconsistent*. You knew how things were going to fit or what the quality was. I know things came from all over designer wise so it’s hard to really control for size that way but it was still frustrating as the consumer. Post Walmart acquisition the quality absolutely went down and their pieces really lost that kinda retro funk they were known for. I still pop by once in awhile, maybe things will turn around for them again	episode_done:True
text:ModCloth Returns to “Independent” Ownership	labels:I still buy a lot of ModCloth stuff for work, it's not all cutesy. I have a lot of really good wardrobe staples and so many work dresses from there. Basically, anytime I'm buying new, I go to ModCloth, but that's only once or twice a year. Everything else I thrift	episode_done:True
text:ModCloth Returns to “Independent” Ownership	labels:Reading through the comments it really seems like Modcloth's problem has been consistency of quality all along, and not just since the Walmart takeover. I personally used to shop the website a lot, (especially for quirky jewelry and accessories!) and while I have a soft spot for many of those pieces (especially the blazer I mentioned under another comment) now that I'm really sitting here thinking about it there were def others that didn't last well or look as good in person. I also started thinking about how at that age pretty much all my income was disposable (living at home, no kids) so I guess it didn't bother me as badly if something wasn't worth what I paid for it, especially if it was cute enough to make an outfit with once or twice. So maybe the real issue with the site is its failure to adapt to its customer base's changing needs. Or, alternatively, to attract new and younger customers by staying on trend. I think there's probably a market for quirky but still trendy pieces , but a "vintage" aesthetic is a hard sell when thrifting is much more common now (not to mention cheaper and more responsible).	episode_done:True
text:ModCloth Returns to “Independent” Ownership	labels:1. I'm ambivalent. Tbh, I've been ambivalent about the ownership both pre and post WalMart. I have a lot of friends and family in the Pittsburgh area, which was one of the places where ModCloth is based, and there was a big trend of hiring young grads then mass layoffs. I don't love that in a company.  2. I love the old Modcloth aesthetic. I feel like in the past couple years its lost its vision of what it is or who its customer is. I'm having flashbacks to the awkward 80s officewear that was in all the ads a season or two ago. \*shudders\* But my older Modcloth clothes were all decent quality, with pockets in dresses, and the fit and flare dress aesthetic is very flattering on my body type. I still have quite a few ModCloth pieces, even after changing sizes since my ModCloth heyday, and they are still some of my favorite items that I own. 3. I hope so. But to survive, they're going to have to take a hard look at who their target customer is, and build a vision for themselves as a brand that fits that. And they should be better to their employees, because if you want to build a quirky and fun brand, you want to have all the institutional knowledge you can get to help your business grow. 4. ModCloth in its early days was so good at appealing to quirky but classy customers. People who wanted clothes that were good quality, had a unique aesthetic, had pockets, and were size-inclusive. I think that if ModCloth could embrace the "quirky but high quality" niche that it would grow and retain loyal customers. Brands lose customers when they hit that point where the quality goes downhill but the prices stay the same. And it would be even better if there would also be a focus on ethical and sustainable clothing that still fits the ModCloth vibe, kind of like Madewell but make it vintage.	episode_done:True
text:ModCloth Returns to “Independent” Ownership	labels:ModCloth is so sentimental for me lol. I was in high school when the twee fashion craze was really in its peak, and as a wannabe blogger I was all about ModCloth’s dresses and jewelry. I still love quirky pieces so I check their stuff out from time to time, but the quality seems like it’s really gone down since I was getting dresses for Christmas as a teenager.	episode_done:True
text:ModCloth Returns to “Independent” Ownership	labels:I loved Modcloth, I bought most of my clothes from there. After the Walmart take over I ordered two dresses to test the waters. The zippers were made out of plastic and broke right away, the stitching was off and both dresses were really underwhelming in person.  I was tempted and ordered a sweatshirt on sale a few months ago and it was made out of the worst and cheapest feeling fabric I've ever encountered. In their defense, they refunded me for all three of the items. I just don't think they're worth another shot.	episode_done:True
text:Are our ideas about what looks “dated” on either ourselves or others affected by or correlated with our age?	labels:Yes, I do think our age definitely affects what looks dated to our eye.

Also, I’ve seen shirt and shorts sets on rappers made out of wild print fabrics exactly like the ones I made for my toddler 25 years ago.  I’m older, so I’ve seen a lot of trends come and go. We are now at the point where they are starting to repeat and are designated as “Vintage”.  I have cultivated my personal style over many years (boho/western), and have seen it done well by Ralph Lauren and most recently Christian Dior in 2018(?) and enjoy the idea of wearing the beautiful things I’ve collected until the end of my life.

text:Right now, the current trend seems to be vintage/nostalgia. It's not just in fashion. Music is another easy example of this current trend, too.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Are our ideas about what looks “dated” on either ourselves or others affected by or correlated with our age?	labels:I think there might be some correlation. First of all the older we get the less likely we are to try new things and I am sure that affects clothing too. But that does not mean that 40 year olds can't wear trends just because some of their age group don't.   I remember my mother sometimes saying that certain things have a grandma vibe for her or look dated. But for me it was something completely different, because I was not around when those styles were popular the first time (or I was a litle kid) so they don't remind me of that. And it's also obvious that I could not have bought it at that time and just never threw it out, because I am too young. So I guess some pices might look dated on a 40 year old, but not on a 20 year old.  On the other hand, I have no problem with older clothes if they are paired with other pieces that are more trendy. There is no reason to throw away your favorite sweater just because it's older than 5 years. Some pieces are classics.	episode_done:True
text:Are our ideas about what looks “dated” on either ourselves or others affected by or correlated with our age?	labels:I’m going to go one further and say weight also has to do with it.

The more you deviate from the social “ideal,” whether that’s age, weight, or anything else, the less favorably some people will look at whatever you do because of their ageist, fatphobic, etc biases. There are definitely other factors this applies to, such as race, socioeconomic class, having “bad” teeth, and many more, but I’ve already written a novel here and I feel like you guys get the picture.

text:Are our ideas about what looks “dated” on either ourselves or others affected by or correlated with our age?	labels:For me (almost 34), I think it's the progression of time seems to have sped up. It's like, I buy a pair of designer jeans (an investment!) and get a good season out of them. I love them. Then I get pregnant and have to do maternity clothes for almost a year (barf). Then post partum changes your body and I just miss my old clothes. I can't fit in them so miss another season. By the time you lose the weight and can fit in your favorite jeans, it's summer. Okay, I'll wait for fall. Fall comes and apparently the waist height is dated? That's bullshit, you JUST bought them.. 3 years ago. That doesn't feel like that long ago.  It was the same with some over the knee boots I bought 5yrs ago. Beautiful leather. I wore them one season, then pregnancy changed my shoe size. Then the post partum phase I was always bending over and on the floor, things over the knee boots did not do well. I needed slip ons. Okay. The next 3 years and two more kids, can't wait till I'm back in the life phase where I can wear my boots! Except now they're 'dated'. Again, total bullshit. Shoes should be fashionable for that period of time. Ugh, I'm wearing them anyway.   Just my theory. I'm currently super frustrated by t shirt lengths. I can't keep my jeans and buy new t-shirts. I now need to update all my jeans or show an awkward amount of stomach. I'll do it, but I'm going to be old and grumpy while I do it.	episode_done:True
text:Are our ideas about what looks “dated” on either ourselves or others affected by or correlated with our age?	labels:I think that as we age, we have more responsibilities crowding in that can push out time for staying current with fashion, unless we make intentional choices to carve out that time.  I also think that our fashion circles change as we age - it’s not natural to be surrounded by whatever is trendy for people in their teens - early 20s. I’m 33 and work in academia - the students I teach have a very different perception of what is trendy/cool than I do, and I would assume that a lot of that has to do with the influencers and social media we consume.  There was a discussion here a few weeks ago about Gen Z vs Millennial fashion, and I was cracking up - I am pretty fashionable in my same-age friend set, but a lot of the comments from the Gen Z participants described items that look “old” to them that I still wear regularly.   I think the other piece of this is pairing. Most items that cycle back around in style may be older items, but they have to be styled differently than they were the first time to look fresh (*cough Doc Martens cough*). If someone styles a currently trendy item the same way they did 10-20 years ago, it will probably look dated even if the item itself is trendy.   Finally, as we age, I think we stop thinking of fashion as one of the only ways we can communicate who we are to the world. When I was 22, I cared a lot more about what my clothes said about me because I didn’t yet have many professional/personal accomplishments. Now, I care a lot less. Style is a enjoyable hobby for me so I still think about my clothes, but more as a way to have fun - at this point, I’ve built somewhat of a professional reputation for myself and my clothes don’t need to have such a prominent voice to others.	episode_done:True
text:Are our ideas about what looks “dated” on either ourselves or others affected by or correlated with our age?	labels:>Do you think there’s an age where the concept of what looks “dated” changes? This has been on my mind a lot and a comment in the “what will be obsolete” thread played into it - someone said that skinny jeans will vanish... except on women around or over 40.  Some women kind of freeze their style in their 30s or even 20s. I am not sure why though. But I have friends who are like fussy children eating, they want just this or that precise cut. I think it is fun to try stuff just to try it out but no they want precise duplicates or very similar items to what they had. I think a lot of women can kind of research "flattering" for their body type or coloring (that horrible season theory...) and then it is like they graduated it, no more thinking about it, they stick to the rules they know. With a friend of mine it is massive list. I try to not push things at people, but once it was fun to see her revelation that OK, yes, horizontal stripes do look good on her (and she bought it and wore it lots) just because she thought she knew she was too heavy to wear stripes (no.... depends width, cut but it can look very nice).  I think datedness is a thing in general for every item, everything kind of is in an environment and we can not even see details which seem so obvious and only right way to do something but which will change in a few years. But unless something is too extreme, often there is ways to wear different waist lines, different pant width or hemlines, different things more timelessly. It helps though if the whole outfit is blended, if the shoes or bag or other pieces are more modern...  Getting a piece in a new trend, and combining it with older pieces can produce a lot of very different "new" right-now outfits.	episode_done:True

The more you deviate from the social “ideal,” whether that’s age, weight, or anything else, the less favorably some people will look at whatever you do because of their ageist, fatphobic, etc biases. There are definitely other factors this applies to, such as race, socioeconomic class, having “bad” teeth, and many more, but I’ve already written a novel here and I feel like you guys get the picture.
text:I was about to say! The reason I'm not buying "mom jeans" is because they're going to make me look like exactly that--a frumpy mom, not a cool, hip 20-something who is wearing them ironically and who has a body that looks good even if the clothes aren't flattering.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Are our ideas about what looks “dated” on either ourselves or others affected by or correlated with our age?	labels:I absolute love this topic and can’t wait to start and finish a 2 hour zoom meeting so i can come read all of the comments!!   I spoke with a friend about this a year or two ago. We were seeing a lot of the youths (we’re in our early 30s) wearing baggy jeans and skinny glasses and i just proclaimed “honestly, I’m off the fashion and trends wagon. My idea of what is flattering isn’t going to change. I like a skinny jean with a high waist to accentuate my proportions and I’ll be that outdated old lady in Levi’s 721s for as long as they make them.” (I’m wearing 721s as i type this!)   So I’m sure there are a lot of factors but i can only speak for the ones i feel influenced by. I have an image of what is flattering in my mind as molded by my time and place in the world. I have an image for what qualifies as “classic” and “timeless” built from the same culture. The youths are and will always come up in different times and places and they will eventually recognize me as the aged and tired woman that i am and that’s fine. May they speak kindly of my hair and makeup choices always as they will someday be gawked at and mocked as well.    I’d love to know what we elder millennials and x-gen’ers would list as “dated” that wouldn’t come to mind for late teens and early twenty-somethings! I think of outfits that are too matchy-matchy (belt, purse, and shoes look like they were sold as a set; eyeshadow and lipstick both match the blouse; earrings and necklace have the same charm), heels that are blocky and /or white, hairspray, visible and neutral socks, and bulky/shapeless knits (shoulder pads; scratchy looking yarn; stiff and puffy shapes).   But am i so old that i don’t realize the younger people haven’t even witnessed these things in the wild or in the movies? Do they think side-swept bangs are our shoulder pads? Someone please bridge this gap in the convo because I’m fascinated.	episode_done:True
text:How different is your actual heel length vs what it's advertised as and, how much does it change by shoe size for you?	labels:I don’t have an example right now but want to thank you for posting this as I have never considered this! I’m a US6 and have NO IDEA how some women frequently wear 3 inch heels. The super steep arch was so uncomfortable. This makes so much sense!
text:Seems size 6 is a 50/50 size for a lot of people given the standard size is made for bigger feet. I have a few friends that wear a US size 6 and it's basically split down the middle between if they'll find the same shoe comfortable or not.  One of my friends revealed that she is SUPER flat footed so, even 2 inch heels can give her problems as a result even if it's a thick heel or a wedge style. Some of them were also just buying low quality shoes since they didn't want to spend a lot of money and then when they got better quality pairs, their shoes hurt far less. Quality definitely matters a lot.  Something as simple as the incline (outright influences the slope steepness) is a game changer as well. Not to mention ankle and nerve strength differing between two individuals. There's so many factors into why shoes are comfortable or uncomfortable for us but, it definitely appears most are unaware of the heel slope steepness and shoe size factors.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:How different is your actual heel length vs what it's advertised as and, how much does it change by shoe size for you?	labels:I’m so happy you posted this. People keep suggesting that I wear taller heels as I’m 5’0”, but my size 5 feet can’t handle much over 2 inches.	episode_done:True
text:How different is your actual heel length vs what it's advertised as and, how much does it change by shoe size for you?	labels:If the heel height is graded for size the angle of the footbed should remain constant between sizes.   IME wearer weight, fitness, and tolerance for discomfort play a more significant role than anything else. I’m 176cm, IT38, wear heels more than is probably good for me, and can comfortably manage a 100-105mm pump sans platform to dinner, and 85mm or so for days at the office if needed. With an enclosed wedge or block heel style I can easily do ten miles of walking at the same height, more with alcohol ;) I’m a former rock climber and lifelong endurance athlete, so discomfort and chafing are not foreign to me. Even the worst heel is much more comfortable than trying to jam a thin crack! I have former dancer friends who report a similar experience, while other less grin-and-bear-it types find anything more constrictive than Uggs unbearable.   I drop weight in the late summer and early fall for races, and even the 2-3kg shift makes a huge difference in comfort.	episode_done:True
text:How different is your actual heel length vs what it's advertised as and, how much does it change by shoe size for you?	labels:Size US11 here! Wearing heels is a breeze for me, personally, even if I'm over 6 feet tall in them! .. never thought about it this way, though. Makes a lot of sense that smaller feet would have greater strain while wearing heels. And yes, it is hell finding shoes my size. I usually wear men's sneakers. I only own two pairs of heels, and I'd say they're both about 4 inches tall.	episode_done:True
text:How different is your actual heel length vs what it's advertised as and, how much does it change by shoe size for you?	labels:I can't offer any help, but I just want to say that I hate how the heel height is measured from under the sole, when the footbed might actually slope up another full inch from there to the back of the heel. I'm only comfortable in heels up to about 4" max, and I don't order online bc they're always taller than I think from the measurements posted!	episode_done:True
text:How different is your actual heel length vs what it's advertised as and, how much does it change by shoe size for you?	labels:Something I’d like to point out, as a former dancer (yes, that kind of dancer), who spent several years wearing various heel heights:  In my experience, the slope and comfort of a shoe is partly dependent upon the height of the platform. The higher the platform, the less of an impact a high heel makes.  Both of the shoes in your photo have a thick platform. I think it would be helpful to deduct the height of the platform from the height of the heel, as that would give you a truer measure of the impact of the heel height.	episode_done:True
text:How different is your actual heel length vs what it's advertised as and, how much does it change by shoe size for you?	labels:pointed this out to my husband once when he bragged about wearing 4” heels with no problem, so why couldn’t I? Yeah buddy, it‘s simple geometry, look at the extreme angle of my size 6 foot with my heels raised four inches above the floor, and then look at yours with your size 13 feet. It’s fascinating how many things shoe designers need to take into consideration!	episode_done:True
text:Excercises for personal style	labels:>I am womdering if there are some techniques or excercises we can complete together for a more authentic version of herself.  Be careful yourself.  I am a bit wary of the concept of people developing confidence and helping friends develop other (different) styles. Style confidence is really personal. And assigning exercises, is a bit "teacher" like, wisdom dripping from above, chore like.   Friends might need help, but also to preserve friendships, it is often to always remember "you do you" and couch advice carefully and always understand people have different styles, different taste, and it is also OK to not actually CARE about style or fashion.	episode_done:True
text:Excercises for personal style	labels:Friends helped me narrow my style over the years. The most important is knowing what Looks Good on you. I love many pieces that don't fit my body. Someone had to help me by pointing out things that look bad & good. I also dressed way too conservatively for my shape and situations. They had to help show me - it's ok:)   Now I'm confident in my choices and help others. A clue that you're on the right track is when people compliment what you are wearing- not just what it is but how the color/style suits  you. Or the way you put it together. Complimenting other people is not only a nice, decent thing to do, it's also a good way to get them talking about clothes/styles/etc.	episode_done:True
text:Excercises for personal style	labels:I started making a personal style guide for myself last year, and it's an ever-evolving thing. I listed different eras of inspiration (1950s, 1960s, etc.), style icons (real and fictional) and describing various vibes. I also wrote out which physical attributes I want to highlight (and which ones I didn't), as well as listed wardrobe things I wanted and outlined a shopping strategy.  I told a friend about this, and now she's adopted it for herself! I feel like it's a great way to analyze what you want your style to be for yourself.	episode_done:True

For example, if  Person A wanted to be perceived as confident, they would ask themselves if the article of clothing or whatever fit inside the "confident" bubble.  I found that idea to be useful. So the first step is choosing your keywords, and then considering them when you shop or dress yourself.

text:I'm reading this at the moment!  A lot of the ideas on it aren't completely new to me though. Justine Leconte has a video on YouTube about finding your style that touches on similar themes without being so labour-intensive and detailed. I also got a free PDF of Rachel Nachmias's The Face of the Business by subscribing to her newsletter a while ago and that has exercises that also overlap, although I abandoned it when it got too business-focused.  (Edit: I also meant to mention the Everyday Style podcast. I can't remember if she does it for all episodes but in earlier ones she gives "homework" exercises that could be relevant.)  Anyway, they're some options that could be useful alternatives if The Curated Closet is tricky to get a copy of. I also think Justine is really sweet and worth watching generally :-)	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What are your favorite, trusted clothing lines for buying wear-forever investment classics?	labels:For cashmere specifically, you should try Pringle of Scotland, Johnston of Elgin, and Agnona on resell sites. They are top tier cashmere brands but not " well known" like Brunello Cuccinelli or Loro Piana. Brora is also very good quality but their styles can be a little "JC Penny" or "Kohls” catalog. I don't know how you describe it, but yeah.  Otherwise, what immediately came to mind for me is Adam Lippes. It's insanely expensive, up there with your “fashion house designers” but unlike those, it's not super well known and not an "it-brand" so there's not a lot of fakes floating around. I thrift it off of Ebay, the RealReal, and occasionally discount sites and never worry about authenticating it the way I would for say, Chanel, Dior, Gucci, Prada etc. I'm no stranger to designer goods but their material and construction is absolutely amazing. Like the highest quality, weightiest fabric you can imagine. Honestly you could wear their shirts inside out because the hems are finished so perfectly, it'd be hard to tell.   Another one that I love that I NEVER hear of is Petar Petrov. What that brand does with silk is frankly incredible. The colors and cuts (especially their very flattering body skimming bias cuts) are stunning in person and nothing like any kind other designer I’ve ever seen. Again pricey pricey, but not popular/not high in demand so a diligent online shopper could thrift it more easily.  Sometimes even with truly luxury designer, I feel like the consumer is paying for the logo-bling, design and but necessarily quality. But these two luxury brands are IMO consistently both design and quality and no visible logos.
text:Johnston of Elgin is fantastic! I visited the factory while in Scotland and it was so fascinating to see how their goods are made. I got a few sweaters and a hat while there, and it’s been two years with very minor pilling (nothing a shaver couldn’t put right quickly) and lots of wear.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:What's your fashion miracle?	labels:I used to wear small diamond earrings every day, and would put them in my wallet when I went to the gym after work. I got to work the next day and realized I forgot to put them back in after the gym, so I opened up my wallet and they were gone. I had made my usual morning stop for breakfast on the way to work, so I rushed to the food cart and looked all over the sidewalk but I couldn’t find them.  At least 1-2 weeks later I went to the same food cart for breakfast, looked down, and saw one diamond earring in the crack in the sidewalk. I looked more closely and there was the other one! The metal was chewed up (they were bezel set) so I had to get them repaired, but it was a lot cheaper than a new pair!   Definitely my #1 fashion (jewelry?) miracle.
text:I'm glad you found them! This reminds me of my mother's similar miracle with her wedding ring! Her ring is not fancy, it has a single, small round diamond in a gold 6-prong setting.   Well, the stone fell out at some point, and my mother didn't know exactly where or when. We all looked everywhere, but how do you even start to look for something that's only a few mm? We scoured the house with flashlights looking for any sparkle. We even cut open the vacuum bag and sifted through everything, same everytime someone swept or dusted. Replacing it was not an expense my parents could really afford.   A few weeks later she'd given up and had decided it would have to be replaced somehow...until she noticed a small sparkle on the [very narrow] back rim of the top loading washer by the hinge of the lid. No clue how it didn't just fall into the washer when she put the clothes in! My best guess is it fell out of a pocket and that's where it landed.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:I was on vacation with my parents and grandma when I noticed one of my ruby earrings was missing. It was probably one of the most expensive pieces of jewelry I owned and I was so upset and searched the hotel for days all over and couldn’t find it. One of the night my mom’s snoring was bugging me so much I decided to sleep in the bathroom and I put a towel down and was lying on the floor listening to music. It was like 3 am when I noticed something shiny.

text:What's your fashion miracle?	labels:Well I just got a new job that is more corporate (worked in software office previously), and I needed a fashion update. I’m sure it’s not everyone’s style, but I found a bunch of basically new stuff at a thrift shop for $2 a piece the other day: an Eileen Fisher silk undershirt, 2 Eileen Fisher all-wool pants, 2 Pendleton blazers, 1 pair of Pendleton slacks, an all-wool Valerie Stevens jacket, a cashmere shrug, a virgin wool sweater, an angora sweater, and 2 pashmina scarves. I also found 2 pairs of life strides heels in my size for $.50 each. It was a good day.   But that’s not all!   I popped in to the mall after, and the New York & Company was closing. Everything was 70-90% off. Normally I wouldn’t shop there because of the quality / age target, but they had a decent collection of accompanying items I could wear with nice blouses. Got 2 ginormous sacks of clothes for about $200. About 10 pairs of pants, 3 pairs of shoes, 2 earring sets, 3 blazers, 4 cardigans, 2 dresses, and 5 tops. Noice.  I was really worried I’d need to spend a fortune on updating my wardrobe. I was so relieved I caught a break.

I’m sure it’s not everyone’s style, but I found a bunch of basically new stuff at a thrift shop for $2 a piece the other day: an Eileen Fisher silk undershirt, 2 Eileen Fisher all-wool pants, 2 Pendleton blazers, 1 pair of Pendleton slacks, an all-wool Valerie Stevens jacket, a cashmere shrug, a virgin wool sweater, an angora sweater, and 2 pashmina scarves. I also found 2 pairs of life strides heels in my size for $.50 each. It was a good day.   But that’s not all!   I popped in to the mall after, and the New York & Company was closing. Everything was 70-90% off. Normally I wouldn’t shop there because of the quality / age target, but they had a decent collection of accompanying items I could wear with nice blouses. Got 2 ginormous sacks of clothes for about $200. About 10 pairs of pants, 3 pairs of shoes, 2 earring sets, 3 blazers, 4 cardigans, 2 dresses, and 5 tops. Noice.  I was really worried I’d need to spend a fortune on updating my wardrobe. I was so relieved I caught a break.

text:What's your fashion miracle?	labels:I purchased a gorgeous silk baby pink button up. I thought I bought it in a petite small but I accidentally got a petite large. Too big!

text:What's your fashion miracle?	labels:I passed on buying "THE" Zara dress last summer because where I am the markup is crazy, I tried it on but ultimately decided I couldn't justify the equivalent of around €60 for shit material, and it's not like Zara's poor business practices are a secret.  Recently, I started thinking about it again, how it would be great for work/some (COVID responsible) events I've been to recently.  I figured it's almost a year out of season, people must be bored of it by now, there are no thrift shops where I am so I took a chance on eBay and nabbed it for €20, it's in the post on the way to me and I'm feeling quite chuffed with myself.	episode_done:True
text:What's your fashion miracle?	labels:I used to wear small diamond earrings every day, and would put them in my wallet when I went to the gym after work. I got to work the next day and realized I forgot to put them back in after the gym, so I opened up my wallet and they were gone. I had made my usual morning stop for breakfast on the way to work, so I rushed to the food cart and looked all over the sidewalk but I couldn’t find them.  At least 1-2 weeks later I went to the same food cart for breakfast, looked down, and saw one diamond earring in the crack in the sidewalk. I looked more closely and there was the other one! The metal was chewed up (they were bezel set) so I had to get them repaired, but it was a lot cheaper than a new pair!   Definitely my #1 fashion (jewelry?) miracle.
text:That's incredible! I'm a notorious earring-loser, so I never wear nice ones. This gave me so much satisfaction ❤	labels:It was insane that I found them! I still went to the same food cart pretty much every day after losing them, and I would half-heartedly look down, but I never thought I’d actually find them! This was in a big city by a bunch of office buildings, hospitals, etc., so a ton of foot traffic. I just assumed someone else found them and that was their lucky day, LOL.	episode_done:True
text:What's your fashion miracle?	labels:I had this perfect oversized navy and white striped linen tee from LOFT. I loved it for years and then it got a big ol hole and I don't know how to fix linen (can you fix linen idk?) so I had to let her go.   I was heartbroken, she was so good to me, always covering my pasty white skin while keeping me cool, hiding my belly on fatter days and tucking beautifully into some jeans on less fat days.  I wasn't even really aware of resale sites until last year because I hadn't really gotten into secondhand shopping yet. Then it took a while to realize that I can re-buy all my dearly departed favorites.  Then one day I searched for her on posh and we were reunited in less than a week. It was beautiful and I feel whole again.	episode_done:True
text:What's your fashion miracle?	labels:I think the biggest miracle was when my favorite summer top (a black tight crop top with lots of straps in the back) came back in stock. It was on sale (it was too expensive for me to get at full-price) and was sold out before I got my hands on it. I checked the site over and over if it was back. One lucky day, I was in the cafeteria with my friends and eating lunch, I decided to check it again. And it was back, only one piece, and in my size! You can guess how fast I clicked the order button.  My second best miracle was finding black Dr. Martens at TK Maxx for only 50€ (they sell for about 200€ usually). They've been my fall and winter staple ever since.	episode_done:True

text:I’m really confused by the economics of these. One time I counted how many different styles of “insert phrase here” shirts there were at Target, I think there were at least 10 or 12.

text:I Dyed My Jeans With $6 Dye and Here Are The Results	labels:Just going to put it out there, as a costumer who spends a lot of time dying fabric... RIT dyes   almost never take entirely, and tend to produce spotty results. You can use them in a \*very loose\* dyebath to produce a wash, but for anything else, you're taking the risk of producing a patchy result.     If a garment is truly precious to you, I would definitely recommend hitting up the internet (or a specialist's crafts/fabric store--not just the big chains) for Jacquard or Dharma dyes. They're more expensive, but we're talking about the difference between spending $10 to restore your favorite shirt or $6 to destroy it; I imagine for most folks it'll be worthwhile.	episode_done:True
text:I Dyed My Jeans With $6 Dye and Here Are The Results	labels:This is so great!

text:What are your fashion tips for looking good on Zoom?	labels:I’m late, but!  -	Sit next to or in front of a window -	download and use Snapcamera’s makeup for zoom filter if you’re not wearing makeup -	“adjust for low lighting” if you need to in zoom video settings -	go to a free stock image website like unsplash and look for “office” or “home office” or “living room” or “coffee shop” photos as your zoom background. It’s even better if your background lighting matches your real lighting  -	statement earrings also work out well for extra pizzaz. -	if you can help it, angle the camera slightly higher than your head, or whatever you use as your “selfie” angle. If you can’t do this then at the very least do not have the camera angled up at your face. -	I have noticed when I have my monitors blue light filter on, because the screen is more yellow toned, it warms up my skin on camera lol	episode_done:True

text:What are your fashion tips for looking good on Zoom?	labels:I think it's all in camera placement and lighting.  Have the camera at eye level or slightly above it. My laptop webcam was at a seriously unflattering angle, even when propped up. I just got a webcam that I put on my main monitor and the angle alone makes me look 10x better.   Get a light source behind your camera that's pointed at your face. Get a ring light if you can. Play around with desk lamps. If you have 2 lamps, try placing them behind the camera, one on each side of you. If you have 1, try placing it behind the camera pointed directly at you, try to bounce the light off the wall, etc. If you're sitting with your back to a window, close your blinds.  What color is your desk chair? Don't wear a shirt that's the same color. Other than that, I think anything goes with respect to fashion. You only really see like 10% of the person's top on videos.  Makeup wise, I like to wipe my face with an oil-blotting sheet to make sure I'm not shiny, lots of blush and bronzer, and  a YLBB shiny lip balm.	episode_done:True

text:How to look elegant without looking old?	labels:I feel like this question gets asked a lot, and I feel like it’s never about the clothes. I checked all three of these accounts, and the outfits weren’t anything you couldn’t put together at Zara.  However, these women seem to be very tall and thin with really nice hair and Birkin bags.

text:How to look elegant without looking old?	labels:I think it’s hard to ignore that these women are supermodel beautiful and have had procedure enhancements, brow procedures, professional make up, etc. Their outfits are cool but on an average woman I don’t think any of it would necessarily read “wealthy”.	episode_done:True
text:How to look elegant without looking old?	labels:Oy this will be jerked if it isn't yet...  I looked at the first account and you can actually see a pattern in her outfit: athleisure, black and white pairing, combat boots, leather jacket and structured handbag. It's good that you're looking for inspo, now you go through it with an analytical mind and try to find the pattern. Then you try to reproduce.   Like others have said, I don't find the style quite elegant or expensive. But if you're into it, it's totally possible to recreate!	episode_done:True
text:How to look elegant without looking old?	labels:It is a good thing you put the links of the instagrammers, because their looks was not what I imagined from the word "elegant".  They are thin and fit, likely with lots of cosmetic surgery and beauty treatments, one is very tall, they are all very "done". It is a look, and everybody do their own thing. Their look is very body conscious, very revealing, very showing off curves (in the right places since they are very thin.. Always explicitly sexy. It is indeed, maybe stereotypical very russian, or eastern european in general.  Some  observations about those looks and if you want to :  - keep shoes all pristine. High heels or sneakers or combat boots, but keep them as  pristine as possible.  - when in doubt, downsize clothes (this is against my regular advice, but this is a specific look).  - usually always showing one of legs/cleavage/midriff.  - very brand aware but you will find similar pieces everywhere starting from primark up...	episode_done:True
text:How to look elegant without looking old?	labels:What those instagrammers depict is that sort of standard put-together-basic-high-life luxury look.

text:How to look elegant without looking old?	labels:I might suggest checking out the book “A Guide to Elegance” by Genevieve Antoine Dariaux. It was written in a different time, but it has a lot of great advice when it comes to “elegance” and how to achieve it. It’s also quite funny!  For example: “To be elegant is first of all to know oneself, and to know oneself well requires a certain amount of reflection and intelligence. Consequently, a woman who is utterly stupid will always find it extremely difficult to become truly elegant.”

Also ignoring the fact these three probably have teams to help them look how they want ;)  First off is how you carry yourself - how you walk, how you pose for photos, how you sit and stand etc. It helps to have a friend, a good sized mirror, or to record yourself - then watch how people you see as being elegant move and hold themselves, then copy them and practice.  Second would be presentation. The instagrammers you mention have long, clean, shiny hair in simple styles. More neutral colours for makeup - but be aware it takes a lot of time and product (and practice!) to get their kinda looks. Clean, well manicured nails - they don't have to be too long but no chipped polish, dirt under nails etc. Clothes that fit (find a tailor if you can afford to alter clothes for you, or learn to do it yourself) . A cheap shirt that's been altered to fit you will look better than a more expensive one that fits badly.  And thirdly would be mindset - this also ties into the first because no matter how much practice you've had, if you feel clumsy and nervous you will find a lot harder to pull off looking elegant.	episode_done:True
text:How to look elegant without looking old?	labels:Good personal grooming-  neat hair, clean teeth/breath, “nails covered by at least clear nail polish” etc, Clothing- tailored, looks neat (no wrinkles, lint, excessive pilling, etc） Bags / shoes- I think these can really elevate an outfit, but remember even if your bag is $$$$ it still needs to be neat/ not too visibly worn out.  “Walking with confidence” is also important.   I think that Aly Art and Merriam style are good sources for finding your style.. Anna Bey’s channel I think is good for learning about modern elegance and at the very least self confidence, “living life to your fullest” and self respect even if you aren’t preparing to have formal dinners with a kind every evening or having an expensive lifestyle. I don’t know of other sources for “modern elegance”..   Knowing what lines and colors look good on you also makes a difference in your appearance.	episode_done:True
text:Jeans: Recommendations and Reviews	labels:Honestly I think you have to give way more detail on your old pair and what you’re looking for.  In my mind the biggest hurdle to perfect jeans is the fit, and since every body is different this is highly individual. Some people might prefer stretchier denim for a more forgiving fit, while others look for stiffer fabric, and have less leeway.   Personally I still struggle to find a high rise, non cropped, fits my thighs and waist, plain dark wash, straight/skinny, 90% or more cotton, pair of jeans. But hopefully I’ll find it eventually!

text:Levis premium 501 high rise skinny (99% cotton with the button fly) - the cut for this season is more straight than truly skinny despite the name. I picked up 3 pairs in the sales recently. Immediately trying them on they look a bit loose in the lower leg and a bit tight in the hip & thigh but after wearing for one day they've relaxed and conformed to my body and look perfect. I do advise sizing down - the size chart said 28 for me but I had to exchange for 25 (25" is my actual waist size if that helps).	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Jeans: Recommendations and Reviews	labels:If you like skinny jeans, American Eagle are my favorite “affordable” (for me) jeans. I am tall, slender, and not very curvy and their “next level super high-waisted jegging” is my favorite. If you can spend more, my holy grail skinny jeans are the Good American Good Waist jeans. They’re super flattering, they hold in my belly, and they don’t get baggy in the waist even after multiple wears. To extend the life of your jeans, try to wash them as little as possible and keep them out of the dryer! If your jeans have any kind of elastic in them, the heat of the dryer basically melts it over time so your jeans don’t look as good or last as long.	episode_done:True
text:Can someone tell me where people get their outfits that we see during Seoul Fashion Week?	labels:A lot of people who go to these things are SUPER into fashion and most likely have been collecting clothes for a long time. While some definitely wear more avant-garde or lesser known brands, a lot wear your usual luxury brands too. In the first picture is a JW Anderson cap bag which goes for about USD800-900 new. Third picture has a Lady Dior that runs about 4000-5000+ new. I'm not familiar with any of the clothing but some brands you could look into as a first step are Undercover and Comme des Garçons (and its various lines).  For the affordability issue, I second going on Yahoo! Japan and other resale sites but you need to know what you're looking for and have some idea of what might be a fake. This is also good if you're looking for past season clothing and other rare pieces. For more current stuff, you can also try SSENSE during their sale seasons.	episode_done:True

text:Hiking Aesthetic - Functionality vs. Fashion	labels:Honestly, most people that get serious about hiking learn pretty quickly that fashion is low on the priority list. You can colour coordinate your gear but it's not really going to be fashion.
text:Exactly this truthfully. You start to look at everything your wearing for its physical properties. Something that will keep me 1 degree warmer while not increasing my weight is way more important than any fashion considerations. I'm not even nearly as serious as most people.   Otherwise on casual day hikes I just wear a mix of "normal" clothes and what is most important to me such as shoes and socks.   Not to say you can't go the "other" way with your clothing. I wear my merino wool base layers under regular clothing all the time same with my hiking socks. I also have multiple copies of my hiking pants that I wear both hiking and as casual wear.  I think the only thing that really matters is don't wear cotton/linen/plant fibers hiking, unless your bringing a change of clothes.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Hiking Aesthetic - Functionality vs. Fashion	labels:I wear my yoga clothes with hiking boots and a Patagonia fleece in the summer and fall, Patagonia Radalie jacket in the winter. My friend has a UV protection shirt (REI house brand) which she wears due to the intense UV rays in Colorado. It doesn’t make her feel hot most days. I mostly thrift my yoga/hiking clothes, and really like thrifted Lululemon. Although I hike and do yoga frequently, I won’t buy Lululemon full price when there are so many used gear stores near me. I buy Zella leggings also for both activities. My hiking boots are currently Oboz, my trail running shoes are Asics, and I have heard good things about Salomon hiking boots. Fjallraven has very nice beanies for colder weather.  I definitely say fashion takes a backseat to function for hiking, as you primarily want to be comfortable, however, living in the mountain west, I want to look nice during an activity I do about once weekly, so fashion is at least a consideration for me.  (Edit) You can absolutely hike in your everyday clothing, and I have seen people hike 14,000 foot mountains in gym shorts and a T shirt. As long as your boots and socks are solid and the rest is easy to move in, you’re honestly good to go.
text:I love Salomon for Hiking boots, trail runners, ski boots, literally everything. I also love the Adv Skin 5 Hydration Pack :)   I've started wearing trail runners for day hikes and I like how much lighter they are as well as how quickly they dry (not having to take them off for stream crossings is huge). Granted I don't have any issues with ankle mobility and I consider myself to be pretty coordinated where I don't need hiking boots to help with stability if I'm not doing a longer trip.  The point about thrifted Lululemon is solid as well. I have leggings that have held up for 10 years now, and I recently bought a pair of yoga shorts from the brand and they're pilling like crazy, while the old ones I have look newer than the new pair.	labels:	episode_done:True

Crossover shoes like LL Bean boots, Kodiak, Teva (boots, shoes, sandals), and other brands work well on casual hikes and in the city. Knit sweaters and a rain jacket. Base layers so you can wear that cute top and blazer even when it's cold outside.  Does this help?	episode_done:True

text:Deceptive Marketing Practices by Fashion Companies	labels:I was a fabletics member for close to a year. I mostly liked their stuff but the quality was extremely variable. For the membership, they do give you an option to login to your account and either make a purchase of any amount or skip the month, otherwise you’d get charged $49.99 that you can use for store credit. I had a reminder set to skip and so most months I didn’t spend any money, but one month I forgot and got charged. I was so mad that I cancelled right away (which was easier than I worried it would be). In hindsight, I don’t like this set up and wouldn’t sign up for another rewards service that has a risk of being charged. I just want to buy (or not buy) things when I need them and not have it be dictated by needing to get something by a certain date. I don’t know of many brands offhand that have this kind of thing, so hopefully it’s not going to become the new norm.	episode_done:True

If you purchased any of Defendant Coach, Inc.’s (“Defendant” or “COACH”) outlet Merchandise[1] offered at a discount from a “MFSRP,” you may be eligible to receive a payment from a class action settlement (“Settlement”). The lawsuit against Defendant alleges that the “MFSRP” statements on the tags of the Merchandise offered at a discount from a “MFSRP” are misleading because they included the price of its retail goods, creating the false impression that its outlet store Merchandise was once sold in COACH’s full-line retail stores and was of the same quality and workmanship as merchandise sold in COACH’s full-line retail stores. Defendant denies any and all wrongdoing of any kind whatsoever and denies any liability to Plaintiffs and to the Settlement Class. The Court has not decided who is right. Both sides have agreed to settle the dispute and provide an opportunity for payments and other benefits to Settlement Class Members. The case is called Marino, et al v. Coach, Inc., Lead Case Number 1:16-cv-01122-VEC (OTW).   **I’m quite pleased. I always thought the Made-For-Outlet-Markdown-From-MSRP was super shady.**	episode_done:True

text:All things K-Fashion!	labels:I love k-fashion and tbh it’s the biggest inspiration for my style. I got into Korean things in elementary school so it’s been a long time. There is (or was) a huge kfashion community on tumblr which I’m a part of. I’ve collected a list of 100+ stores through the years but some of my favorite brands are the big ones like stylenanda and chuu. When I think of kfashion, especially in the past 5 years or so, I think of very minimalistic in terms of color pallets with interesting silhouettes. What you see in most kdramas isn’t necessarily what’s trending on the style blogs and online stores.	episode_done:True
text:All things K-Fashion!	labels:I lived in Korea for awhile (2008 and 2009) and it was, hands down, the best dressed country I have ever seen in my life (and I am a real live Italian). So much fun fashion. What I wouldn't do for an entire day in Myeongdong just unloading all my cash. Something I've noticed is that a lot of trends that were popular over a decade ago have stuck around in some iteration -- pastels never seem to get old there, even if they're used in different ways. Oversized clothes were a staple then as now. Unabashed logos. I still try to incorporate facets of Korean fashion into how I dress over a decade later.	episode_done:True
text:All things K-Fashion!	labels:I feel like a stumbling point ofr US people is that the streetstyle isn't always...lady shaped(?). Like in Korea they'll wear baggy tops with baggy pants and it all fits, but isn't fitted. Even the streetstyle guide author in her demos still retained the American silhouette.	episode_done:True
text:All things K-Fashion!	labels:I love watching kdramas for fashion!! Partly I get sad though because I know that stuff is sponsored/product placements and I could never afford them 😭   I do enjoy SK fast fashion too though, and had so much fun shopping in Hongdae, Dongdaemun amd Ewha back when travel was a thing. Ditto for Japan! The clothes there are just more fashion forward, well-made and affordable. Whereas a similar looking piece (same quality) would cost $80 or something at Aritzia.	episode_done:True

text:All things K-Fashion!	labels:It’s a very stylish show; I’ve only seen the first episode but it got me wondering exactly what size shirt I need to buy to get the effortlessly oversized look she’s wearing when she first crash-lands.

It was cold when I eloped so I wore velvet to keep me warm! This was pre covid but I’d wear the same thing today.  My backup would be a jumpsuit or dress from electric feathers.

It's been 11 years and I'm still sad about it. We always said we'd go back and have a do-over, but things happened and life continues to happen and I'll never get to run around Vegas in my wedding dress. I have worn it any chance I get though! Holiday parties or other random events. People are always weird about it "um. Is that a wedding dress?" Me: hell yeah ! I love my wedding dress. I'm gonna wear it as long as I can! I feel like a mother fucking princess in it!" Also, I'm happy I work hard to stay fit enough to still fit into it. Haha. I bought it on Craigslist for $400. I love it. I will continue to wear it as much as possible without any cares because I feel good in it.   That being said. Wear what you feel best in! If it's a wedding dress or sweat pants. YOLO it with all your confidence.	episode_done:True

text:Does anyone take their “power color” really seriously? Basing a whole wardrobe around one color - not just choosing an accent color for a neutral capsule?	labels:It sounds very eye catching and unique tbh. I’d say go for it.

text:Does anyone have a "uniform"?	labels:I often buy multiples of items I love. I bought several of the same cardigan after I realized that I wore it more than any other sweater I owned.

If I love something but I'm either not able to afford it or just not ready to pull the trigger, I take a photo of myself in the item, a photo of the store tag, and a photo of the tags on the clothing (especially any tag with a style number). I spent 3 years looking for a specific out of my budget Paige denim jacket that I tried on at Nordstrom Rack by scouring ebay, etsy, poshmark, etc.   Last month I finally found the exact jacket (confirmed by the style number and tag information) on Poshmark in excellent shape for a great price. Unfortunately in those 3 years I've gained a bit more weight than I realized and it's a bit tighter than my original try on photos, but still wearable!
text:Oh hell yes. Happy for you!  It’s a good idea to take pics of tags, I haven’t thought of that. That would make second-hand searches so much easier.  Y’all convinced me. I’ll start searching for another one of a dress that a snap is broken on 🤞	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone have a "uniform"?	labels:No, I really couldn’t fathom it to be honest. I like too many colors, I like too many patterns and florals. Not everything I like goes with the other things I like. I know it’s simpler for some people but I don’t see the fun in it.

text:Does anyone have a "uniform"?	labels:It makes life easier although now I just fuss over which top to wear. I typically wear jeans/black pants, printed top, coordinating cardigan, flats and earrings. Sometimes I change out the pants for a skirt or dress, and the cardigan for a sweater. I gave up aspirational dressing a long time ago and started dressing for the activities in my life. I'm much happier and my clothes get worn!	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone have a "uniform"?	labels:I wouldn’t call it a uniform per se, but I think I’m a very “formulaic” dresser when it comes to everyday workwear and casual wear.   For a work day, it’s always black loafers + black pants + simple top, whether it be a sweater or blouse. I work in a very conservative industry but my office is usually pretty casual, so I find this formula is best for most days and I can throw on a blazer or heels I keep in my office if needed. I would hate to be in a situation where I have to run to a meeting short notice, which happens more often than I’d like to admit, and look like a sore thumb in terms of casualness compared to the other women in the room, who are usually a lot older and more advanced in their careers than I am. I pretty much only wear the same jewelry everyday for work too.   For going out and weekends, it’s usually fun shoes + jeans + nice top + a fun element, either a statement bracelet or statement earrings.   I think my style can get a bit predictable in that I own the same pair of black pants 4 times and 3 pairs of very similar loafers, but I have fun items like cheetah ankle boots I’m obsessed with to make it fun, but can also get away with for work. I echo previous comments about fussing over tops though with this formula, and the idiocy of men copying Zuckerberg or Jobs with the uniforms... don’t they realize that they don’t/didn’t look particularly good??	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone have a "uniform"?	labels:This sub celebrates all sorts of fashion but not everyone is up for endless variety. If this is something you’re keen about, you should go for it. But slowly - make sure that the multiple versions of one outfit is something you really love wearing and won’t get bored of before you buy more  If this is more like an area you are exploring due to frustration of having nothing to wear, consider a capsule wardrobe instead. It’s much more involved and intentional than coming up with a uniform but it is a little more flexible	episode_done:True

text:How has your style changed as you’ve gotten older?	labels:I was gothpunk with shades of scenekid and vintage-sexy supreme.  I am now living my best life as future-cult bossbish and reincorporating punk elements in to my wardrobe because it is fly as hell and representative of my true self.  I think the trajectory for counter culture folk is almost always: counter culture -> normal core -> reincorporate elements once more secure in life because its not aphasemom.	episode_done:True
text:How has your style changed as you’ve gotten older?	labels:While my style has evolved over the years, the number one concrete example I can think of is... pushup bras. During college I basically exclusively wore heavily padded push-up bras that I thought helped me look proportional. Now I’m much more comfortable with my body and don’t feel the need to squish my boobs into oblivion anymore.	episode_done:True
text:How has your style changed as you’ve gotten older?	labels:In college I still shopped the juniors section and never imagined outgrowing it, taste wise. Here to tell you that I want next to nothing in the juniors department and wear mostly basics to work (which I individualize with jewelers, accessories, or footwear)	episode_done:True
text:How has your style changed as you’ve gotten older?	labels:In high school I wanted to be as punk rock as I could be. I spiked my hair up, DIY-ed everything, and bought my first pair of Doc Martens at 14. I either worked at Hot Topic or a body piercing studio through school. I grew up in an affluent/conservative area so my goal was to be as weird to everyone as possible. Music was my main influence.  In college my style changed a lot since I went to school for fashion. I moved to LA where I didn't feel like I had to rebel against anyone anymore. I started incorporating other musical influences like goth, new wave, and grunge into my style. I started appreciating higher quality designer clothing but had zero money. While I really wanted to shop at places like Saint Laurent, Alexander McQueen, and AllSaints, I ended up just wearing all black all the time and trying to get those looks for less.  Now I'm in my mid 20s, moved out of California, started my career, and finally have some expendable income. I'm really influenced by 60s/70s rock n roll. I try and buy all high quality pieces that I'm obsessed with so I don't feel like I'm always having to shop.  I do still have and wear my original Doc Martens though	episode_done:True
text:How has your style changed as you’ve gotten older?	labels:Gosh when I was a teen my style was all over the place. A little bit preppy mixed with animal print and glam/bling, etc. I was a lot more adventurous with color and styles, but now being 29 and a mom, I prefer all dark colors (a lot of black), and have a more refined but edgy style. Think the kooples and all saints. Dark tops, fitted bottoms, clubmaster style sunglasses, structured coats. I won’t ever give up my black vans eras, or Adidas r1s though.	episode_done:True
text:How has your style changed as you’ve gotten older?	labels:In my earlier 20s I dressed Sustainably, or at least LOOKED like I did. Big, oversized linen shirts with roomy pants. I only bought basics, and neutrals, but the clothes themselves were pretty boring and uninspired.   Then I went back to black, wore some Phillip Lim black trousers everywhere and a fitted top. Still very basic and safe, but I knew about designers and trends. I had more money to spend on clothing, but not enough for the clothes I really wanted (thank god i didnt have the cash to drop on some jesse kamm sailor pants...-_-)  This past year I've come more into my own, and I feel way more comfortable with myself. So now I'm finally developing my own style (which ive honestly been doing for decades...) and buying pieces that aren't so basic. Colorwise....it's a lot of black. But it's mixed with fun accessories, anime keychains on my bag, and innovative fabrics (eg Pleats Please) My reservations around feeling uncomfortable in my clothing, or sticking out too much, has really dwindled. I'm leaning into avant-garde designers while still incorporating my leftovers from my Sustainable phase.	episode_done:True
text:How has your style changed as you’ve gotten older?	labels:I've always been chubby growing up, and because of my insecurities I use to cover myself up from head to toe. Hair down, baggy shirt with long sleeves showing no chest, tall jeans with no holes, knee socks below the jeans, and a pair of old sneakers. I use to wear black a lot as well because it was slimming. I never owned dresses, shorts, tank tops, or sandals because I believed they were to revealing.  Nowadays, I am a lot more confident in my appearance. I partially contribute that to my weight loss, but my friends now also helped in boosting my confidence. I'm now able to wear jeans with holes in them, I still don't like sleeveless shirts, but am able to wear more fitted clothing and show some skin. I no longer wear knee high socks and sometimes just go out in sandals or some heels. I love playing with colors now and feel as if I'm on the path to finding a style which truly suits me. I also recently bought my first pair of shorts since I was a child, so that's exciting 😗	episode_done:True
text:How has your style changed as you’ve gotten older?	labels:I’ve gotten a lot more conservative and preppy. In my teens and 20s, I was basically a high end version of ABG - Asian baby girl. I put away the manolos and louboutins for Cole Haan flats and splurge on Hermes scarves.	episode_done:True
text:How has your style changed as you’ve gotten older?	labels:Former goth/emo kid as well. Emo kid in high school, then clubwear/raver in college, with periods of normal and/or prep mixed in.   My aesthetic now is lagenlook/witchy/cozy. Nowadays I pay a lot more attention to quality and fabrics/materials. Having more disposable income I’d rather spend money on quality fabrics such as linen, genuine leather and sterling silver rather than polyester and fake leather etc. Comfort is also a much bigger factor as any uncomfortable garments never get worn. I haven’t worn heels in years. I stopped styling my hair and instead switched to hats. Makeup has slowly phased out except for special occasions. Color palette now leans towards earthy tones when they used to be loud and/or all black. I’ve been working from home full time for years, so basically my wardrobe has shifted from ‘meant to be seen’ to ‘cute but also suitable for going about my day without anything riding up/pinching/etc.”   I also shop with a lot more intention now too. Before I would just pick out tons of whatever I thought was cheap and cute. Now everything I bring into my wardrobe undergoes a LOT of scrutiny before I buy it, even if it’s cheap.	episode_done:True
text:How has your style changed as you’ve gotten older?	labels:In my teens, my style was a bit all over the place, but I mostly wore darker colors and did the whole emo/scene kid thing. I hated anything overly feminine, flowy dresses/skirts, florals, earth tones and light colors, anything boho.   15 years later, I now wear a fuck ton of the boho clothes I used to hate lol	episode_done:True
text:Do you feel constrained fashion-wise by not wanting to (or being able to) wear heels?	labels:Personally, I don't feel constrained because I feel like heels have kind of fallen out of style. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying they're unstylish -- I just feel like nobody wears them and so I'm not drawn to buy any. I personally prefer sneakers on any outfit. And even if it's a fancy outfit I'll wear flats.	episode_done:True
text:Do you feel constrained fashion-wise by not wanting to (or being able to) wear heels?	labels:I can only wear new balance ugly sneakers with custom orthotics or boots. Boots like hiking or cowboy, I bought my first pair of ankle cowboy boots a year ago. I wear them with everything have my eye on some black lizard ankle length from Tecovas for my next pair.   Wearing heels one night distroys my feet for weeks. It’s not worth the pain.  I started out specifically buying clothing that would look good with cowboy boots (skinny jeans). Now I rock them with any and everything. Just tucked them into a pair of blue plaid trousers and they looked awesome.   Its surprising how much more confident you feel when your feet aren’t miserable. Also my boots were $200 bucks why should I be concerned about them not being “fancy of fashionable.”	episode_done:True
text:Do you feel constrained fashion-wise by not wanting to (or being able to) wear heels?	labels:I don't feel constrained at all. I've never really worn heels and I finally threw the few I had out last year. I get compliments on my shoes and outfits often.
text:The most important part when tailoring an outfit around flats is, well, tailoring! Make sure to get a pant that fits well at the waist to elongate the leg line, then have the legs hemmed to fit your height.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Do you feel constrained fashion-wise by not wanting to (or being able to) wear heels?	labels:Interesting!  I...actually wear heels in my casual life all the time lol, including when I run errands.  But never stilettos!  I'm in my 30s and wear a lot of block heels and kitten heels.  It makes me feel better/more powerful, and evens out my proportions in a way I appreciate.  Maybe that's why they're so common in influencer photos?  That said, I think certain flats can look really sharp if the rest of the outfit is tailored well.  In my mind, flats make good tailoring even more important as you aren't adjusting your proportions with your shoes.  When I wear flats, I'm hyper-vigilant about the proportions of the rest of my outfit.	episode_done:True
text:Do you feel constrained fashion-wise by not wanting to (or being able to) wear heels?	labels:I don't feel constrained at all. I've never really worn heels and I finally threw the few I had out last year. I get compliments on my shoes and outfits often.

text:Do you feel constrained fashion-wise by not wanting to (or being able to) wear heels?	labels:I recently lived in Paris near some of the the biggest tourist attractions, and I would spot Instagram influencers daily. I’d say I’d see them change into heels about half the time. Some folks just commit, but it always stood out as unusual. Paris is not stiletto friendly. Although it’s seen as a formal city, compared to any American metropolis, footwear is casual and out wear is practical. That being said, a 2-3 inch heeled boot or bootie was not uncommon and along with sneakers, the norm.   My most memorable influencer sighting was a very glamorous woman in a tiny yellow dress and heels on a 40 degree (Fahrenheit) day taking pictures on a windy terrace, only to see her minutes later coming out of a public restroom in weather appropriate and casual attire.   I feel like this stuff is dependent on your own lifestyle, and the context of the city. My own comfort level with heels has changed significantly over the past decade, from wearing a heel everywhere, everyday to now owning one pair for parties.  As for non-heeled influencers: there are so many! What kind of style do you gravitative towards?
text:Lol cute story. Once when my disability was really bad I was the first passenger to board a flight, and while the staff was helping me, I saw a stylish young woman plop down in first class and do a few selfies before going to her actual seat in economy!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Do you feel constrained fashion-wise by not wanting to (or being able to) wear heels?	labels:> This would not be such a problem except the outfits they are posting oftentimes do not look good without heels, especially for people that are short like themselves! Midi skirts that hit at an awkward spot, long billowy trousers, etc.  This may sound like blasphemy, but I'm a genuine shortarse and I wear *both flats and heels* with those things. And usually lower, blockier heels because I don't want to break my face on the pavement.   If I could take a decent selfie I would be all about that fashion blogger in flats life. Alas.	episode_done:True
text:Do you feel constrained fashion-wise by not wanting to (or being able to) wear heels?	labels:Suffering for the sake of beauty went out with Scarlett O’Hara.   Every time I think “my calves would look great if I wore heels” I remind myself how much my feet would hate me and how great my calves already look.   I can do a 1” heeled bootie but I walk too much to find a higher heel appealing.	episode_done:True
text:Do you feel constrained fashion-wise by not wanting to (or being able to) wear heels?	labels:I feel my best in heels. I completely identify with that actress who insisted her character would keep her heels on in Jurassic World. I hate how casual everything has gotten and can’t wait for sneakers with everything to die the ignominious death they deserve.   That being said, 3 inch stilettos are not a shoe to wear frequently. I pretty much live in flats or stacked heel boots. I would love to see more practical heels have a moment once the clunky shoe trend runs its course.	episode_done:True
text:Do you feel constrained fashion-wise by not wanting to (or being able to) wear heels?	labels:Yes! I’ve never worn heels regularly but am genetically pre-disposed to foot problems and have had multiple foot surgeries. I’ve been trying to commit to flats or low heels (under an inch) only. It’s so hard when your legs aren’t stick thin and the standard in formal and professional womenswear is always a freaking heel. I’m starting to accept that certain pants/dresses/skirts won’t work on me without a heel. So I spend less money on variety and heeled shoes but more time looking for stylish flat shoes and clothing that works with them. Unfortunately I don’t have any blogs to share. Just wanted to commiserate and say that it’s ok to avoid heels completely for medical reasons - the mythical comfortable heeled shoe doesn’t exist for some of us!	episode_done:True

text:I bought a gorgeous teal wedding kaftan with matching floor length vest and beaded waist belt in Morocco. It was really unique from all the others as it was much more understated and all the beadwork was also done with teal beads (different from most which have a lot of gold accents). I was particularly proud because I bargained down to 450 dirhams or around $45 for it.   Wore it once in Jardin Majorelle but without the floor length waist coat but was so excited to wear that piece with western clothes. Was even considering wearing it at my wedding.  Well, we make it back to a hostel in Madrid and since I can’t sleep, I take a little thc tincture to help put me to sleep. Well, I wake up high, 5 min before checkout and obviously, since my bag is quite full with gifts and Moroccan goodies now, my clothes are having a hard time fitting, so naturally, I put MY FAVORITE REFORMATION OUTFIT AND NEW MOROCCAN GOWN IN A PLASTIC BAG AND TIE IT TO THE OUTSIDE OF MY BACKPACK.   As we’re walking through the train to go to Seville, I realize that, SURPRISE!, bag is no longer attached and I lost it somewhere on the walk.   Obviously we called the hostel but it wasn’t there...3 hour train ride with my fiancé was SILENT. I don’t think I’ve ever been more angry and everytime I looked at that backpack for days it would make so angry.   Teal Kaftan, please know how sorry I am and how much I miss you.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Books on Fashion	labels:A little esoteric, but *Subculture: The Meaning of Style* by Dick Hebdige is an amazing piece of writing on how clothing and style is a form of resistance. You might be able to find a PDF of it online, it's fairly short but definitely worth looking at.   Nora Waugh's *The Cut of Women's Clothes* is more of a historical costume reference book, but the first hand accounts from women's letters and journals about clothing is so universal it makes my heart sing. Also an excellent survey of how the fashion industry and construction methods changed over time.   *Women's Work: The First 20,000 Years* by Barber. While not fashion specifically, it is a *incredible* deep dive into how clothing was first "invented" and how integral women were and are to the creation of thread, fabric, and clothes. It is remarkably well written and a part of history that was completely new to me. I was unable to put it down, so good.   *Fashion-ology: An Introduction to Fashion Studies* by Yuniya Kawamura is heady, but worth it. It's a sociological look at how fashion works as a mindset, industry, and construct. It hits a lot of the themes that pop up in this sub, including the moral and technological debates that occupy a lot of 21st C thought.	episode_done:True

text:Those of you who, like me, don't have a closet (sob).. how do you organize your clothing/shoes/accessories/jewelry?	labels:I’m in a railroad apt built in the early 1900s; lots of walls and no closets.   The Ikea closet systems are kind of amazing.  I have the tension rod system (floor to ceiling) with a large deep dresser, clothing rod, and cubbies at the top. I had an old over the door hook rail that I put on the clothes bar so I can hang worn-but-still-clean-clothes on hooks. Clean ones are on hangers. My sister got the PAX system for her place and is really happy with it.    I also have a normal dresser that I put anything foldable in to, including intimates. It’s also my “night stand”.   Shoes - i keep a few high use ones by the door. I have a shoe rack elsewhere. My entryway is nonexistant, otherwise I’d prefer to have the shoe rack near the door too. Got a slim one from Yamazaki. Occasion shoes and seasonal (snow boots for example) stay boxed and under or ontop of my Ikea closet until they’re needed. Then they go in the daily area.   Out of season clothes are in bins under my bed.   Jewelry and accessories - long stuff like necklaces, high use scarves, and long earrings are just hanging on a 5 tier pants hanger. The kind where you can release each bar? I had it laying around and it was cheap.  Smaller earrings and rings are in a jewelry box.   I have a peg rack for coats.

text:Those of you who, like me, don't have a closet (sob).. how do you organize your clothing/shoes/accessories/jewelry?	labels:I do have a closet, but I don't keep everything in it because I prefer to be able to see my clothes, so it mainly holds outerwear, dresses, skirts, and off season clothing.  My denim/stiffer fabric pants do get their own tiny set of drawers since I don't have a ton, but the rest of my clothes get organized in open shelving (IKEA Kallax.)  Shoes are in a shoe rack that I keep behind my closet door.  I have a ton of jewelry, so I have one of those over the door jewelry organizers, a bracelet holder, and I made myself a necklace holder out of wood, paint, and command hooks, since it was significantly cheaper than the one I liked.	episode_done:True

I was scrolling through Pinterest and looking at vintagey fashion rules, where they would actually tell fatter women “HEY don’t wear this - you will look like a refrigerator”.  I am all about wearing whatever you want and defying every “rule”. But it’s kind of fucking annoying when I want to dress to look my best and most flattered and every resource out there is saying “YOU GO GIRL you can rock ANYTHING YEAH”. It’s almost an EXCUSE to not have to do any research or have any design knowledge.  Honestly the whole “wear whatever you want” kind of ignores fatter women - like, oh I realize literally everything that’s “in” right now is not flattering on you because it’s made for a straight thin body - but IDC - fend for yourself. But I will hide this thought process behind “THERE ARE NO RULES - you’re beautiful and can wear ANYTHING”.   Tell it like it is. God I wish someone had told me to never wear mom/boyfriend jeans.	episode_done:True

text:I'm a little wary of using the terms "real" and "normal" to refer to women's bodies. All bodies are normal and real, they just range in size. No one size is more "real" than another. I mean if your point is showcasing actual untouched photos vs. photoshopped images I get it though.	labels:That’s a fair point and of course all human models are real people :). I didn’t mean to imply otherwise.  I picked ‘normal’ to differentiate from all the instagram models and fashion models I follow on Instagram. Not that they’re abnormal, but they do have body measurements that are out of the norm statistically. I once read some data that said typical model measurements can only be found in <0.1% of the population.  Secondly, as you mentioned, there’s the other factor of airbrushing, perfect/professional posing, light etc. that is also special to typical Instagram models.

text:What are a few items that you feel are essential when planning a wardrobe?	labels:This absolutely depends on occasion. Where are you going to wear the stuff you want to curate? School/ uni? Office job? Partying? Hiking? I suggest you figure out your colors, needed occasions and a rough direction of style and look for capsule + whatever tags suit you.   If you have an idea of favourite pieces that look well on your frame you can try to look up those and build different outfits around them.  Just take it slow, and when adding new pieces make a rule that it has to go with a certain amount of pieces you already own or plan to get soon.   Last advice, depending on your funds (or people who want to give you a present) do a professional color and style consulting; your body type won‘t change too soon, your colors never will, so this is a great investment.	episode_done:True
text:What are a few items that you feel are essential when planning a wardrobe?	labels:It's important to be mindful of buying things that you'll actually wear and not things that you think you should wear or that are just aspirational for you. If it doesn't fit your lifestyle or it's uncomfortable, you're not going to reach for it and it's just going to sit in your closet collecting dust. That doesn't mean you shouldn't buy things that push you out of your comfort zone, just approach it from a practical perspective.  Another guideline is to think about what need a piece fulfills and how it fits with your current wardrobe. If you find an awesome top but it only goes with one particular pair of pants then you're not going to get much use out of it. Or you own boots that work really well with black outfits but not brown-toned outfits, seek out an option that fits where your other boots fall short.   Your style is an ever evolving process, don't feel pressure to throw out everything you own and buy an all new wardrobe in whatever image you're trying to attain. Shop slow, be choosy, and observe others to analyze what you like and why you like it.	episode_done:True
text:What are a few items that you feel are essential when planning a wardrobe?	labels:IT depends on you.  What is your lifestyle (be realistic)?  When determining this, keep your area's climate in mind as well as your workplace (or school) dress code.  Also know your hobbies because a hiker is going to need vastly different attire than someone who likes clubbing.  IF your work environment is casual, then you don't need a closet full of business formal clothing.  If your workplace requires a uniform, then you don't need a wardrobe full of work clothes (unless the uniform is a dress code like black pants/white shirt).    If you're living in Miami, then you likely don't need a down parka.    That said, no matter your lifestyle, I'd have one outfit in your closet (could be the same thing or separates) to wear to a job interview, wedding (guest, not wedding party), and funeral.  Be prepared ahead of time should those occasions arise.    My other recommendation to learn color theory and the color seasons.   If you are unsure, try and find a celebrity that has similar coloring to you and study their wardrobe and what colors they wear on red carpets.  Know what colors look good on you and which ones do not.   I'm a clear winter, so my colors are jewel tones, icy pastels, and crisp colors.  Muted tones like olive, khaki, mustard, off white, etc look terrible on me.	episode_done:True
text:What are a few items that you feel are essential when planning a wardrobe?	labels:Completely depends on your lifestyle. My most essential item for work is a pair of shoes that are comfortable, easy to walk in, and stylish- I go for mules currently, but in years past, I was very into ballerina flats or pointy-toed plats and even had a stint with loving Tieks.   A pair of black skinny jeans has been a staple in my wardrobe for almost a decade now, so those are probably an essential for me also- although I've been getting more into straight and wide leg denim now.	episode_done:True
text:What are a few items that you feel are essential when planning a wardrobe?	labels:The first thing to do is to figure how your spend your time and what you like to wear for those occasions.    So hypothetically you spend 4 days a week in a business casual office. Workout 3 days a week. Go on a hike each weekend. And go clubbing 1x a week. And bar hopping 3x a week.   Then think about some outfits you like or style aspirations for each occasion. Then you can start to see what pieces might work and where you have some overlap.	episode_done:True
text:What are a few items that you feel are essential when planning a wardrobe?	labels:It all depends on your life and climate. I think a good waterproof coat is essential and weather proof boots, but if you like in a very very dry climate where it hardly rains, then obviously it is not. For some people snow boots and really heavy feather filled winter coats are essential, I got a coat and boots I only wear when travelling in winter to cooler places and they would be inadequate for a lot of places! I love jeans, some women hate the feeling and would rather do without.  I dunno. You got to you do you, think hard of what you find comfortable physically and mentally, what makes you think "pretty" or colors that cheer you up. How much do you walk? Shoe comfort and weather adequacy really matters.	episode_done:True
text:What are a few items that you feel are essential when planning a wardrobe?	labels:For me it's a tight undershirt (in lieu of a bra)-I like to have at least one regular and one that comes just under my bum (usually use this one in winter to keep cold out between my layers.   Also great to have a nice wrap coat/cardigan that is good for spring, summer, fall (can be worn closed or open). A good winter coat, better to invest more in something stylish and long lasting than to have several that are not great quality.  Wool skirt (any style) for winter time as well as wool or fleecy under layer of pants (with this one pair I can style many different ways and also wear under wool skirts with high socks for extra warmth in winter.	episode_done:True

text:Women that work labor jobs, what parts of your wardrobe are most important to you?	labels:Have also worked much of my life in jobs where I had to be ready to unload dirty stuff from a van and meet with clients on the same day, and currently (during non-covid days) in warehouse 2x/week though I don't have the shoe requirement.  You know the culture of the place best, I've found that in warehouse most people respect the manager more when they are dressed appropriately for the warehouse work, vs. when they dress mostly to "look like a manager".  But I also think there is something wanting to look more professional than just a shlubby t shirt, or at least having the option especially at first.  Knit polos with belted chinos or workpants look great and slightly professional while built for action.  Ponte work pants with an elastic waist are another option for days when you need to look dressier (such as a meeting), though I wouldn't get anything too fancy.  Durable button downs are another go-to.  They work well for layering - you can short sleeve or long sleeve, and wear them alone or over a camisole, shell, or t shirt.  Casual styles and fabrics like denim, flannel, twill, etc. work best.  Tops made of knit t-shirt fabric but with slightly dressier details or cuts are good.  One of my favorites of these I've had is a Lands End dark print long sleeve tee with a boatneck.  Looks dressier than a t shirt, and the dark print hides the occasional smudge.  This is also a way to achieve a more feminine style if that is an option you want.  Lands End, LL Bean, Carhartt, Duluth Trading Co. (sizes run large), Patagonia (including used, $$ but the stuff is indestructible), Eddie Bauer is the type of stuff I'd look at.	episode_done:True

text:Women that work labor jobs, what parts of your wardrobe are most important to you?	labels:I manage a farmers market and can wind up doing tons of different things throughout the day. I normally wear sneakers but I always have a pair of timberland hiking boots with me incase I need to go in the fields. I usually wear two different outfit styles- black skinny jeans with black Nike airmax, loose graphic/solid tee, with an open flannel or oversized denim jacket. Other style is dirty-white converse, loose vintage mom jeans, tight solid colored top and either no jacket or a cropped hoodie. I keep my nails neat and painted and wear a thin gold necklace and diamond studs, so this helps me look a little nicer. Obviously my styles don't have to be as formal as yours but I'm also a manager so I usually look more put together than my coworkers who often wear leggings/athletic clothes.	episode_done:True
text:Women that work labor jobs, what parts of your wardrobe are most important to you?	labels:/r/BlueCollarWomen might be of help here.  I split my time between the office (well, from home) and field work. For boots, I LOVE my Carhartt 6" composite toe hiking boots. I tried construction sole boots for a hot second and decided I have better traction with hiking boots. Red Wings has several women's safety toe shoes as well  For pants (again of the more cargo/field variety), I love 5.11 Tactical. They have women's cargo pants that are durable, actually cut for those of us with an ass, have useable pockets, and have a *hammer loop*. I bought one pair, tested it out for a month, loved them, and went back for 2 more.  As for looking professional, polo shirts are the default, but not particularly fashionable. Tailored fit button down camping shirts might be worth looking into as well. I'm not much help here because any time I'm meeting non-company personnel on site, I'm probably wearing company branded outerwear.
text:I am between an office and field also and I find good comfy boots, and comfortable base layers such as cami, t, and “long underwear” in the winter.  It makes a difference, I wear a uniform so it is pretty “lite” on make up and jewellery, but I work on a simple but nice job on my hair as it is also quite long and needs to be tied up high!.    If I need to be at a more professional or less “uniform” I will bring if I have to travel that day or while on course, I will take a few button ups , a nice blouse, and dress pants or skirt and tights.  As it is a toned down environment, it means classic but cute, so a nice set of earrings, classy but simple make up and a few muted accessories., a really cute classic skirt is easy to travel and pair it with a variety of shoes will work nicely.  It is a bit of a hassle bringing more clothes as well as shoes but it is often business casual.    I try and go a tad more than chinos and a polo if possible as I do not dress up often and it is a fun mix up.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Women that work labor jobs, what parts of your wardrobe are most important to you?	labels:For boots, I found Keen's women's work boots to be the most comfortable. I especially liked the Seattle line with an aluminum toe for my job but they have a ton of different styles with varying levels of safety ratings.   I've worked ina variety of mining and industrial settings and jeans were the norm for a normal work day, but that'll probably depend on your specific workplace. Many women wore skinny jeans or bootcut jeans.   I often just paired my jeans and boots with a sweater or closer cut blouse and cardigan. Occasionally I'd wear the polo my company gave me with a north face zip up.
text:Forgot to mention. I'd invest in a couple of pairs of nice wool socks if you're going to be wearing boots or heavy shoes for 12 hours. They can be a little expensive but so worth it for comfort and durability. I recommend the Darn Tough brand, especially because you can exchange them for a new pair if they ever have any problems, but any brand that you see in bass pro or rei will probably be nice. I recall that farm to feet is a little cheaper and still great.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Women that work labor jobs, what parts of your wardrobe are most important to you?	labels:If you don't have any requirements about synthetic fabrics, you have a lot more options. Are you in a climate controlled warehouse? I basically dress for outside weather every day just in case I get stuck out there all day.  Golf polos and dark jeans. T-shirts and tops with fancy/formal detailing (like a half zip and a little pocket, or a fabric with a neat pattern or modest see-through or lacey details on the shoulders). If they have giveaway or purchasable polos with the company logo those are a good option. I used to only wear unisex cotton blend tshirts to work on the days when I would be sweating a lot, but I invested in some nicer athletic fabric v neck tees from Under Armour and now even drenched in sweat I at least look better than I did in high school marching band camp. Also on the topic of sweating, if you know you'll get gross, bring a change of clothes so you can look and feel fresh for your afternoon meetings!  I've seen some womens' only safety toe brands, but never tried them. I use the free boot truck at work. But they have some that we call the "el jefe" boots, that look more like boating shoes or desert boots or are a nicer looking leather. Those might be a good option to make you feel confident and put together.  I think fit goes a long way to make you look professional (and like a boss).

So I took in the side seams and added darts and got it to fit perfectly, then wore it all the time, and it was probably more the confidence than the coat but my hopes about getting what I wanted with him were more than realized.

text:Closet Organization By Color	labels:I do style of clothing and then color within that  So short sleeve/tank blouses by color, then long sleeve by color, then dresses by color and so on.   Definitely helps me find the item I am looking for and identify where there might be gaps in my wardrobe
text:This is my system! I go from lightest to darkest color within each clothing category. I love the way my closet looks—meanwhile my husband’s half of the closet is 90% blue 😂	labels:Dark blue is a neutral and you can’t convince me otherwise!	episode_done:True
text:Closet Organization By Color	labels:I have a color coordinated closet in that all my shit is in palettes. It makes picking clothes a lot easier.  My workwear palette is Navy, Black, Light Pink, Ivory and Grey  My spring/summer casual palette is Sage, Ginger, Tan, Cream, White and Black  My fall/winter casual palette is Navy, Red, Brown and Grey  I always have my workwear out (with some adjustment for weather) but my winter and summer casual clothes go in storage when not in season	episode_done:True
text:Closet Organization By Color	labels:I have my clothing organized not only by color but by similar hues and tones. Like I don't just throw all my pinks together. Light muted pinks go with light muted pinks, baby pinks go with baby pinks, and so on.	episode_done:True
text:Closet Organization By Color	labels:I used to work at a clothing store, so no. Type first, then colour.	episode_done:True
text:Closet Organization By Color	labels:I 100% organize by color. It’s a little harder to pick outfits but very soothing.   Most of my capsule/daily closet is tops and I have like 50 of them so I pick that first - color and style of top or dress - and then I match pants that work.
text:I worked on it over the last few days and it’s so aesthetically pleasing! I love being able to go and pick out an outfit based on whatever color I’m feeling at the moment.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Closet Organization By Color	labels:I organize by type and sleeve length than color. So sweaters, long sleeve knit, long sleep top, short sleeve, tank and than withing this categories I do color. I find it easiest to navigate depending on the weather. I also use smart closet so I can see all my items as well without going through and pulling things out
text:I do this too without the color part, not for practical reasons but because I used to work at Marshalls and any other system would seriously bother me at this point, haha.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Closet Organization By Color	labels:Personally, I do this, but only within seasonal categories. As for dresses and jumpsuits, they're divided into cotton / linen and wool, but tops only are divided in "autumn / winter", "spring" and "summer" (I've had it "two" seasons before and didn't work). Longsleeves are "spring" while short sleeves are "summer", then there's the chambrays and flannels which are "autumn" and knits are somewhere else altogether.	episode_done:True
text:Closet Organization By Color	labels:My system includes by color, but it's a little complicated:  Left door: Dress/formal clothes   Right door: Casual clothes    I then categorize clothes by warmth, which is usually just sleeve length. No sleeves are in the center of the closet, then short sleeves, then long sleeves. Coats and jackets are at the edges.    Then each warmth section is organized by color: Black, grey, white, black/grey/white mix, cream/tan, brown, yellow, orange, red, pink, purple, blue, green.    It helps me readily identify where I have gaps in my wardrobe, whether I am ready for the upcoming seasons, and makes picking clothes super easy for the day's weather.	episode_done:True
text:Closet Organization By Color	labels:I organize in order of my thought process of what o want to wear. Typically I think about the type of clothing, the color I want, and then the sleeve length, dress length, or pant length. So each category of clothing is separated (tops, jackets, dresses, skirts, pants) then each category is organized by color. Within each color I order from shortest to longest (sleeve length, dress length, etc). Within each length I go lightest to darkest.   This method works well for my style of thinking, and I LOVE how it looks so organized and visually pleasing. I would really try to track your thought process when picking out an item/outfit and organize from there!	episode_done:True

text:What are your thoughts on outfit repeating multiple days in a row?	labels:I think the pressure is to not be "strange/unaware of your appearance" or more likely not to look "poor/can't afford more clothes." Some people do notice, and the rude ones point it out. This perception starts young. Growing up, there were teachers and other school staff who repeated outfits and other children loudly pointed it out.  I repeat outfits as much as possible if I'm not seeing the same people (my household doesn't count). The internal pressure is strong to not repeat within a few weeks of seeing the same people to avoid potential comments.
text:I had a teacher in high school who I realized basically had a capsule wardrobe for work - she had like 7 tops, a few cardigans, a few dresses and a couple pairs of pants/jeans and like one skirt. They all matched each other and she mixed them up so that she had a different outfit every day. I didn't notice until like halfway through the school year but once I did I thought it was pretty cool, and a great way to look nice for work and save money. She always looked good!	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Ah yes, strategizing when you wear which outfits because you want to wear an outfit multiple times but don't want to risk being seen wearing it twice.

text:Omg same!! I rarely rewear my sleeping clothes too because I sweat at night.	labels:Night sweating is a mood. I rewear a ton of my day to day clothes, because Im boring and like my light jacket/denim pants/chinos which probably aren't getting washed after one single wear regardless. Like undergarments and tshirts change, but people aren't seeing the former and the latter isn't particularly distinctive.  But my god if Im not washing pajamas or my misfitting sleep tshirts after one or two nights.	episode_done:True
text:What are your thoughts on outfit repeating multiple days in a row?	labels:I don’t do it consecutively because it’s too eye catching and people conclude all sorts of things (incl. you spent the night elsewhere and never returned home) and also I find it a bit boring to wear the same thing two days in a row when I have an audience of people observing my dress. But I will like wear the same outfit later in the week absolutely, or mix say a Monday pant into a Thursday outfit or a Tuesday top into a Friday outfit. My work “capsule” wardrobe is very limited because I wanted to have nice things for my job but not buy too many things.  On the weekends, I’ve been known to wear the same outfit Saturday and Sunday for sure but I don’t typically see the same people/go to the same places on both days  I think most people innately crave identity and variety especially if fashion is something that they enjoy. Not everyone need be that way though, and I encourage you to do whatever works best for you, even if you buy 5 of the same outfit and wear it exclusively all week, every week - that can be a look and a statement too	episode_done:True

text:Was in a zoom lecture the other day and my friend texted me asking if I was wearing the same shirt from yesterday... I was literally shocked, I didn't think people noticed or even cared that much (i'm actually still kinda weirded out by it...) especially as most of us are all working/learning from home these days. Usually I just wear the same pants or something, as that's not as noticeable, but with the pandemic, my outfit repeating game is *strong*.	labels:Oh man, that would make me so paranoid for all future Zooms!

text:What are your thoughts on outfit repeating multiple days in a row?	labels:So I did this for a week once as a social experiment.  I was sick of putting together new outfits everyday and was curious if people would notice. I wore the same blouse, blazer and pants for an entire work week (yes I washed them). I don’t remember if I changed my necklace or shoes at all. Hair and makeup are always the same for work so that wasn’t a factor.  Nobody commented or seemed to notice throughout the week. On Friday afternoon I asked people if they had noticed anything about my appearance and they said no, and when I told them about my experiment they seemed genuinely surprised!  The biggest surprise for ME was how bored I quickly became. I basically felt like a cartoon character and was excited to wear my other clothes again.  So no, I don’t think it matters, but if you plan on doing this long-term I would recommend buying multiples of the same item to eliminate excessive laundry.	episode_done:True

text:I am older than most here, I suppose. When I was in high school, dresses and heels were not unusual (in the mid-late 70's). I liked the variety of clothes I was able to wear and enjoyed "dressing up" once a week or more!  In college, daily clothes were jeans, blouses, sweaters. I had one friend who dressed to the nines everyday-makeup, hair, the works.  I admired her and I wish now that I would have followed her example. I was too afraid to stand out and also too lazy! I did only what I needed to do to stay a B student. Staying up late at parties makes it hard to wake up and do your hair. She was also at the top of the class (chemical engineering) and was a talented actress. I don't think she missed out on fun, but probably didn't have as many hangovers as I did.  I never went back to "daily dressy" at work (flats and trousers in the lab), but I didn't wear jeans every day until grad school.  My message- don't be afraid to stand out! Express yourself and you will have plenty of admirers. Encourage others to do the same.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:DAE feel a disconnect between fashion you see in movies or TV and fashion you see in real life?	labels:Don't forget that the clothes you see on TV or in films are costumes, even if it's not a "costume drama". They fit well on screen because the whole look has been designed - everyone's outfits, the setting and so on. So unless it's a deliberate choice everything is going to look cohesive. By deliberate choice I mean things like a character wearing obviously different clothes to most of the rest of the cast to show they're old fashioned, or quirky and so on.  I'm certainly not saying don't look to film and TV for inspo, but either try to modify what you see to more match where you are, or accept the fact you might look more dressed up than the majority and go with it anyway.	episode_done:True

text:What is your favorite clothing/accessories subscription box?	labels:I've tried Stitchfix, Nordstrom Trunk Club and MM Lafleur.   Stitchfix was just laughable, in one box I got a pair of skinny black jeans and a note from the "stylist" saying that since I lived in NYC I should own a pair. All the clothes were items you could get cheaper at Nordstrom Rack (really, I checked a few).   MM Lafleur was overpriced for the quality and I felt the clothes lacked personality, though I could see this being helpful to someone who doesn't know where to start with office wear.   Nordstrom was ok but they couldn't nail my style and what would work on my body. I ended up keeping a  couple of items though, I tend to shop in a specific brand segment and price range and they sent me items  from brands I would normally dismiss as "too basic" that turned out to be good. They were also more tuned into mainstream trends (I'm sure they have research on this). With a slightly higher hit rate I might have tried this one longer.  I've been offered personal shopping a few times but that was out of my spending comfort zone in the end.  I subscribe to Scentbox (fragrance subscription). You can get more bang for your buck with decant stores, I guess, but I think their packaging is really nice and it's a fun way to try new things.

text:What is your favorite clothing/accessories subscription box?	labels:I got free Stitchfix credit from a friend, so I've used Stitchfix a couple of times. (disclaimer: I haven't tried anything else). I was very specific about my body type in the profile section, and after the first box I was very specific to the stylist about what types of clothes I wanted to try and what I didn't like. There's also a small extra info box on your profile where you can mention specifics, e.g. looking for more business casual pieces, would never wear X things, live in a warm climate, etc.      I think styling services like Stitchfix work best when you know yourself well— for example, I'm petite, proportionally really short legs, and I know what doesn't work for me (animal prints, dots, shift dresses, low heels). I specifically noted items that I felt like had a low chance of success in terms of fit (e.g. jeans, blazers) and casual items (not worth the $$) as items that I did not want to receive.     The more specific you can be, the better a box you'll get. This does mean that you're less likely to need the help of a stylist to find pieces for you, but it can be fun to try on things you wouldn't have picked up on your own.	episode_done:True

Trunk Club was better though, their brands are more mainstream and pricier.

text:If you could get yourself one fashion gift, what would it be?	labels:I'd get a really nice piece of outerwear, either a coat in a quality material like wool or a leather or shearling jacket. If you live somewhere with colder weather during part of the year, outerwear is something you'll be wearing all the time so it's worth investing in a piece that's great quality, keeps you warm and makes a statement. I think an amazing jacket or coat will elevate even the most basic outfit, whether it's a more classic piece, something utilitarian like a puffer jacket or something more extravagant. Personally I think Acne, Chloe and Tibi are brands that make great high-end outerwear in a variety of styles.

text:If you could get yourself one fashion gift, what would it be?	labels:My milestone gifts the last few years have been Tiffany jewelry.

These have been for personal milestones, though, not professional. If I were celebrating a professional success, I'd probably buy a bag or something that I could carry all my work items in and still look fashionable and professional.	episode_done:True

text:If you could get yourself one fashion gift, what would it be?	labels:Jewelry. Real metal and stones. Whatever your personal style is.  I tend to mark milestones with a new piece. I like Native American made sterling with turquoise and I work in an artistic field, so these are signature pieces for me. $1k would get me a bracelet with a large, fine stone or a reasonably important squash blossom necklace. I also like to support Native artists and buy directly from them whenever possible; this is how many support their families and put food on their table.
text:I love this idea! My husband is Native and tribal-enrolled. We go back and visit family on the res during the holidays so I should make sure to stop by the tribe's artisan boutique. There are a lot of beautiful pieces that I've never felt like I could splurge on but this might be the right occasion!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:If you could get yourself one fashion gift, what would it be?	labels:I would upgrade some of what I already own and wear a lot to better quality versions, and save some to spend on good makeup.

text:What are your feelings on thrifting from “problematic” brands?	labels:The company already made money off of the original purchase of the shirt, so you buying second hand doesn’t really benefit them in any way.

text:I agree but this is also a slippery slope that I have personally succumbed to. If you can afford to spend a little more, Id say spend some time finding ethical brands that fit your style. They’re out there somewhere. The stuff I find on Poshmark usually is just okay fitting and i almost always find a good reason why the original owner wanted to sell it (e.g. slightly ill fitting.) instead of wasting money (and gas/materials because packages need to be packaged and shipped), take the time to research companies and KNOW YOUR MEASUREMENTS if you want to buy online.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:But the second question is where to buy second hand from? For example near me we have the Salvation Army and a church thrift shop. I used to live next to a giant Salvation Army donation center and loved it, but after learning about their philosophy and some of the shady things they’ve done I no longer feel like I can ethically support them! Then supporting the local church thrift is also problematic given their stances on social issues! When I lived in California I was able to find some thrift stores that actually gave to causes I support (out of the closet etc) but now that I’m in the Midwest there aren’t any of these! I just want like a thrift store that donates to something like education or food banks without the religious/social aspect.	labels:In my part of Canada, basically the only two thrift stores are Value Village (for-profit company which donates a portion of its proceeds to a diabetes charity), and Goodwill By Salvation Army (non profit/charity I believe? With a history of discrimination against LGBT community and poor treatment of workers with disabilities)   The most common reaction I get, when people say "where did you get that sweater" and I say "Value Village", is  "ewwww, didn't you know that's a for profit company! You're wasting your time buying used, you're so foolish thinking you're a good person when you're just supporting some *corporation*, that's so gross, you're just as bad as me so don't pat yourself on the back for shopping there, you capitalist!"   And like... Really?? Wtf is up with that response? I'd rather support a for-profit used clothing store, than a for-profit new clothing store like Walmart or Forever 21. Isn't doing something better than doing nothing? Or, as the saying goes," don't let perfection be the enemy of good?"    (especially when my only alternative to value village is... Pretty much the last charity I'd want my money going to)	episode_done:True

You'll be surprised at what you may find in your area that is not one of the big names. Most will have a FB page that you can check out who owns them. Another idea is there may be a store that is set up to do annual/seasonal pop up style consignment where they hold a sale from a Thursday-Saturday. And finally try Poshmark, while some folks like to do insane mark ups, there are other sellers who just want to move their stuff out. You can do offers and bundles that can help drive down the cost.	episode_done:True

text:I partially agree with you. But the company still benefit from second hand purchases.   The second hand price is based on supply/demand, buying the unethical brand even second hand shows demand and increase public perception of the brand then prices go up. That’s why some brands are still more expensive than others even in thrift store.  Yet if you like an unethical brand, like you said, buying second hand is better.	labels:Postmark and eBay are full of people who intentionally sell for secondary market. Might be worth looking into Goodwill online or something like that.

text:What are you wearing for Halloween this year?	labels:I won't be going out. I'm so fucking sad. Halloween is my absolute favorite, and it was going to be an epic party this year.  However! I'm still going to dress up because I want to. I have recently acquired a comically oversized witch hat, so I'll be building a costume around that. I shall be the most fabulous witch while watching not-so-scary movies, eating candy, and getting properly sloshed.

text:Black is Beautiful, Braids are Beautiful, Bald is Beautiful: Ayanna Pressley as an icon of feminine professionalism	labels:I think people just now are starting to really see the beauty in blackness, not just in fashion sense, which has always been apparent, but also in human terms.  I mean, black people or people of black skin color have been painted in very ugly and negative terms for hundreds if not thousands of years.  And that has been done by people of light skin color.  I have not seen a lot of examples of people of dark skin color vilifying people of white skin color, just based on their skin color alone.    This stuff has been around for thousands of years.  I think it really started with the Romans and the great lie they have perpetrated to steal the identity of Christ, because they could not contain the spread of Christianity despite the persecution of Christians after Christ's death.    The color black in fashion has always been wildly successful.  However, that success has never translated to black people or people of black skin color because of the concerted effort that has been done throughout millenia against them.  Black beauty is a light within which had been hidden from the world.  Despite efforts to reverse this coming to light, or as I would call it Black Enlightment, it is undeniable that this trend too is unstoppable.  Justice for All...	episode_done:True

text:Sustainability and "Indulgence" in Era of the Rona	labels:I would love to see these boots!   I’ve had good luck for myself at Goodwill lately too- a merino and a cotton knit chunky sweater that spark joy at the changing of the seasons, and a J. Crew Lady Day coat- $400 new, knee length, wool and thinsulate- that needs a little love and repair. I don’t know where the heck I’m going to wear it but since 3 strangers commented “that fits you perfectly” while I was standing at the mirror trying to figure out when I’ll ever have an occasion for it, I decided it was meant to be.	episode_done:True
text:Sustainability and "Indulgence" in Era of the Rona	labels:Love hearing about your UGG transformation!  While I have purchased probably my normal amount of items during Rona, I've been resisting the impulse to shop more often and have been pretty successful in seeking and finding those boosts from my existing closet.  I've been challenging myself to approach fashion as a **verb**, not just something that I buy.  Weirdly, when I did a pretty major closet clean out during quarantine, I ended up feeling like I owned \*more\* afterward.    Not nearly as dramatic a transformation as your Uggs, but yesterday I took my ankle boots to be resoled and a belt to be repaired.  Afterward I was like, dang, these are some sharp boots.  Focusing on decent quality within the context of my budget and taking care of my stuff has made me more thankful for the awesome stuff I own, and really how much I have.  I've done a lot of shopping my closet and making new fits out of existing items.  I've found myself feeling more of a sense of abundance and creativity, while I have identified a few gaps and have shopped a bit to fill them, I often have a sense of "I can't wait to wear all these great fits I created!"  \[while working from home as my son rolls his eyes at mom, lol\]  Which feels indulgent, fun, and gives me a boost without shopping.  Like you I also enjoy variety - I can't be a minimalist all the time, sometimes I want big colors, bold patterns, different looks.  Even so I'm finding I'm pretty happy with the mix of colors / patterns / neutrals that I own; my accessories go a long way, and I'm finding myself able to creatively achieve a lot of variety.  I won't pretend I never have the impulse to shop, I research a lot and I do resist that on a regular basis.  But I'm happy to report that I'm having a lot of fun with what I own already.	episode_done:True
text:Sustainability and "Indulgence" in Era of the Rona	labels:I’ve actually completely changed how I shop. I’ve been focusing on high-quality investment pieces rather than trend pieces. It’s definitely a lot slower to build my closet this way, but I just want a closet that I love so I can eventually just “shop” my closet every morning instead of always feeling the need to add to it. For a lot of my high end pieces, I’ve been going for secondhand sites so I don’t have to worry about quality or authenticity. Personally, I don’t mind spending several hundreds of dollars on a pair of designer shoes that I know I’m going to love for the next 10 year (and are actually made to last that long) rather than cycling through low end finds all the time. But that’s just me.	episode_done:True
text:Sustainability and "Indulgence" in Era of the Rona	labels:I've been conscious of the impact of just buying junk for a lot of years now, but the current state of the world is just hitting even harder now and it's even MORE important to me that the things I buy are:   1. useful with what I already own,   2. actually going to make me happy longer than the "new stuff" endorphin rush lasts,   3. actually functional and as well-made and low-fuss as possible.   I just want things that I can put on, take off, wash, hang, and wear again time and time again without it being a fight. The 'YAY NEW THING' glow wears off almost by the time you get the shipping notice, so there has to be more reward in it for it to be worth it. There's more joy to be had (more long-lasting joy anyway) with finding new ways to wear old things. If I can remix a piece 9 different ways, I feel pretty baller about it! So that's my focus. If adding something new to the mix will make the remixing easier for lots of other items (a blazer, for example, that means I can wear 5 other tops to work that I couldn't before) then it's probably a good purchase. So I suppose "shop with long-term remixing in mind" is probably my biggest suggestion.  Personally I haven't had much luck thrifting but that's probably due to a champagne taste fighting with a beer budget city. Can't find treasures when the stock isn't super great. That said, we're at least stellar for used outdoor clothing and gear, so I guess I can't complain there.	episode_done:True
text:Sustainability and "Indulgence" in Era of the Rona	labels:I've been on a fashion sustainability journey for a while now - in 2019 I vowed to only buy recycled fibers - and did so until early 2020. Somewhere along the line, I realized that's really not the best thing, and went on a no-buy.  Then I discovered depop.   I was pretty restrained to begin with, then, driven by my love for variety that is quite similar to yours, went on a bit of a spree of buying all the things I've been holding back from for a few years. That said, I probably only purchased 10-15 items in total, and out of those, only one has turned out to be a dud (slightly too small, will sell on), so I'm pretty pleased.  I also naturally tend to buy things that will fit with the rest of my closet, so I never had much of an issue there. It was a little difficult when I decided to transition from a very professional to a more "me" wardrobe, but I did it over time, and now I'm quite happy with how it's gone.   The thing I did recently is branch out into accessories - and I've been getting either second-hand/vintage, or unique handmade items from artisans. That's been a whole lot of fun, and I feel like I'm supporting the right people.  I don't have that many restoration tips, but I've learned some decent care tips over time. My favourite one at the moment concerns white shoes (sue me, I'm a sucker for them) - wipe them down every time you wear them and they likely won't require a huge clean at any point! Depending on where you go, of course. I also like to air out my clothing before I decide they absolutely need a wash, especially blazers. If you're persistent enough, most smells will dissipate over time. Just don't put anything in direct sunlight, colours might get washed out!	episode_done:True
text:Sustainability and "Indulgence" in Era of the Rona	labels:Well, I decided that becuase my current round of clothes is on its way out (bought three-four years ago, beginning and end of fifth grade) I’m sewing everything I can of the next one, and buying what I can’t custom (gloves, a scarf). Durable, in colours and materials I want, cheaper, and shouldn’t need replacing till the end of highschool (I started this year.). Added bonus is that I’ve never had a single store bought item fit before I altered it (I’ve altered everything I own at this point.) while stuff I sew fits first try. I posted my working list on r/capsulewardrobe recently.	episode_done:True
text:Sustainability and "Indulgence" in Era of the Rona	labels:I just did a very similar thing with a pair of boots I got for $7 at the thrift store. They’re a beautiful shade of light blue and were faded, stained and creased. I just knew I could clean them up though. Well, they came out looking almost brand new with a little leather cleaner and a LOT of conditioning! I was even able to iron out all the toe creases, which was a whole new level of satisfying

text:Sustainability and "Indulgence" in Era of the Rona	labels:I've purchased several pieces of secondhand jewelry, both from physical thrift shops and one big mixed lot on Ebay. With the work from home/daily video calls life, where nobody sees me for more than an hour at a time and from the collarbone up, lasting until who knows when, I've had the desire to change up my jewelry from simple and delicate, with a lot of long necklaces, to something more colorful, bold, and closer to the face.  It's all cheap costume jewelry that I wouldn't buy new, but with the environmental impact already made it's a fun addition. Everything has been cool toned (green and blue) to go with the color palette I've been feeling lately. It doesn't need to be comfortable all day, just show up on camera until I take it off. Some of it even has visible wear that would be too much for wearing in public, but it doesn't show up on camera, so video calls are a perfect way to expand its usable lifespan.

text:Sustainability and "Indulgence" in Era of the Rona	labels:I just found out about goodwill outlet bins recently and I am soooooo excited about the idea of going there , but I'm scared to go during COVID because I'm personally following a "only go to stores where I can maintain 6 ft social distancing space at all times" policy. I heard online that people get really intense at the outlet bins, and get right in your face and elbow you out of the way to grab clothes and all that stuff. I'm very curious, what are your personal experiences? Should I feel safe checking it out/are there new safety rules in place, or should I wait for a few months?
text:It depends on the location. My local one is not as disgusting as you sometimes hear, but it is absolutely people everywhere. An hour and a half away, everything is meticulously monitored and clean.   The hullaballoo generally occurs around the new bins that they bring out. I find that most people do the first layer or so and move on so if you dig deeper, there's still good stuff left there. I don't crowd for new bins even pre-COVID and when everyone's in the new bins, it gives you a lot of space to peruse literally every other bin in there.	labels:Thanks for the reply! That's so weird that people only do the first layer, wouldn't they want to check through the whole bin?	episode_done:True

text:How many handbags do you have and which one is your most used?	labels:I tend to keep one large daily purse. I prefer real leather, but it doesn't have to be designer, just well-made. This bag gets the most use (and abuse), and when it wears out, I replace it.  I have one casual bag that I bought easily a decade ago. It's the ThinkGeek Handbag of Holding, and it has so many pockets. It was my daily bag at a different phase of my life. It isn't dressy enough for the office, but I'll use it on camping/beach trips when I don't want to throw my work purse into the sand.  I also have 4-5 smaller purses that I've received as gifts over the years. I don't use those very often, as I prefer larger bags, but I save them for job interviews, weddings, and other special occasions. And since they don't get much use, they tend to stay in great condition.	episode_done:True

text:How many handbags do you have and which one is your most used?	labels:Currently, I have two Coach and one Kate Spade, but I tend to carry the same bag every day.

If I wanted a luxury bag like Chanel, I would either have to dip into savings for it or put it on credit (which is a no-no for me).

text:Tips for reducing impulse buying/careless spending?	labels:I think buying *nothing* except bills and groceries might be a little unrealistic, given that you've slipped up a few times. Can you give yourself a small budget? Personally, I have a yearly budget for clothing. Some months I spend nothing, some months I spend more, but it's all bugeted for.  Overspending on clothes can come from treating shopping as a hobby. I switched from browsing online stores to looking at high fashion photo shoots and shows. Still scratches the fashion itch. But you can't exactly impulse buy a $10,000 dress.   Can you also try focusing on other, non-fashion related hobbies? Reading is a great one for me, and I don't spend anything on it because my local libraries are awesome.	episode_done:True
text:Tips for reducing impulse buying/careless spending?	labels:I've been in the same boat!   This may be counterintuitive but I had to be honest with myself about how much I love dressing up: a while ago I decided to make space in my budget for clothes after I tried spending $0 and failed miserably. Paired with a closet assessment of needs vs wants AND actually making a monthly budget, I've been able to curb my impulse purchases.	episode_done:True
text:Tips for reducing impulse buying/careless spending?	labels:First step is to be realistic and honest with yourself. Unless we’re talking about crippling debt or something you can’t pay off within 9-12 months while still living comfortably, there’s no reason to cut all spending. Just scale it back and make a small shopping budget for yourself.   Consistency pays off debt better and faster than trying to bite off more than you can chew. Take it easy and be realistic, you’ll be okay!	episode_done:True
text:Tips for reducing impulse buying/careless spending?	labels:Download a budgeting app so you can visualize what you're spending and get alerts if you're overspending in a certain category. Or if you want to put in more effort, make your own spreadsheet.   If you want to be hardcore, you could make a separate debit card that is ONLY for non-necessity expenses--and fill that every month with $XX   -----  Also, don't buy stuff for the future or imaginary events. When I was younger and just earning my own pocket cash, I'd buy fancy dresses that I literally had no occasion to wear, just because they looked good on me lol. They weren't expensive, but they were unnecessary expenses.    Buy stuff when you need it. Only exception being CRAZY good deals on stuff you will actually need.	episode_done:True
text:Tips for reducing impulse buying/careless spending?	labels:On top of what you’ve already done and what everyone else is suggesting I would add spending less time online if possible!

text:Tips for reducing impulse buying/careless spending?	labels:When I did a shopping detox a few years ago, I found that using shopping to fill time was as big an issue for me as wanting new things. Yes, the fun of the purchase and desire to wear something new contributed to shopping. But the bigger issue for me was that I used shopping to fill downtime. It was an issue at in-person stores, e.g. in between a fitness class and work, and at home when I had plenty of time for online shopping. I had to find other ways to fill my time. I took walks between errands and tasks. I did some errands and maintenance work that I'd been putting off. I read and exercised more. It helped me see how much time I was dedicating to shopping and how much time I had available for other things if I shifted priorities a bit.	episode_done:True
text:Tips for reducing impulse buying/careless spending?	labels:Organize & clean everything I already own before I buy.   For example, if I want to buy another pair of jeans & a top, I do my laundry and put it all away and have my closet looking uncluttered. Often I just want the feeling of something clean & new. It also helps me purchase items I might actually wear more often because as I put items away I think about how much I enjoy/wear them and why	episode_done:True

text:Tips for reducing impulse buying/careless spending?	labels:Here are a few things that helped me get over a skincare addiction:  - Unsubscribe from emailed coupons and deals. Just bc it's on sale doesn't mean you need it.    - Unsubscribe from subreddits (yes, here included if you often get the urge to buy after seeing inspo) and YouTube videos of "hauls" or whatever else makes you want to purchase. Pinterest, maybe?   - Make a list of things you need/want and ONLY buy those things  - Put items in your cart and wait 2 days or more.   - If you don't already, get a budget app (every dollar is free) and use it.	episode_done:True
text:Tips for reducing impulse buying/careless spending?	labels:Remove yourself from the mailing list for all shopping vendors that you have coming into your inbox. They'll tempt you every time you get a notification. Likewise, maybe take a break from any of the fashion social media items that you follow, Instagram, Pinterest, certain subreddits.  &#x200B;  This advice might sound really weird, but I actually did this successfully a couple times during the initial shutdown. I caught a couple of those amazing sales and I added a lot items. I got a really good  "ooo 75% off!" high. Then I looked at the cart and logged off. I never actually purchased the items. I got the shoppers' high, but I didn't spend any of my actual money.	episode_done:True
text:What style rules or clothing attributes are you ruthless about?	labels:Also, this is a common rule, but no clothing that requires anything special to wear it - eg a shirt that only works when you switch around the bra straps of your convertible bra, a dress that requires shapewear to look how you want it to look, a wrap blouse that has to be pinned into place after you put it on, a shirt that requires another shirt underneath because it’s see-through - all of those are a no for me. If it doesn’t work with just my regular underclothing (except for choosing nude underclothing for light pieces) I won’t buy it - I just know by now I’m not going to make the effort to wear it when I could just put on something easier that I like just as much.

text:I only get business outerwear pieces that are dry clean only. For example, blazers, slacks, stiff skirts, etc. I find that I don’t need to clean these pieces after every wear, not to mention I only wear them once, maybe twice a week and only during the school year (I’m part of a coed business fraternity). I find that the dry clean only versions of these items are sturdier and made of thicker material than the non dry clean only versions so it’s worth it to me to take those in once a month or every other month depending on level of wear.	labels:	episode_done:True

They started to fall by the wayside after I had a kid and was tired of getting spit-up on them, and now I live in a house that requires me to drive to a cleaners. Screw that.   I still wear the merino sweaters from Uniqlo all the time but machine wash them on gentle and hang dry, and because they’re $40 I don’t mind if they occasionally go through the dryer by mistake (they don’t shrink much).     All done cleaners, as my toddler used to say.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Rant - I'm fed up with fashion and "expressing myself"	labels:Pssst. You don't need to look "in" the way you think you do. Your clothes don't have to look like you bought them all this year. You are allowed to repeat outfits. You don't HAVE to consciously try to express yourself through clothes. You don't constantly have to try to visually display a personality to strangers. You can opt out and wear simple outfits like 90% of everyone. It's OK.     Sometimes the pressure feels suffocating, I know. But it's OK to not follow every trend. Despite what some posters in this sub think, the vast majority of people will not notice that you bought your jumper/coat/whatever in 2018. I actually like clothes and fashion but sometimes I'm too tired and just do the uniform thing. I just try changing how I do my makeup if I feel bored now, before trying to remix my whole wardrobe. I gave myself new eyebrows and tried a different style of eyeliner and I look different enough people asked if I had a hair cut (lol) which didn't involve even buying new makeup.    As for comments on my appearance, if they aren't nice or helpful ("You haven't blended your concealer" "You have leaves in your hair" "your shirt has popped open") I ignore it.	episode_done:True

I have a few dresses that I wear on occasion. The irony is that I used to get in trouble all the time over uniform violations growing up. Like OP, I love fashion and the fashion other people wear, but it's just too much of a whole "thing" to try to express myself through fashion, especially because shopping for "new" clothes is part of that.

text:Revisiting Tim Gunn's List of 10 Style Must-haves	labels:To me, this is “wardrobe staples if you have a traditional office job with a business dress code” tbh. I do, so I own a version of most of these, but that kind of work environment is less and less common, and I think a lot of women no longer have much use for blazers, trench coats, dress pants, etc.
text:I feel like this list can be modernized by stating an item's function, rather than defining what the items themselves should be.   For instance, instead of the blazer and dress pants, the description "an outfit well-suited for a professional job interview" would work well, and then one could discuss various pieces that could work within these constraints, such as a well-fitting cardigan and a pencil skirt.   Instead of a "little black dress," what they really mean is "an easy and versatile somewhat-formal piece" that's suitable for anything from a work happy hour to a holiday party and is easy to dress up or down. Doesn't have to be a dress, doesn't have to be black, but something that has the same level of versatility and formality that's appropriate for multiple occasions.   Instead of "classic white shirt," could mean a "versatile neutral top" that can be coordinated multiple ways across multiple contexts, worn casually on its own or as a foundation piece under a pantsuit. "Trench coat" is similar--a piece of outerwear that has trend longevity and can be worn atop most outfits, but obviously this changes depending on your climate; a down coat could fill this wardrobe niche if you're somewhere cold.	labels:	episode_done:True

What other people are spending on conservative blazers, pencil skirts, button-down shirts, etc. I'm usually spending on dresses, fun printed items, and cute accessories, as well as more loungewear-type stuff to wear while working.	labels:	episode_done:True

I do, so I own a version of most of these, but that kind of work environment is less and less common, and I think a lot of women no longer have much use for blazers, trench coats, dress pants, etc.
text:Thanks for this. I’ll wear a couple of those items because work says I MUST, but I don’t want or need the rest.  If I’m having a sweatpants day, I will accept it’s a sweatpants day, and not spend more money on an alternative for something that’s already doing what I need it to.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:I tend to agree. I think most women today who have office jobs would probably actually feel overdressed in a fitted blazer, not to mention outside of the office. I personally own a black blazer that I think I've worn to two interviews, and that's about it.  In fact, I think I would just update the list to replace a blazer with some sort of cardigan. I feel they fit in with a wider range of styles than a fitted blazer does at this point.	labels:Its jeans and t-shirts at my job. Maybe... someone wears a polo. Higher-ups dress more professional, though. Wearing even business casual can feel like one is overdressed.	episode_done:True

text:I was actually coming here to say just this. I don't own or need over half of this list for my lifestyle. I work in an office that is fairly casual so I'm not sure what I would do with dress pants or a blazer or even a "classic" white top. I also think that having a trench coat really depends on the weather where you live. I need light jackets that keep me dry not long coats for fashions sake.	labels:I live in California, so almost no one I know has a wardrobe like this. (but not LA)  Our list would be something like:  flip flops that you can wear to the beach or to lunch  casual dress you can throw over a swimsuit or go out in  jean shorts or crop jeans  Patagonia jacket lol  The outfit for whatever sport you're into whether that is cycling, tennis, etc. You wear this when you've done your sport and are then running other errands.  Big fat down coat for when you're complaining about the weather dipping below 50   Trendy workout clothes for going to the grocery store   Bunch of boho tops  1000 beanies   Fin.	episode_done:True

text:It's a dated list that only worked for a specific kind of person/lifestyle in a very specific kind of climate/weather. Even thinking of my most successful friends, none of these are relevant to my life or that of my peers, except for jeans lol. It's funny how alien it actually is, when they're supposedly "must haves".	labels:Weirdly, I’m very much a person to whom the list is totally applicable, since I wear suiting to work so I own and wear multiples of almost everything on the list.   But because of that I know exactly how unusual that is, I think, since literally no one in my social circle has the same kind of work wardrobe I have and I’ve seen so much here about what most people consider “work appropriate” but would *never* be acceptable for me. I feel like I work in the world’s last (not business formal) office where jeans are not even a possibility and suit jackets (even ties for men) are the norm, not unusually formal.   I hope that once covid is over and I go back to the office, things will relax a little since we’ve been seeing each other in tees and sweaters over Zoom for so long, but I have a feeling I’m still gonna have to yank on some hosiery and a blazer and toddle on back in my pumps like no one ever saw me wearing a pair of purple floral leggings chasing my dog out of a room on a videoconference.	episode_done:True
text:Revisiting Tim Gunn's List of 10 Style Must-haves	labels:This list honestly matches pretty well with my wardrobe, even in the time of Corona. Though some pieces I bought well before I grew into them stylistically:  - Classic black trench coat: I bought this in college but it was easily 8 years before I really felt comfortable wearing it regularly. Still looks great though :)  - Patterned skirt: have had this since high school 0-0. Didn't really wear it from about age 18-26, but it's still a fantastic piece that I wore regularly to work and will again.  I went through a phase where I threw a blazer over *everything* so I still have a bunch, including one that lived in my office if I had to go into a client meeting on short notice.	episode_done:True
text:Revisiting Tim Gunn's List of 10 Style Must-haves	labels:No. I work outside. I have no use for a lot of these items.   I need my closet to flatter me AND be physically functional.	episode_done:True
text:Revisiting Tim Gunn's List of 10 Style Must-haves	labels:*  little black dress     * I think any solid color dress for semi-formal occasions that can be dressed down to casual or dressed up to business casual are good to keep on hand for emergencies when you don't have time to find anything in particular for an event if you don't typically have events to go to. Patterns can make a dress over casual and sometimes date it, and black can wash a lot of people out. I have a jeweltone purple dress than compliments my red hair and it's my staple dress.  * trench coat    * Have one, love one, makes me feel put together in the fall and spring when I'm wearing my lovely frumpy sweaters and my only pair of waterproof boots.  * classic dress pants    * Personally, no - my office is more good jeans with a top than dress pants, and there's no scenario outside my office in which I'd wear a pair.  * versatile skirt    * I have a black circle skirt and a black mini skirt that goes with all of my sweaters and all of my tank tops. When you want to feel dressy but not too dressy, it's a good go-to, otherwise replace with dress pants if that's your vibe.  * fitted blazer    * I never remember that I own one, but wouldn't invest unless you're a blazer person or you meet clients in a professional setting.  * classic white shirt    * For the longest time, I didn't think these were necessary, but they so are. I have a plain white tee, a ruffled sleeve tee, and a white button up shirt because in a pinch I can wear them with everything.  * day dress    * No? replace with anything that's throw on comfort but looks chic with a good pair of shoes. Feel like nowadays it's more romper, jumpsuit, etc than just a standard wrap dress.  * cashmere sweater    * Literally cannot think of when I'd want a cashmere sweater, the care for these is annoying.  * well fitting jeans    * A game changer * sweatsuit alternative    * fight me in my joggers * a wildcard item    * I don't drop cash on things that go out of style as a temporary trend.	episode_done:True

text:Capsule wardrobes?	labels:I have a capsule wardrobe for my corporate work wear cause I don't like having to think about what I wear. It's about 20 pieces, mainly navy, black and white with a couple of floral pieces for a statement. But my everyday casual wear I tried a capsule but decided against it. I enjoy experimenting with styles and different outfits too much. I found a capsule too limiting for my casual wear.	episode_done:True
text:Capsule wardrobes?	labels:real question - what's the difference between "capsule" and "uniform"? I have a tendency to wear the same thing, or very similar things
text:In my book a capsule is more oriented on the mix and match part - where things are cohesive and fit together. E.g. my wardrobe is the following colors and my 3 blouses can easily pair with my 5 bottoms of all types.    But the uniform is more like I always wear these shapes and these items - there is a standard structure to my outfits - black pants, neutral t-shirt, jean jacket.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Capsule wardrobes?	labels:The concept of a capsule closet is intriguing. My closet is a behemoth, but I always find myself enjoying my outfits more when living out of a suitcase (rip pre-covid travel).   I don’t want to truly empty my closet out, but started to dedicate one clothing rail to the seasonal attempt at bringing a capsule wardrobe together. Tbh, I’ll never be a genuine capsule wardrobe person.	episode_done:True
text:Capsule wardrobes?	labels:I love the idea of them \[Less decision making for me!  More time in the morning! Less clutter!\], but in practice they don't work great for me \[I get bored easily, I like a variety of styles, I love to play with clothes\].  I'm working on figuring out what 'styles' I enjoy, and a few pieces that would fit each style, so that I can have maximum options with a minimal(dish) amount.       I've been working on creating a capsule just for work though - even though my job skews casual, there are some safety rules that I should abide by when I'm in the lab space like long pants and closed toe shoes.  Plus, I seem to be more productive when I'm dressed more business-y.  I haven't figured out how to separate them in my closet though since we don't have a ton a space in our loft.	episode_done:True
text:Capsule wardrobes?	labels:I use a capsule when I travel. I stick to the same few colours, in re-mixeable pieces:  &#x200B;  |Item|Colour| |:-|:-| |T-shirt|white, black| |Blouse|white| |Collared dress shirt|white with grey pinstripe| |Blouse|dark navy blue| |Cardigan|grey| |Blazer|grey, black, and white tweed| |Pants|burgundy trousers| |Pants|olive trousers| |Pants|denim| |Pants|comfortable leggings| |Dress|knee-length black sheath dress| |Skirt|burgundy pencil skirt| |Tights|opaque black| |Flats|black leather| |Heels|black leather| |Earrings|simple studs, elaborate studs| |Necklace|dainty pendant| |Watch|simple and masculine|  With this, I feel like I'm ready for anything: a lecture, a meeting, a dinner with family, dinner out with friends.  I used to overload my suitcase with special pieces or statement pieces, and I would wear them once each (if that). It took me a long time to realize that, for me, a trip is not the time to use unique pieces. I need combine-able things that look cohesive.	episode_done:True
text:Capsule wardrobes?	labels:I love love the concept of "Capsule wardrobes". Maybe other people find it restricting but I find it liberating. I get easily overwhelmed with too many choices (I also tend to feel guilty when I see a piece I haven't worn for a long time like I wasted my money and that it is harmful for the environment). I have put an effort in buying less but buying a quality piece (for the environment ya know) so all I need is 20 pieces of clothing.  I usually include a couple of trendy pieces. a leather jacket. a fur jacket. a nice tan color wool jacket. another beige wool jacket. 2-3 high-waisted trouser/tailored-pants. 1 denim jean. 1 white blouse. Sometimes I include dresses and skirts depend on the season. I usually don't include skirts and dresses though because they are not as versatile but I tend to keep a beige silk wrap skirt.  Since I own less, I am able to care for each item more. Each piece is very loved.	episode_done:True
text:Capsule wardrobes?	labels:I have one. It works for both my office job and casual life as I like to be dressed up when I go out. It has around 12 pieces, not including shoes,undergarments or accessories. They're in neutral colors and my pop of color comes through my accessories (normally glasses or shoes but sometimes jewelry). I love it. I've paired it down to things I actually wear and slowly I've been replacing my fast fashion items when they're beyond wear with things that match my morals now. it's def a bit more pricier now but I feel good wearing them and know they'll last.	episode_done:True
text:Capsule wardrobes?	labels:I just did the same thing! I created a test capsule and put it in a specific section of my closet. I dressed exclusively from it for 2-3 weeks, and still mostly am (I ordered a couple of wish list items so I added those when they arrived).  I also felt like it was easier to get dressed (fewer choices) and my outfits were more in line with my desired style. That’s actually why I did my capsule — I came to the end of about two years of style exploration and wanted to test whether the conclusions I came to were right for me. They are!   Here’s the list of what I put in my warm weather capsule. I have another list ready for when the weather gets consistently cooler:  [x]2 sundresses  [x]Navy midi skirt  [x]Navy-based floral midi skirt  [x]Pink-based floral midi skirt  [x]2 pairs athletic / long shorts suitable for hiking/adventures – tan long & navy athletic  [x]Floral-print jersey-knit top  [x]Floral-print blouse  [x]Coral top (I think I ended up adding a second one of these so I wouldn’t have to do laundry)  [x]Navy top  [x]Chambray button-down shirt  [x]2 athletic tops for hiking/adventures  [x]1 pair dark green joggers  [x]Brown leather sandals  [x]Gray casual sneakers  [x]Adventure shoes  [x]Gold & rhinestone necklace  My colors are navy, coral/pink, dark green, and a little yellow.   I’ve been outfit repeating a ton for the last several months (wearing the same outfit for 3-5 days in a row), so that made doing a capsule easier as well.	episode_done:True

text:It took me years to figure this out! I love shopping for my aspirational life where I host elegant but casual outdoor dinner parties, wear tasteful, high end fashion, risk getting snapped by the paparazzi when I leave a store, and don't profusely sweat when it's over 75 degrees. But in reality, I am a lawyer who spends the time I'm not wearing suits, wearing mostly athleisure since my real life activities are working out, taking our dog to the park, hiking, and sometimes working on cars.   For me, it's been helpful as I've developed my style to create go-to outfits that make me feel put together based on various occasions that I actually would need to wear (at least, pre-CoViD): work dinners, running errands when it's hot out, brunch with friends, etc. I also have found my style has changed over time as I go through various seasons of life.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Yes this! I call it “ideal style” and “real style”. My “ideal style” involves a lot of flowy, Christy Dawn-style dresses.

text:Yes, I agree, I think OP has this "hopeful me" style and a "realistic me" style to please her family. I think OP can sprinkle a little bit of her alternative style with her casual everyday wear. For example, wear your regular t-shirt and jeans but add a cool black leather jacket. You can never go wrong with a piece like that and it's not too offensive.  Or, you can dress to satisfy your family but wear a darker color up top. Or add cool spike earrings.   I think you can combine the two styles so that you can satisfy your family and call your style "alternative".	labels:In a related sense, I've sometimes found that I can find a slightly different "style" that gives the same effect on my body. It won't be the exact same clothes/colors/cuts that I see posted elsewhere or on models, but choose something that, on the hanger, doesn't necessarily give the same impression and it will turn out that, on my body, it will give a similar effect because of drape or how the colors look on me. So I can sometimes find a way to have the same aesthetic even though the "original" version of the styles don't look/fit right.	episode_done:True
text:Can you have a clothing style without actually wearing that certain style much?	labels:I wouldn't, but only because I think that when you're describing your style, you're aiming to give other people an idea of what you actually wear, day to day, as concisely as possible.  If even your basic looks have alternative elements, it might make sense, otherwise there's nothing wrong with "basic, occasionally grunge-y."  That said, you don't only have to stick to one style, and it's not as though it's not part of you because you're not wearing it all the time.	episode_done:True

The billowier the better -- I'm talking sleeves like an emperor, pant legs like you're riding out to drive the cattle back to the barn -- you generate your own tiny airflow vectors. Keep a puffy and some slipper boots in your car because if you wanna watch the sun set over the ocean, your stupid idiot desert body can no longer regulate and you're huddled near death at 65° and windy.  Brooklyn winter: lightweight to midweight merino wool underlayers, because sweating in your synthetics on the train will make you smell like Manhattan. Your black merino turtleneck is literally your best friend and you would kill and die for it. Don't put your cold feet into your winter-weight wool socks because they will stay that way. Put em in a hot sink first if you have to. Also, if you wear your cute boots you will step on slushy shit of indeterminate origin and that's life in the big city, baby. Pick a coat that comes down pretty far because that river wind tunneling through the city architecture will send the kiss of death UP your cervix. Free instant sterilization though! And don't forget your lip balm.

text:Women who have moved for extended periods of time on 1 or 2 suitcases only, how did you do it? Here's the beginning of my process	labels:How permanent is the move? If it's only a couple of months then you could also just bring a couple of basic items and leave space in your bag to buy new clothes in your destination. This is what I did when I studied abroad for a year. The clothes are then also a nice souvenir for yourself.   If it's a long term or permanent, again just bring the things you absolutely love the most then buy things there. You can also have your other closed shipped to you in a parcel if you really can't do without them. Obviously if it's a permanent move the issue of fitting everything in a suitcase to bring home isn't really an issue.   Depending on what climate your moving from and to you might find you don't have enough clothes for said climate. For example, I moved UK to Japan, and I absolutely did not have enough clothes for the hot, humid summers here.  The same goes for culture. Many of my friends ended up having to throw away all of their tanktops and lowcut blouses because they're not culturally appropriate here.   It's also really common to change size when moving to another country because of diet and lifestyle changes. So you could find that all the clothes you bring no longer fit you after a few months.  The only longterm move situation where it's better to bring everything is if it'll be difficult to find your size where you're moving. For example if you're 6' and moving to east asia you'll have a hard time finding clothes
text:It's a year now but might become two (Depends on the opportunities pending over there) but buying clothing where I'm going can be quite expensive, and shipping would be really expensive too since it would be from one side of the world to quite literally the other.  I don't think it'll be difficult to find clothing my size for emergencies I'm pretty average size 8/10 5'3. But I'll keep the size change in mind, I do tend to fluctuate weight and I hadn't considered that at all. Thank you!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Women who have moved for extended periods of time on 1 or 2 suitcases only, how did you do it? Here's the beginning of my process	labels:Wear extra jackets and jewelry during your travels. Put extra necklaces through a straw and clasp the ends on the outside so they don’t tangle. If you have anything fragile wrap it in clothing rather than newspaper. Keep anything heavy in your personal item/ backpack to avoid overweight items. Jeans or black bottoms go with just about everything and allow you to mix up your outfit. Also roll your clothes rather than folding them flat for optimal space and consider buying a Turkish towel rather than traditional bath towel	episode_done:True
text:Women who have moved for extended periods of time on 1 or 2 suitcases only, how did you do it? Here's the beginning of my process	labels:If you are moving to one place/country for 1-2 years, I recommend packing only what you really love and wear a lot right now. In 1-2 years you will buy new clothes in your new country pretty much no matter what.    Test pack and use vacuum bags to get extra room. Leave behind anything bulky and if you really miss it, arrange for someone to ship it to you. Do all the other usual travel tips like wear your bulkiest stuff on the plane.    Last: just pay the extra luggage expense. Not sure your situation, but if you can't leave something behind and you'll miss it, just pay whatever extra you need to if it won't break your bank.	episode_done:True

text:How do you know when something doesn't fit perfectly?	labels:Ok so quick and dirty - shoulder seams are supposed to hit at your shoulder bone. This can be hard to determine if that bone isn't visible, but if the jacket is poufing out past your shoulder its too big at the shoulder and if there's a weird crease line or dimple when your arm is straight down it is likely too small at the shoulder. Armholes should be comfortably sized, not digging in to your pit but also not having excess folds of fabric around and inside the sleeve.  Pants should sort of skim over your hips and bum/thighs depending on the fit. This doesn't apply to skinny jeans and leggings which are meant to be tight fitting. If youre getting lines whiskering out from the crotch towards your hips, your pants are probably too small. If you get a fake penis bump, assuming you don't have one, the pants are probably too big (if you do have one, this tip does not apply!)  Ease is important. Just bc something fits over your body doesn't mean it fits you, especially with stiffer, non stretch fabrics. You need room in the butt and thighs to be able to sit down reasonably comfortably. If you can't bend without fabric digging in (especially at creases) it does not fit. If it balloons out significantly when you move or sit, the garment is likely too big.	episode_done:True
text:How do you know when something doesn't fit perfectly?	labels:You can get a suit jacket or blazer tailored. It’s so important to make sure the shoulders hit right where they’re supposed to, and that any buttons on the front can be properly buttoned. A suit jacket that doesn’t fit properly looks unprofessional. Sleeves can definitely be shortened if required.	episode_done:True
text:How do you know when something doesn't fit perfectly?	labels:I'm 5"4, which means regular suit skirts and work dresses are a bit long but petite alternatives are a bit short, so I get the lengths hemmed. Ditto with my suit jackets and wool coats, if feasible.	episode_done:True

text:How do you know when something doesn't fit perfectly?	labels:I always have to alter jeans myself.  Apart from being too long most of the time they are always loose around the knees and ankles.   Leggings or yoga pants are often too long and they gather or gape around the ankles.	episode_done:True
text:How do you know when something doesn't fit perfectly?	labels:I think just occasionally you find something that fits perfectly and you just know! Sometimes it depends on the garment as some have more leeway than others. Giveaways for a bad fit are as already mentioned with shoulder seams etc. Buttons pulling, waistbands not being flat to the waist at the back etc	episode_done:True
text:How do you know when something doesn't fit perfectly?	labels:The most basic thing, fundamental, objective thing is if it uncomfortable or impedes your movements. Some of this you only figure out when you wear things particularly if they are too loose (too tight you usually notice faster), like tops or dresses too big their neckline might move a bit and look askew, or you step on the hem of skirts or dresses at you climb stairs. Skirts too tight might ride up, pants too tight might dig and create camel toe or the zipper give way and open...  For other things, say pant or skirt length it might be a matter of aesthetics, 5 or 10 cm lower or higher..  Probably the most important point for things to fit is the shoulders and armpits, so it does not impede movement and because outerwear, tops, etc, hangs literally from there. If fitted, the seam should be at the edge of your shoulder blade naturally.  Not everything can be altered to fit right. There might not be enough fabric for that, or it might just a design which was cut for different proportions than yours. Tailoring can do subtle tweaks, on woven fabrics (knits are harder, way harder), but the first and most important step of getting clothes which fit well is REJECTING things, lots of things, most things, almost all things. Trying many many things, being analytical so you can learn stuff (if it looks like that chances are it will loook  this other thing on my body, Brand X pants always fit me right and Brand Y pants never).

text:A note on knits--if it's 100% wool and it isn't washable, you can actually sew it up and cut (similar to a method called steeking, which is used to create sleeves in faire isle sweaters), fold the inner seams over and sew. The wool will felt to itself after a handwashing or two and the sewing keeps it together well because of the pull the woll fibers have on one another. It can be scary to try, but with practice it can really change how a sweater fits and is great. I've done it on sweaters I've handknit myself in particular, but wanted to mention it here in case anyone is thinking about wool items going into the colder months!	labels:	episode_done:True

text:What do you get tailored?	labels:I get almost everything other than lounge clothes tailored. Size number means absolutely nothing anymore. Buy clothes that fit the widest part of your body, and have them taken in to fit the rest (it’s harder to let out than take in). Some of my dresses are 6s, and some are 0s, so size is literally just a made up concept for women. This definitely gets expensive, but I add the cost of tailoring to the cost of the thing I know I’ll need tailored.   So like, if I see a skirt I really want, but I’ll need the waist taken in, I know that my tailor streamlines waistbands with a zipper for 30 bucks. 35 if there’s a lining. That turns a $50 skirt into an $80 skirt. Do I really want to spend $80 on a skirt?? Maybe. If I do, I’ll buy it. If not, I put it back. It ends up saving me money because I buy less impulse trendy purchases.   Find a good tailor by testing them on cheap pieces and building a reputation. Eventually, you’ll know exactly how much they charge for each fabric/type of alteration and it helps with keeping prices in mind while shopping. A good tailor will have no problem at all with silks or satins. You may have to burn through a few and have them ruin some clothes before you find your soulmate, but it’s totally worth it! I recently broke up with my tailor and I’m still heartbroken about it..

text:Why did you break up with them?	labels:She could not for the life of her take something in at the zipper. Anytime something had a side zip and I needed the bodice taken in, it would end up all lopsided because she would only take out fabric from the opposite side. It wasn’t a huge deal, but she would get really upset if I asked to have something redone, and I noticed over time she would rush the easier jobs and they would end up a little sloppy. At her high prices, I got tired of being nervous about how something would turn out, so I stopped going. Now looking for a new tailor and starting the whole process over again 🙃	episode_done:True
text:What do you get tailored?	labels:My mom got me a beautiful micro suede blue jacket last fall, but it was pretty bulky. I had it tailored to fit and I love it. Specifically the upper sleeves were tightened and the waist was pulled in.  *it even has pockets.	episode_done:True
text:What do you get tailored?	labels:TBH? Everything. Pants, shirts, jackets. I tend to dress modestly, so if the hem of my dress or skirt are long enough, I'll get them brought down to lengthen the garment. But in regards to dresses, I've had sleeves shortened, necklines lowered and raised, a LOT of dresses taken in, etc. When it comes to fabric, if the dress is made out of a cheap, or flimsy material, I'll only get it tailored if I think the fabric is worth it. So unless the 100% polyester was crafted well, I don't think it's worth trying to save the garment. My general rule of thumb is that if I believe that the tailoring will be more expensive than the total cost of the garment, then it's not worth getting it tailored/buying the garment. I'd rather save up to get a better garment than do what I believe is wasting my money.	episode_done:True
text:What do you get tailored?	labels:Speaking of silk...I got some wide leg silk blend trousers from uniqlo last fall and the waistband was flappy in the front. There was an elastic in the gathered back so that was fine but there was no stretch to the silk in front so I them in for some darts.   They fit perfectly now! They are (.....were?!?!) great work pants and I got a lot of use out of them last fall.   I also got a really nice red trench coat tailored to fit. It cost about as much to get the coat tailored as it cost to buy but it looks great now! It was slightly too wide before. It fit pretty good in the sleeves and it was good on my shoulders but it was too boxy and now it’s much more tailored!!	episode_done:True

text:What do you get tailored?	labels:I started getting my clothes tailored last year and the difference is incredible. Looked like I lost a ton of weight and I gained so many compliments on my clothes. It makes cheap clothing (but well made) look expensive!  The alternations were mostly taking dresses/tops in at the waist and shortening the length of some long dresses and skirts to make them closer to knee length.	episode_done:True
text:What do you get tailored?	labels:Take a similar shirt of different fabric in to get tailored and see how your like the experience and their workmanship. Then bring silk shirts in to ask if they think they can improve the fit neatly.  Honestly anytime someone says silk is hard to work with, I roll my eyes. Maybe it is for people with less experience with it the first time they sew it. But I am not by any stretch of the imagination a skilled seamstress (I would say I am an intermediate hobby sewist), and I love silk of all kinds.  My sister (who is actually a pro) says the same thing about stretch. Even very experienced sewists sometimes avoid stretch out of fear or describe it as very difficult, but she laughs because she taught herself to sew by fitting her jersey t shirts in high school to be tighter. It just takes a little experience and the right tools.   If it’s all chiffon, or any other very gauzy loose weave, THAT can be a bitch, because it just morphs into a different shape before your eyes, but even then, a few darts or tucks or a hem should be no big deal for a tailor even on chiffon. And that’s more about how the weave behaves, not the fiber, so it also applies to polyester chiffon, cotton gauze, power mesh, etc. Plus, the garment is already cut and constructed, so it’s not going to move around much if you don’t take it apart and rebuild it.	episode_done:True
text:What do you get tailored?	labels:I havent for a while now but I used to get tops taken in at the waist and trousers hemmed. Some tops look fine loose but a lot look better more form fitting.

text:What do you get tailored?	labels:I recently got my trench tailored.

But the Docs, the Zara ones or another "inspired by", but toned down version is more likely to make it into the next years with me.

The boots might be a bit much for me- I'd love to be cool enough for Doc Marten Jadons but I can't imagine where I'd wear them. I can't even think of the last time I've been somewhere where I'd just look cool and not like I'm trying too hard.   My forte, however, is flat form sneakers. I had a pair of Sketchers Whompers that I got on clearance for $1 at a Marshalls when I was in HS. The world had moved on to those 3 inch platform flip flops by then, but I wore the absolute shit out of those Whompers.   I won a credit on Poshmark and ordered some checkerboard platform vans that I've coveted for years. Booyah.

text:Good suggestion! Thanks	labels:I'd try to avoid AliExpress (and Shein etc) for jewellery (or in general) because they shamelessly rip off designers and artisans' own original designs and then sell them at a pittance. I also avoid buying from sellers on etsy/depop/eBay who are using AliExpress charms for similar reasons. It's not always easy to know whether something has been stolen (Etsy is flooded with AliExpress-type stuff)  but ruling out places where this is the actual business model is a start. Especially if you don't want loads of pieces you may as well spend the few extra ££ supporting designers, or at least not harming them.	episode_done:True
text:Trying to get into jewelry	labels:It depends on the person, so ymmv. But when I'm trying to branch out and try different styles of jewelry, I get super cheap stuff on AliExpress. If I like the look/style of some pieces, I'll invest in higher quality pieces from there. That way if something is not for me, I don't feel bad about throwing it away.
text:Good suggestion! Thanks	labels:Also look at second hand/thrift shops/eBay. You can get some good deals without buying items you intend to get rid of later from AliExpress or similar. When you’re ready to upgrade (or if it’s not for you), just give it back to charity/thrift shop for them to sell on again.	episode_done:True

text:Trying to get into jewelry	labels:I did the same thing last year, and started with earrings as well. I just browsed Madewell because I am a big Madewell fan and have shopped there for a longtime — they have cute jewelry with most pieces falling on the lower-to-mid price range. I also looked at their ‘Labels We Love’ — which are smaller brands that have a similar aesthetic. And I ended up purchasing some stuff from the labels Tribe Alive and Year 901. So I definitely recommend starting with brands you are familiar with! Etsy is also pretty awesome, and has a large selection of jewelry. I bought a pair of medium clear lucite hoops (which are super versatile) from Leetie.

text:Trying to get into jewelry	labels:I think it really depends, one thing I noticed is that I didn't care much about quality jewelry until I was gifted an expensive ring. Before that I only bought fast fashion/forever 21 jewelry that pretty much lasted a handful of wears before it started turning my skin green and got really gross. After the expensive ring experience (maybe due to me worried i'd lose the ring so much) I started really caring about quality and it really makes a world of difference and gives each piece you receive/buy for yourself a lot of meaning.	episode_done:True

text:Inspo Album: Vintage Wool Sweaters Need Good, Loving Homes	labels:Awesome that they are still around. A testament to the durability and quality of real wool.

However I still appreciate the warmth of a real 100% cashmere or the feel of an Icelandic cardigan knitted in the natural colors . As a knitter I love to see the hard work in a wool garment and the lovely colors that you can find in the older handmade sweaters. They need some care(laundering by hand and blocking to keep their shape, air drying) store away from bugs in the off season ( mothballs!) and kept folded on a shelf or in a drawer not on hangers when in active use. You’ll also find wonderful interesting buttons on the vintage (yikes that’s my childhood years!) items. Lovely sweaters that deserve to be enjoyed by a new generation ❤️ Buying vintage? Look for stains, moth holes, odd shape from improper laundering, missing buttons. These are major faults.
text:Awesome to hear all these memories and perspective from someone who came up when these sweaters were still the primary option!  I also feel lucky that we're still in an era that all these are available as vintage.  Of course there will always be wool sweaters, but i do think vintage options will of course change over time.  I have a big wool chunky Aran sweater I mail ordered from Ireland years back.  That thing is indestructible and not a single pill or pull.  Though you make good points about the care of wool sweaters - I have made the mistake of putting other wool thru the washing machine lol.  My grandmother is a knitter and she taught me the basics, I can knit rectangles and have gone as far as knitting some simple hats.  But she has done some really complex sweaters- yes it gives a whole other perspective for what goes into making one by hand.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:I have an extensive collection of (mostly-thrifted) cashmere and wool (seriously, it's a problem and I'm trying to get rid of part of it before I move). Although I have never had moths, I'm paranoid about them. I use a vodka/filtered water/lavender/cedar/mint/other herbs essential oil spray instead of mothballs, because I hate the smell of the chemicals. (I actually just bought a secondhand vintage cashmere sweater that absolutely reeked if mothballs, and I had to wash it, soak it in vinegar, air it out outside, and spray with the vodka solution to deodorize it). Does anybody else have experience with this? I don’t actually know if the spray actually works to repel moths, but I wash all my sweaters in lavender baby shampoo before storing them, so that may also help since moths are attracted to human odors/food stains.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:I recently bought a very fine-gauge cashmere sweater that was advertised as “in excellent condition”, but when I received it, it had a tiny hole. It was only $10, so I bought a skein of close-enough wool tapestry yarn, separated the yarn into very thin, small strands, and “sewed“ the hole up with an embroidery needle. I'm planning on dyeing the entire sweater black with acid dye, to disguise the slightly-different color of the repair, but it's not very noticeable as is.   I'm not a knitter, so I don't have experience with darning or mending (other than needle-felting tiny tiny holes in already-felted wool). I've had one cashmere sweater for ages, and when it developed holes from constant wear (it wasn’t the best quality) I was able to felt them with matching wool roving.  However, if you know how to Swiss darn (duplicate stitch) you can fix really large holes, provided that you have the right color thread or yarn. If you find a sweater that you absolutely love but it has holes, you can also drop it off or mail it to a repair service to be fixed (but it is pricey).	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Yearly Aesthetic Goal Setting	labels:Great goals!  My goal for last year was to experiment with makeup, far outside my comfort zone. I normally cheat and just do "Floki eyes" when i go out dancing, but last year i did some lightning inspired crackles, a tree-like crackle (similar to the lightning so that was also kind of cheating), a circuit board motif across half my face, and a couple of different heavily Viking looks with bindrunes.  I will continue to try new things (i have one based on the lead dancer in the Suspiria remake on deck) as soon as we're allowed to go out dancing again.  Until then, my low key goal is to continue working my way through my mending box, and to take the logos off my favorite tshirts that are falling apart, and transfer them to either new tshirts or tanks, or if they are small enough to bowling style collared shirts/guyaberas.  Most of my tshirts are from charity or small business fundraisers, such as Pride or a local band, so i want to keep the memories alive even after the fabric decides to give up the ghost.	episode_done:True

The only thing I can think of is that they're either wearing the wrong style (I vastly prefer super high rise. midrise and lowrise cut me across the stomach in an uncomfortable way, unless they're a size too big), the wrong size (too small jeans WILL be terrible, especially 100% cotton), or they have sensory or digestive issues/stomach sensitivity.	labels:I have the luxury of having a live-in taylor (my mum) and consequently I wear high-rise stretchy jeans perfect for my pear/hourglass shape. In spite of that, I still find them way more uncomfortable than skirts. I dislike how they enclose my thighs and how they cut off my range of movements. I understand that sitting cross legged on the floor is not meant for jeans, but I still dislike that the fabric does not allow me to do that! At least, not as easily as leggins...	episode_done:True
text:How do comfort vs. style compare in what bottoms you wear?	labels:I mostly wear jeans/pants and I find them to be very comfortable personally. I'm honestly always a little surprised that they're so uncomfortable for most people. Most of my discomfort in skirts/dresses is mental (I just don't feel like me when I wear them).   I think if you enjoy wearing skirts you should keep wearing them, nothing wrong with that. If it's a seasonal thing maybe fleece stockings or something like that will allow you to wear them in the cooler months.

text:I have found people overwhelmingly wear clothes a size too small (like speaking to friends and whatnot). My sister, for example, buys the same size leggings as I do despite her hips and waist being 5-6 inches larger than mine, and then complains about them being see through. I have strong suspicions that this is the reason people find thongs horrifically uncomfortable as well.	labels:Once I realized that low rise jeans were more for me (bc I have a very short torso) pants became much more comfy for me!

text:What are your favorite fashionable winter jackets?	labels:I live in a part of Canada where it regularly goes down to -40 in January and February and I’ve learned that being warm>being fashionable. If I’m going to be outside for more than ten minutes, I wear a very warm and sort of ugly life coat that goes down to my knees.   Also, last year I invested in a real shearling jacket and I’ve never been so warm. I can’t wait to wear it this year!  Edit: life coat = puffer coat. I don’t know how my autocorrect did that one.	episode_done:True
text:What are your favorite fashionable winter jackets?	labels:I own the Down and Out moto jacket from BLANKNYC. It’s black with faux shearling lining. I saw Olivia Wilde wearing it and it caught my eye. It’s excellent for those freezing cold days when you still want to look sexy in your coat. I wore it in 33 degree weather in NYC. The funny thing is that I live in an arid climate now, but I probably won’t ever sell it. It’s got sentimental value. There’s several on resale sites right now.	episode_done:True

text:"freeing the titty" when you don't have "fashion boobs"?	labels:Yes free the titties! If that’s what you want to do. I hate this idea that the ideal boob shape is something that just isn’t natural for most women. Or that there is some supposed “ideal shape”. I’m currently a 38DD. Who has boobs that size that naturally look like the shape formed by an underwire bra? Literally basically no one. I’m a human person. I have boobs. They don’t have to defy gravity. And I don’t have to wear some uncomfortable CONTRAPTION to fool the world into thinking they do. I fully support women who feel their best in an underwire bra. I just don’t think we have some societal obligation to optimize our boob shapes. I like to look good and feel good in the clothes that I wear, but I’m not going to sacrifice my comfort.	episode_done:True
text:"freeing the titty" when you don't have "fashion boobs"?	labels:> Some days, I look in a mirror and I feel really sexy and carefree in the new look. Other days, I catch a glimpse of a saggy tit in a bralette peeking out of my dress and wonder if that's like...the least sexy thing in the world for a 28 year old woman?  I feel you here in many ways, except a bit of the opposite with my A cup boobs. Some days I can rock the no bra look and feel like a million bucks, and some days I look in the mirror and think "who is that little boy trying to wear grown up clothes?" I've been trying to ignore that voice and I'm having less of those days as time goes on.	episode_done:True
text:"freeing the titty" when you don't have "fashion boobs"?	labels:I'm envious. I can't free the titties, they're too heavy and it's just a weight I'm not used to.	episode_done:True
text:"freeing the titty" when you don't have "fashion boobs"?	labels:My thoughts are that everyone should wear whatever they hell they want, and nobody should feel like they *have* to wear something they don't enjoy, find uncomfortable, etc. Obviously it's not that "simple", but at the end of the day...it is. There's no magic pill you can take that will allow you to suddenly stop giving AF. It's a process of looking in the mirror, having those feelings, and then accepting that your body is the way it is and that is okay. Feeling bad about your body doesn't serve you in any way. It's not going to someday lead to you waking up with "perfect" tits if you just hate yours hard enough. All it does is make you feel bad. It's fine to have those thoughts, even the most confident and body positive people will have them. They don't need to dictate your behavior or impinge upon your happiness, though. It's a choice. It's a HARD choice, and it requires ongoing effort, but like many other things it becomes easier with practice.	episode_done:True
text:"freeing the titty" when you don't have "fashion boobs"?	labels:I too made this decision during covid. The Cara Mia bra is my favorite. Jockey makes a good Bralette too. If I don’t have time to put the pads back in after a wash I’ll use silicone nip covers underneath. Personally they give me cleavage that my underwire bras did not. They would seperate them too much. Everyone’s build is different. 38D.	episode_done:True
text:"freeing the titty" when you don't have "fashion boobs"?	labels:This post feels like it's coming from my brain! Yesterday I wore a bralette for the first time along with a low cut top and, while I was comfortable, I was also really self conscious. I ended up changing to a top with a higher neckline for a zoom hang with friends. I'm not used to my boobs being in a natural, saggy position on my body.  I have a figure that's somewhere between hourglass and pear shaped so I have always tried to dress in a way that makes my bust larger and higher in order to balance out my hips. Seeing the other posts on this thread gives me hope that it's just the need to re-train my eye.	episode_done:True
text:"freeing the titty" when you don't have "fashion boobs"?	labels:I have bigger boobs and rarely wear a bra, as I’ve gotten older they get saggier but I still make it work and the comfort and freedom out weighs my boobs looking slightly better. I feel self conscious about them sometimes but now they look weird to me when they are in a bra that really changes their shape. I say do what ever makes you comfortable, we all have different bodies, different shaped breasts and different ideals of what looks good, if you feel good about it go for it.	episode_done:True
text:"freeing the titty" when you don't have "fashion boobs"?	labels:I haven’t worn a bra in months and I love it. I’m a 38D and even if I have no problem wearing a bra, I chose not to in my everyday attire now because it’s more freeing and comfortable for me. If men can go out and not wear undershirts/go shirtless I public, I should be able to not wear a bra and not be criticized. I’ve been out and sometimes my nipples show but who tf cares? My breasts aren’t inherently sexual, they’re just a part of my lovely body and the world should realize that.	episode_done:True

text:Organizing Closet: Help!	labels:I suggest organizing and developing categories based on how you work through creating an outfit. Do you need to see items to choose them? If yes, maybe focus on hanging the items you need to see. When you go to pick out a top, how do you decided what you are looking for? Is it color, sleeve length, pattern? Do you mentally group crop tops in the same category as other shirts, or do you specifically look for crop tops? Have you designated some items as work clothes or more formal clothes vs casual? Group your clothing in the categories you put thing into in your head, even if they wouldn't make sense to others (it's your closet after all).     For example, when I'm picking out shirts think about sleeve length and pattern, and I need to see and feel the shirt to make a final decision on what to wear. For what ever reason, sorting by color isnt as big of a priority, but whether I want to wear stripes, plaid, floral, or solid is. So my shirts are hung, divided by sleeve length, then arranged by pattern (like patterns together). I also have separated out my formal clothes and my gold clothes, as those are only used at specific times and dont need to be visually cluttering my daily wardrobe.	episode_done:True
text:Organizing Closet: Help!	labels:How much hanging space do you have available? I might start by separating formal/informal, and then micro-categorize from there! And I'd loosen up the boundaries for categorizations to jackets/coats, sweaters/cardigans, dresses/jumpsuits, tops, and bottoms, just for ease. Then I'd organize each category by color.  As for storing clothes that are in-between wears...I usually just dump those on a chair and re-wear them throughout the week until they need to be washed tbh.	episode_done:True
text:Organizing Closet: Help!	labels:I divide my wardrobe into two main categories - workwear (including going-out clothes too) and home wear (including clothes I'd wear to run errands but are not nice enough to wear to work.) Those are divided again into spring/summer and fall/winter (obviously there are overlaps, I'm ok with these.)   Dresses, blouses, blazers/jackets, skirts, and dress pants go on the hangers; tees, sweaters, and jeans are folded. Socks, underwears, and scarves go in the drawers. I also have a coat stand where I hang my worn-but-not-dirty clothes. I'm not super strict with the categorization, mostly because I have limited space, but I know where everything is and it works for me.	episode_done:True
text:Organizing Closet: Help!	labels:I divide my clothes by type (as you do), function (formal/informal) and warmth. The last category helps me with weird clothes: if a crop top is lightweight I would probably wear it in summer, so for me it makes sense to group it with tanks. It helps me because if it is a warm day I can find all my choices in one place.	episode_done:True
text:Organizing Closet: Help!	labels:I have clothes divided by sections of "cold" and "warm", then within that group they're color coded (rainbow) and within each colour subgroup they're divided by lenght. I do believe some prefer it better to be sorted by lenghts over colour, but I ahve too many clothes.  The exception are (foldable) tops and jumpers, which I seasonally store away in vacuum bags, and seasonal boxes for elaborate tights. It was a forced decision because I've "ran out" of space (more like, my mother did, so she occupied my wardrobe's top shelves against my will).  I am reasonably strict, because while I'm quite an organised person, I'm also quite messy (they're not the same) and I have too many clothes. So if I facilitate in any way, my wardrobe becomes an absolute war zone. It has happened too many times.  As for dirty clothing, I usually don't wear summer tops more than once because I sweat a lot. When I do wear them more than once, I place the hangar backwards. Everything backwards and jumpeers are washed at the end of a season, then either hung back or stored away.	episode_done:True
text:Organizing Closet: Help!	labels:>	This system seems okay to me, but I don't really know how to differentiate each category based on function. For example, with the system I work with now, button-downs I wear in formal situations are currently grouped with tops I wear in informal situations AND workout-tops I wear for exercising. And this stresses me out so, so much. Then there's the issue of how effective my groupings are; like, should crop tops be with tank tops? Or maybe they're more like tees? And how do I deal with seasonal clothes?   You’re way overthinking it. You don’t have to be so strict about the categories or follow a plan to a T. Do what feels natural/right to you. If it doesn’t end up working, change it. It’s not set in stone.   1.	How do you mentally construct an outfit?  I would use those groupings because that’s what you already gravitate to. I personally sort by general type, then seasonality or formality. For example, my dresses/pants are split into formal (eg cocktail dress and up) and everything else. Within those subgroups, I sort by color.  Skirts are only sorted by color. Tops are split into sleeveless/short sleeved/long sleeved (3/4 sleeves go here), and those groups are subsorted by color.  Workout/swimwear/PJs/sweaters/underwear/socks/leggings/bras are their own categories that get dedicated drawer sections for their specific groups.  2.	Crop tops would be sorted by sleeves with other tops.  3.	worn but not dirty clothes go on a purposely dedicated row of hooks the wall (basically a fancy coat hook array that you might see in an entryway).  I’ve done this since I was a child and recommend.	episode_done:True

text:For those who define their style as "classic-traditional" (tailored, fitted, matching, sleek), what are your typical outfits for work, on the weekends, date-night, running errands or lounging around?	labels:I have a pseudo-capsule wardrobe. I technically own only a few clothing items, but in several versions. For instance, several white blouses: 4 x poplin (different fits and collars), 2 x linen, silk in a minimalist version and more  dressy one with flowing sleeves, you get the idea. I too like pencil skirts, and most of my pants are either dark jeans or straight leg or slightly tapered pants in black, navy, grey, and white, depending on the fabric and/or cut they are more or less smart/casual. I don't get too trendy so I can get longer wear without looking dated. I love scarves and if I want a pop of color I'll usually go for a colorful scarf.    Work is boring, most of the time dark jeans or dark pants and a blouse or tee and a cardigan. And flats. I need to feel comfortable or I won't get anything done. During spring and fall, when the AC isn't turning my workplace into a freezer, I get a lot of wear out of my grey wool sheath dress, 4 years and still going strong!  Going out: I switch out a cardigan for a blazer, flats to heels, and put on makeup. Grab a fancier purse than my usual work black leather tote. I have some pearl and gold inherited pieces of jewelry I might bring out for special occasions.  At home I'm a slob, sorry, I have nobody to impress. Yoga pants and tees it is, as well as  everyday clothing that shows signs of wear and is comfortable enough to lounge around.	episode_done:True

White button-downs are basically a personal staple at this point. For running errands or running around I’ll do a fitted white oxford button down with high waisted linen pants or something A-line, with a leather handbag or backpack, or a tan tote. Maybe a long coat/trench coat if it’s cold or raining. For lounging around I’ll probably wear a cardigan, sweater layered on a button down, or something else cozy.

text:For those who define their style as "classic-traditional" (tailored, fitted, matching, sleek), what are your typical outfits for work, on the weekends, date-night, running errands or lounging around?	labels:I’ve pretty much been something along the lines of modern preppy, though I am incorporating more things as I get older (I am early 40s). I wear a lot of dresses and skirts. Weekend and workdays.   My offices have been casual for around a decade now, so work wardrobe has merged with weekend.  I tend to be more dressed up than my peers.   In the old days my weekend looks were basically less structured versions of my work looks. So instead of a pencil skirt I’d wear a stretchy tube skirt that functioned like a pencil skirt with more ease. If I wore jeans, I paired it with a blouse and cardigan depending on the weather.   Now I am kinda in hiatus from pencil skirts and that shape altogether. But the same idea applies, add a casual element.    I’ll wear a work friendly skirt on the weekend with a tee shirt, probably a graphic on.  Or a more casual tank top. Today I have on straight jeans and a floral blouse. I like t-shirt dresses, and will pair them with a nicer third piece: cardigan, bomber, or maybe a blazer. I love things like a jersey jumpsuit. Or a knit one.  It has a lot of ease and drape and adds a bit of polish. My “weekend” dresses are the same shapes as the work version, but with a casual fabric. Maybe that means a cotton shirt dress instead of a more structured one.   I wear a lot of flats but have also been embracing Birkenstock’s for some outfits.    My weekend purses still have a bit of structure, because that is my preference.   And to keep my outfits kosher for my casual workplace, I always pair something dressy with something casual. And that is a good rule for weekends too.	episode_done:True
text:For those who define their style as "classic-traditional" (tailored, fitted, matching, sleek), what are your typical outfits for work, on the weekends, date-night, running errands or lounging around?	labels:I have to dress biz casual lite (aka, not jeans) for work, so my work/weekend outfits are the same - I like button-downs with midi skirts and ballet flats or feminine mule slides, high-waisted trousers with thin fitted tops, linen shorts and button-downs, and dresses (sometimes with a sweater over the top or a cardigan).   I feel like I’ve slowly narrowed in on my favored style via trial and error and I usually focus on the silhouette - I like things that nip in at the waist and I either have a looser top or bottom, but never both. I stick to a neutral palette (lots of camel, light blue, black, and green) and avoid anything too trendy.   For lounging around, I wear sweatpants haha - but I have cute high-waisted ones in a pretty tan color that are slightly “elevated.”	episode_done:True

text:What inspired your passion/love for fashion?	labels:it started as a joke... me and my equally poor friends would browse designer websites from all the major fashion houses in our common room at private school. i started reading about fashion in the library, watching biographical documentaries about designers, and slowly i began to recognise key signposts for certain designers, seasons, etc. soon enough i'd see my friends in an outfit and be able to say 'it reminds me of x designer's 2008 pre-fall collection'. i made the effort to understand the gibberish about inspirations for the season, began to make links, and yes implement a few style points in my own wardrobe on the way.  it started because i was sure it was something i'd never be able to have.	episode_done:True
text:What inspired your passion/love for fashion?	labels:Honestly, it started as a teenager because I don’t see myself as physically attractive, and so I felt like I could never pull off a simple look like jeans and a t shirt to feel pretty. My peers were developing and looked cute in anything, even gym class and I knew I was plain and uninteresting. So I thought if I had a unique sense of fashion people would pay attention to my clothes as my “appearance” rather than my looks.   Another piece was that growing up we couldn’t afford clothes for fashion (vs function) so I felt embarrassment when all my classmates had new clothes after the holidays and I was wearing the same thrifted clothes. Now that I have a solid income it’s something I am trying to cut back on, this compensating for my childhood complex lol. I have more than enough clothes (and love thrifting now) and donate regularly to charity and to friends who are interested.	episode_done:True
text:What inspired your passion/love for fashion?	labels:I love this thread! I was homeschooled by religious, conservative parents for much of my childhood. For a brief period of time, I was only allowed to wear modest dresses, and the rest of the time, I dressed like a stereotypical homeschooler, because we were poor and I wasn’t allowed to wear much.   By the time I was in middle school and earning my own money babysitting, I started to dabble in thrifting. By the end of high school, when I went to public school and eventually had a full time job shortly after graduation, I really got into it. I spent so long learning to be okay with looking different from the status quo that I eventually really learned to embrace it. I’m thirty now, and I love standing out and wearing things that other people say they could never pull off. I also have a body that the fashion industry loves, so that part was easier for me to feel like “I fit in here” (to its discredit- I fully believe it should be inclusive and celebratory of every body).   Really, it’s been a place of refuse where I can feel belonging while still embracing my “weird kid” roots.	episode_done:True
text:What inspired your passion/love for fashion?	labels:My mother. Growing up I idolized her style and would always take her saris and lipsticks. It has always been something we have bonded over. When I became 6 I think that was the time she stopped wearing the sari full time and only for special occasions. I wish she  would dress up again but she says it' would take far too long to drape the fabric.   From a young age both my parents instilled into me that a good outer appearance is very important, for ones self esteem but also for how others viewed us.	episode_done:True
text:What inspired your passion/love for fashion?	labels:At first? Growing up, like in elementary school and middle school, I really did not mesh with people. The things I liked, others did not like. The things they liked, I did not get. I didn't get the social cues others were picking up on. No one bullied me or anything extreme, but I felt very much like an outsider or an alien, trying to figure out some other species. And fashion seemed to be a predominant part of this culture I didn't understand, so I felt like if I could figure that out, I would unlock everything else. So I put a lot of work into that.  But (and not to sound so depressing!) I actually ended up really liking it, and caring more about it than others did in the end, especially when I got to college and didn't have a dress code any more. Not only could I convey that I was "normal", I could convey my interests! My personality! I could even change myself for the better in tandem with my clothes. Now I find it really fun to try to express who I am on that day, and it's been a vehicle for exploring my gender and sexuality at times as well. I like standing out now, but in a good way. Whereas before I used fashion to understand others, now I feel like I use it to help others understand me.	episode_done:True
text:What inspired your passion/love for fashion?	labels:Very similar to you, fashion was an escape for me. Teenage angst and insecurity, and a smaller town, fashion was so unlike anything in my day-to-day. And there were so many ways to escape and so many facets of the industry to jump into! It was exciting to be passionate about something that always changed. About being able to put on a flappers inspired dress on Monday and go punk on Tuesday.  Teen Vogue’s website used to post weekly snippets about fashionable teens, which is how I found most fashion bloggers in the aughts/early tens. Sea of Shoes, Rumi Neely, there was a girl in SF who was one of the first to start shredding her t-shirts (Children of something???), etc. They then led to other online communities, like The Fashion Spot, the ONTD offshoot, tumblr in its heyday. So many different people who dressed in so many different ways, but all loved what they wore and showed it!	episode_done:True
text:What inspired your passion/love for fashion?	labels:I remember trying to design dresses when I was seven years old. Then, princesses were my inspiration. After trying to ignore my interest in high school for a few years where I would still find gossip magazines to admire the red carpet looks, my dad brought me W magazine that he had found in his mailbox and looking through it at the art made me so happy. Now I am older and wear scrubs to work and have a baby, but my fashion passion is back and coming to this forum has definitely inspired me to put more love into my image day to day.	episode_done:True
text:What inspired your passion/love for fashion?	labels:I was into fashion from the age of 11 — back then it was mostly just looking at magazines and doodling my own designs in the margins of my notebooks at school.  For me a big thing is definitely being able to highlight the things about myself I like, and — as cliche as it sounds — to express myself. I was never confident before I started dressing the way i LIKED (not the way everyone else did).  I’m a very short and petite girl and in my teens I struggled with not feeling feminine. Fashion was kind of an outlet, like roleplay! The first time I wore heels to school was transformational. I also enjoyed putting together outfits that are more ”masculine”, and juxtaposing feminine with masculine. I get kicks from matching little details, like lipstick and a purse. Fashion is just something that seems really trivial in the grand scheme of things but that actually has a bigger impact than we realize!	episode_done:True
text:What inspired your passion/love for fashion?	labels:As far as creating outfits for myself---I think it had to do being uncomfortable with my weight and skin (I had normal acne, but I scar really easily, so I have "shadows" of where pimples used to be years later...) and just never really feeling "pretty." So I'd try to put together outfits that maybe were interesting or looked polished, because I knew (or at least firmly believed) that **I** was/am not interesting and polished. I "knew" that no one would ever compliment or be attracted to me, so maybe I could trick them into noticing my outfit at least...I don't know. I think in a lot of ways I've come pretty far in this area, but I definitely still use clothes as a kind of armor almost. Like, don't repeat outfits and don't wear what other people have and don't do the expected combinations and all of that are hard habits to break, especially since I *do* get complimented/validated regarding clothing and not so much about my body, so I get caught in the mind trap of it all. It's gross and I'm still struggling a lot of days...  As far as fashion in general--I think watching Project Runway! It spurred me to find other fashion shows and documentaries and things of that nature. I love the creative minds behind the shows. I'm less interested in the final product, but just hearing how people, especially on a show like Project Runway, are inspired and (pardon the reference) make it work with so many limitations the show throws at them...it's so fascinating. I'm equally enthralled by cooking shows, where they have such knowledge and talent to do the seemingly impossible.	episode_done:True
text:What inspired your passion/love for fashion?	labels:For me, it was the opposite... so I am still young but I grew up staring at magazines and with no one that had the same body type as me- what is now called ‘medium’. Where companies have a bunch of skinny girls and will through in few plus size girls just to get some diversity... but yet, still don’t see any medium sized girls... Nonetheless, many desi girls (desi refers to south asian).   In middle school, wasn’t a fan of makeup but my best friend was. Since as long as I could remember, she would tell me about everything she was doing and how much she loved to do her makeup. One day in 8th grade, I was staring myself in the mirror and was like hm, I want to start trying to use makeup. And from there it started... From then until about the next 4 years, I taught myself and watched video after video after video. This is what fueled me into fashion. Around my Junior year in High School, the confidence makeup gave me transferred into just wanting to look my best. I became obsessed in streetwear and just looking really cool...   From then on my style has changed a bit, but overall it was my friends and what they were into that inspired my first looks. I would take those and find things similar that seemed more like me :)	episode_done:True
text:Does anyone have any visual guides for how clothes should fit	labels:I really appreciate this question/thread. I didn’t grow up seeing anyone in my family or circles wearing well-tailored clothing or professional attire in general so i genuinely don’t know what a good fit looks like. I struggle a lot with having a curvier body and a loud personality but not wanting to feel like a pinup girl caricature if my clothes are too tight or fit a certain way. I’ve never really thought about what i would and wouldn’t consider a good fit on me, besides my Levi’s 721s. I really need to have myself a think on this!	episode_done:True

text:Adapting to age/workplace appropriate attire while staying true to yourself [discussion]	labels:I don’t think complying with a dress code (or wearing a uniform) at work is not being “true to yourself.” It’s paying your bills.

text:Adapting to age/workplace appropriate attire while staying true to yourself [discussion]	labels:What is it about your personality that you feel is lost in workwear?   Also...oftentimes when I talk to people having this struggle, their understanding of work wear styles is very narrow. Workwear isn't just Ann Taylor. There are tons of ways to go beyond a button-down shirt and a pencil skirt. Interesting fabrics, for example, or subtle accessories that are more reflective of your personality.
text:This exactly. I have a pretty stuffy office job with a fairly traditional business dress code (not business formal, but the kind of business casual where jeans are 100% not okay, people wear pantyhose with skirts, blazers are extremely popular, absolutely no thighs or cleavage or shoulders seen), but I still have no trouble finding work-appropriate clothing that makes me feel comfortable and that I like to wear.   I have pretty loud taste and I am not one for neutrals, while also being pretty conservative with regard to the amount of skin I like to show, and I love to find stuff with bold colours (like my very favourite suit, which is bright magenta), strong shapes (like oversized boyfriend blazers instead of a traditional hip-length fitted ones, wide paperbag pants, cape sleeves, etc), and unusual patterns, like a cardigan I have with small intarsia unicorn silhouettes. I only buy the shapes I like, so no pencil skirts, high necklines only, pant rises similar to those in my casual wardrobe, etc.   I absolutely live in athleisure outside the office, but I still like and enjoy my work wardrobe a lot and I think it's still expressive while being appropriate for my specific office. I pretty much only wear it to work and I don't pull any of it out to go to the grocery store, but it's still great for the purpose and I don't need to be able to wear all my clothes for every occasion.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Adapting to age/workplace appropriate attire while staying true to yourself [discussion]	labels:What kinds of styles do you gravitate towards that you don’t feel are appropriate?  And I’ve found that I just sort of develop 2 wardrobes, my work wardrobe and my casual one. Some pieces are interchangeable, some aren’t. But I still find a way to blend my personality into my work wear. It’s just a different part of my persona that’s represented.
text:My work dress code says "black and fashionable", and my natural state is color color color. I'm very eclectic in my preferred styles though: like ethereal/fairy-esque (which it all depends on the color), military chic (which i can sometimes get away with), Gothic/steampunk inspired... theatrical is probably the best way I can describe it.  I guess I've kind of done the same thing, but I think there's just a bit more pressure right now to look the part of the adult vs my natural state of being.	labels:I’d look at the items you have in a bright color and look for something similar in black.	episode_done:True
text:Adapting to age/workplace appropriate attire while staying true to yourself [discussion]	labels:Whenever people have to work with an all-black or neutral look for work, I always tell them to look for patterns and textures instead of color to make the outfits more fun. If your style is more gothic/steampunk inspired then maybe look for items that feature velvet, zippers, or black damask print. Or if you’re feeling more ethereal you could try some lace or satin.  You might also be able to get away with fun accessories as long as they’re not distracting.	episode_done:True
text:Adapting to age/workplace appropriate attire while staying true to yourself [discussion]	labels:I came to the following conclusion a few years ago:  >I am able to wear essentially anything I want anywhere I want.  However, **every single person I meet with functioning eyes** (whether they are aware of it or not) will pass judgment on my appearance no matter what I wear, and some of these people are in a position to materially affect my life based on their opinion of me.  I think it's unrealistic for most people to "wear what you want, screw the haters!" because appearance-based judgments happen constantly.  Is that a problem?  Heck yes.  Is it illegal?  When it comes to clothing, usually not.  The balance between "what I like" and "what won't get me ostracized and unemployed" is going to be very personal and will probably change several times in your life.  The trick is figuring out who you can't afford to *not* please (being realistic, of course), then figure out what is needed to please them, then figuring out where your creative freedom lies.   Most people have substantially more creative freedom in their off-work hours.	episode_done:True

text:Adapting to age/workplace appropriate attire while staying true to yourself [discussion]	labels:I still buy from the junior's section and I'm 31. A) I'm only 5'2" and B) it's sometimes cheaper. I just try to make sure that I don't wear something to work that my students would wear. Beyond that, the sky's the limit. I'm known for dressing up anyway.  Look for sturdier materials rather than "slub" ones, and pay close attention to fit. I look better in form-fitting clothes or items with a defined waist, and avoid the long and loose T-shirt dresses. If material and fit are good, I find that nobody can really tell that it's a dress designed for twelve year-olds.	episode_done:True

text:Adapting to age/workplace appropriate attire while staying true to yourself [discussion]	labels:There is nothing wrong with having 2 or more sets of clothes (work and not-work). I have to wear outdoor clothing for my "big girl job" - think wellies and raincoat or full on hiking gear - and a lot of jobs require a uniform. I also play a sport so i have kit for that. And I have a set of smarter clothes for the odd time I need them (weddings, funerals and interviews!) It's not unsustainable. You dont have to go minimalist or what you think is sophisticated if you don't want to.   As for age appropriate? When I was mid 20's I gave up (most) things that are for children and looked it because I felt I looked silly in them (I'm early 30s) but that was about it for age appropriateness. Other stuff I stopped wearing because my body and/or style changed rather than just ageing. Even the kiddie stuff, i dont think its necessarily silly/ageing on everyone. Some people really go all out on it and OTT and make it a look, and good for them. I did have a sudden panic late 20s that I needed to dress more adult, and wasted some money on things I never wore. But most of the pressure was coming from me and from magazine features. My friends, colleagues and partner DGAF.	episode_done:True

text:Throwback Thursday: Revisiting "How to Determine Your Body Type" and "On Dressing Your Body Type"	labels:So, I'll start. I definitely fell into the trap of both not really understanding my own body and trying to look like a tall slim hourglass all the time (which is not my body.)   Taking the time to really understand silhouettes and how to adjust them for my body was a huge breakthrough for me, as well as readjusting my thought process toward "what do I want to emphasize?" vs "Is this flattering?"   Being more thoughtful and critical about the difference between something looking good and something emphasizing the "tall slim hourglass" was also really helpful. So much of fashion that we feel is objective is actually about our eye and what we train our eye to perceive as good. Getting away from that, and training my eye to see the tall slim hourglass as one silhouette among many, really helped me wear things "I couldn't pull off."	episode_done:True
text:Throwback Thursday: Revisiting "How to Determine Your Body Type" and "On Dressing Your Body Type"	labels:There is a ton of great info in these, though I think what I found most interesting was the section in Body Type about other measurements and proportions, because it offered a clearer explanation of why you might measure as one type and not look it.  Both guides still felt outdated, not only because of the fashion examples, but because the popular silhouette has shifted more in favor of a dramatic hourglass/pear and there more leeway in what’s considered flattering in general.  There already seems to be a lot of (understandable) dislike towards typing systems, so I could see it being beneficial to **start off** with reframing, i.e. “having an understanding of your body shape/silhouette allows you to present it in the way that you feel is most flattering”, and then moving into an explanation of the types (instead of getting right into it/breaking down all the problems before trying to convince you it’s still useful,) the shapes/silhouettes, and how to attain them. Personally, I’d love it if you could go “my body is shaped more like this type, doing xyz would help me look more like that type.” and a mention of each type being more easily read as masculine/feminine/androgynous, though it’d have to be handled delicately;  I just think it’d be helpful for people trying to present themselves more in those ways.	episode_done:True

text:Accessories newbie and am not sure where to start...what are your must-have starter pieces?	labels:I think it would be good to start with some gold and silver necklaces that you can layer like basic chains with charms and some some hoop earrings, pearls, or diamond studs. You can even get some colorful jewelry for statement pieces or a pop or color. And I would say get a black belt and a brown belt cause they can go with anything almost.

text:Great ideas, thank you! I just realized...I don't own any belts! Haha so that's on my list now too.	labels:If you're into thrifting, belts are a great piece to buy second hand! So many cool statement belts, and almost always tons of classic leather staples belts too.	episode_done:True
text:Accessories newbie and am not sure where to start...what are your must-have starter pieces?	labels:I don’t have suggestions on specific pieces, but I love using Etsy to find new pieces when I need them.   Additionally, you should learn what type of material works best for you. Some people are sensitive to the cheaper metals (usually nickel which can turn skin green or cause infections). Sterling silver is a good bet and usually won’t cost a fortune (as opposed to gold).	episode_done:True
text:Accessories newbie and am not sure where to start...what are your must-have starter pieces?	labels:Thrift / consignment stores are fantastic for jewelry shopping! Thrift stores usually have cheaper stuff like you’d find at F21 or H&M, but consignment stores have authentic pieces for fairly reasonable prices. If you’re really feeling the fancy stuff, I bought my high school graduation ring (white gold, green sapphire and diamond) at an antique store for about 100$ USD.	episode_done:True
text:Accessories newbie and am not sure where to start...what are your must-have starter pieces?	labels:My most essential accessories:  * work purse * weekend purse * going out purse * day to day versatile earrings * day to day statement earrings * fancy event statement earrings * going out statement earrings * short day to day necklace * pendant necklace * statement necklace * day to day ring (hand washing friendly) * cocktail ring (a big one that is fun for parties) * Bracelets - these are hard for me day to day, they get in the way of typing. I think they are better served for weekends and parties. I have a full range, but I go in waves on wearing them often. If you are more jewelry maximal, having a said of wear every day bracelets and fancy occasion ones is the right wardrobe. But the shapes you should choose vary based on wrist size and preferences. I like cuffs over bangles. And I do not like tennis bracelets, I am not a delicate jewelry person.  Sources?   * local craft events * Coach - bags, occasionally costume jewelry * Kate Spade - I like their whimsical costume jewelry, the bags are OK * I have some fave jewelry stores nearby: Crown Nine, Phillipa Roberts, Esquleto, Cielomar. I tend to like geometric shapes, and not colorful jewelry because I am really colorful in my wardrobe.  I generally don't love shopping on Etsy, it is hard to find the gold amongst all the stuff, I don't like the hunt, I like curated sources. Some things are well made and some things I could have made myself with no training. It is hard to discern based on a shop listing.	episode_done:True
text:Accessories newbie and am not sure where to start...what are your must-have starter pieces?	labels:I love Etsy for jewelry! There’s a huge range of eclectic handmade statement pieces to classic but affordable silver and gold/gold filled pieces. Also, since we are heading towards colder weather in the northern hemisphere, scarves and tights really help adding versatility to your wardrobe. Tights especially help with transitioning warmer weather clothes like skirts and dresses into fall.	episode_done:True
text:Accessories newbie and am not sure where to start...what are your must-have starter pieces?	labels:I often use:  Short necklaces in gold and silver Long necklaces in gold and silver Watches that match gold and silver Chain bracelets that match gold and silver (but might be string or leather) Diamond (CZ because I lose them so often) stud earrings Pearl stud earrings Gold and silver ball earrings  Gold and silver hoops I only really wear my white gold wedding rings or silicone ones, but I like minimalist gold and silver rings too I wear a camel? Cognac? Colored leather crossbody purse with everything. It’s light enough that I don’t think it looks super weird with black outfits. I do have a black leather tote for things like interviews though.  I have a couple plaid blanket scarves for when it’s really cold out.  Also, I’m not sure if it counts as an accessory, but I love a quilted vest. I live in the south and most of the fall is too hot for a real coat, so I wear a lot of knit long sleeve tees and sweaters with a vest on top. Juuuuust warm enough, makes me feel more put together because of the layers, and has giant pockets.	episode_done:True
text:Accessories newbie and am not sure where to start...what are your must-have starter pieces?	labels:Scarves are my go to. Both because I’m a cold person, and because they are so easy to mix and match and change things up.   I’d recommend getting some that are 100% silk, they are so comfortable and easy to wear. You can pick them up fairy cheaply on eBay and similar places. Have a play around with how to tie them (Pinterest is a great resource!) and have fun 😊	episode_done:True
text:Accessories newbie and am not sure where to start...what are your must-have starter pieces?	labels:Accessories are just as subject to cycles in fashion as anything else, but I always save mine even when I throw out tops and pants. Partly that is because my body won’t outgrow a necklace.   For some reason every woman around me was wearing stars the last two years, and I never saw it outside of this town. But because I had kept some old star earrings I had stopped wearing, I was already set to be on-trend. I think super thin necklaces are on the way out. But if you already have one you really like and don’t mind putting it away for several years, chances are it will be fashionable again.  And since you’re going for adult fashion, don’t forget black leather (or glittery plastic) business card cases. Even if your field doesn’t use business cards, you can put credit cards in them. I like the Francesca’s chain for those.	episode_done:True

I'm *so* tempted to buy a Ted Baker coat or dress as my first expensive single item, but they're especially unnecessary due to the pandemic.

text:What was your first 'expensive' fashion purchase?	labels:It was 2009, I was on a business trip to a place that had the first Tiffany store I'd ever seen. I'd just gotten my tax refund and I was positively salivating over an oval tag Return to Tiffany necklace.   I was 25. I rented my very first rental car, printed out my map quest directions, and set off in the direction of the mall.   Entering the store, I had the distinct feeling that I didn't belong there. Everything is so SHINY. Fuck it, I took my time and drank it in. A very coiffed woman asked me if there was anything she could help with. I made my move. I ordered up my dream luxury necklace. She was polite, but skeptical.  It was laid out on a display board, so close to being mine- its little Tiffany blue bag set neatly beside it.   Wrap it up- I'll take it! I'll be passing on my cheap knock off oval tag, it's the real thing, baby!  $330. I'd never spent that kind of money on anything. My rent was $400, FFS.   Guess who forgot to tell the bank I'd be traveling? This girl. STRAIGHT UP DENIED.   The looks of "knew it" as I left the store penetrated my soul. I've had walk of shames that were way less shameful.  I called the bank and eventually got it sorted and went back for my necklace.   I haven't worn it in probably 8 years at the least. Don't even know if they still make them.	episode_done:True

text:I find it helpful to go out and really look at everyone else. I realize that I a) don't look that closely at people usually b) I don't care what they're wearing, also most people aren't perfectly styled but look fine. When I go out in my new outfit, I really pay attention to everyone else but usually no one even glances. Honestly, no one cares.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:People who used to play super safe with fashion, how did you overcome your fear of bold choices?	labels:I wear it at home. So I can get used to it without others seeing me. After a bit I suddenly feel more comfortable.   Also, avoid mirrors! This helped massively when I was trying to get comfortable wearing bright lipsticks.
text:I super agree with wear it at home, especially with the pandemic. Since March I've been wearing those more out there blouses and outfits that I bought but have been usually too nervous to wear. I work from home rn so waking up and picking out an outfit has been a fun way to keep some sort of routine. I feel good wearing them when I (sadly rarely) go  my partner to get groceries and the like. Now the final step I think is wearing it out one day when I meet up with friends and folks I know again.   For whatever reason I just dread the comments of "oh wow that's new" or "dang all dressed up" but in reality it's not a big deal. People won't have seen me irl in basically a year so what better time to say I changed things up	labels:About the comments from others, this was one that I struggled with for a long time. I think it’s important to think about any and all other reasons that may have led to them making those comments. Honestly, I think it’s more likely that most people say that kind of stuff because they’re searching for a way to start a conversation and that’s all they could quickly come up with it. Not necessarily that they wanted to point out or judge your choice in clothing. It’s also relieving over time to push away the feeling that you’re obligated to explain yourself. If that’s not the conversation you want to have, simply say yep or thanks and move the conversation along :)	episode_done:True
text:People who used to play super safe with fashion, how did you overcome your fear of bold choices?	labels:After I traveled to a place where people constantly stared at me no matter what I wore, I kind of got over it. Getting older has also helped me to feel less self-conscious. Bright colors and interesting details make me happy, and I think people can tell when I feel comfortable with what I wear.   Even if it looks off, who's going to remember? Do you remember what you thought about some random stranger from 2 weeks ago? Probably not.	episode_done:True
text:Teach me how to successfully shop secondhand please!! Or just commiserate if it’s hard for you too lol.	labels:A few tips that work for me in thrift stores: - I pick one section and don't feel like i have to check out the entire store.  - I go through racks and touch everything and stop when I touch something that feels like a nice fabric - silk, cashmere, good wool, crisp cotton. This helps me get to the nice stuff when the racks are visually overwhelming. - try on lots of things! Sometimes you fall in love with stuff you didn't expect to.   On websites that are searchable: - have a very specific item in mind or a specific brand you like - narrow the search results by size, brand, color, and fabric - pay attention to the measurements to see if things will fit - don't be afraid to make low offers on sites where you can do that  I find online thrifting very different than in-store thrifting, because online, you can search for all kinds of specific things, where in a store, most of the fun comes from finding something unexpected.
text:> I go through racks and touch everything and stop when I touch something that feels like a nice fabric - silk, cashmere, good wool, crisp cotton.  If anyone is curious, this is a trainable skill. Go to a thrift store. Just go down a rack and touch every garment in the rack. Make a guess in your mind about what fabric it is, and then check the actual material label. If you do this over and over again, your guesses will become more accurate until you can accurately predict what the material labels will say. It's a skill that can be systematically practiced.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Second on feeling fabrics quickly. If I feel a fabric that seems decent I’ll go look at the tags, what materials its comprised of, and what country it was made in. I don’t discriminate necessarily by country, but if it’s a fabric I’m not entirely sold on and it says “Made in China”, I’ll pass. If it’s a great fabric and it says “Made in China”, I’m fine with it.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Teach me how to successfully shop secondhand please!! Or just commiserate if it’s hard for you too lol.	labels:I do pretty well at smaller, “high-end” consignment stores and I **love** getting a good deal.  * Pay attention to fabrics. A lot of brands make nice clothes in cheap fabrics. To me, this defeats the purpose of buying from “fancy” brands.  * Have an idea of what you want before you go shopping, but be open to other options. I love coats and have gotten two great coats on consignment when I was really there to check out the shoes. It’s also a good idea to shop for items that are out of season but that aren’t so trendy that you won’t feel like wearing them when the right season rolls around. Now would be a great time to shop for boots, for example (assuming you’re in the northern hemisphere).  * If you’re comfortable shopping in person during these crazy times, try stuff on! Even if the fit isn’t perfect, trying stuff on can help you see which areas may need to be tailored. If you’re getting a garment that retails for $700 on consignment for less than $100, spending a bit of money on tailoring is still a bargain.  * Be patient! I got a very cute pair of heeled loafers by Bally after searching for a proper pair of heeled loafers for MONTHS. Persistence is key!	episode_done:True
text:Teach me how to successfully shop secondhand please!! Or just commiserate if it’s hard for you too lol.	labels:I buy almost everything from thrift shops. I keep a list of items I'm looking to buy (black turtleneck, navy sweater vest, etc), on my phone. Whenever I'm near a thrift shop, I stop in to check for those items only.   I have a lot of success this way and I spend very little time shopping.	episode_done:True
text:Teach me how to successfully shop secondhand please!! Or just commiserate if it’s hard for you too lol.	labels:I'm very successful at online secondhand shopping since I search by my measurements on websites like eBay and etsy - like "x bust y waist" and then narrow it down by dress, sweater, fabric era, etc. I've found some lovely treasures that way!	episode_done:True
text:Teach me how to successfully shop secondhand please!! Or just commiserate if it’s hard for you too lol.	labels:Most of my secondhand finds are from online auctions or poshmark-type sites. I’d say about half my wardrobe is from these places (more like 80% for shoes).  - Have a pattern. Search for the same items/brands/keywords over time and get a good idea of what’s available and what a fair price is.   - Buy fabrics, brands and cuts you already know and like. I’ve made some big mistakes with things like second hand cashmere because I don’t normally wear it and I didn’t know what to look for.   - Be picky. There’s so much choice that it becomes overwhelming, so you’ve got to have a firm idea of what your dislikes are. No matter how cute the garment is, I won’t buy certain things... for example, visible distressing, suede footwear and polka dot are all off the table because I just won’t wear them.   You’ve got to be willing to take the hits with the misses when you’re doing this online - I’d say my success rate is around 50/50 for things that make it into my regular wardrobe rotation. I do my best to resell my fails, and I’d say I probably break even on average, but it’s a lot of effort and not for the faint hearted. But I love doing it so it’s more like a hobby than a chore - but it’s not for everyone, and there’s no shame in that!	episode_done:True
text:Teach me how to successfully shop secondhand please!! Or just commiserate if it’s hard for you too lol.	labels:I buy a lot of my stuff on Depop or Etsy. I've found that the easiest way to do it is know what you want and have a lot of strict rules for yourself. If you're just looking to browse and buy whatever catches your eye like you would in a store, it's gonna be harder. So recently I've been buying a lot of jumpers. These are my rules:  * no fast fashion brands * under £20 * must be "buy it now" because I can't be bothered with auctions * must be at least 50% wool * must show a photo of the label stating the materials used * body of the jumper must be at least the same length as the sleeves because I don't want a cropped jumper * must have a picture of the front and back of the jumper * Nothing that has a brand name or logo outwardly visible  so my search terms are things like "wool jumper size S" "vintage wool jumper" "Ralph Lauren wool jumper" etc. which narrows it down massively from just searching "jumper".  Then I filter by "used" and "buy it now" (on Ebay)  Sometimes I then sort by Price - Low to High, sometimes I don't bother.   Then because of my rules, I know quickly wether something meets my criteria, so I'll open like 20 tabs that meet the criteria without looking closely at them.   When I've got about 20 open, I'll actually go through them and decide if I like / want any of them.	episode_done:True
text:Teach me how to successfully shop secondhand please!! Or just commiserate if it’s hard for you too lol.	labels:Honestly thrifting is really more about the love of the hunt than finding a wardrobe full of new (to you) clothes. It’s not like regular shopping where you go, spend 20 minutes looking, and leave with 5 pieces you really love. Last time I went thrifting I spent probably about 2 hours looking, tried on 7 things, and ended up only buying one. If taking the time to dig through piles of trash to find the one treasure is t really your jam, thrifting probably isn’t really for you.	episode_done:True

text:Do you follow the conventional rules around "flattering your figure?"	labels:I've written about this before, but as someone who is 5'2 on a good day, I have stopped giving a shit about looking "longer and leaner."  In fact, I reject the idea that I should want to look taller. Maybe all those 5'7 women should be taking advice on how to make their legs look as stubby as mine. <--Obviously a joke but to make a point. How stupid is it that I should feel like my natural body is something to correct?  I'm an old woman, lol, and over the course of my life I have never found that my stubby legs (that I was once self-conscious about) have kept me from career advancement or from finding people who thought I was beautiful and wanted to have sex with me, so what's the freaking problem?  Fuck conventional figure flattery.  That being said, of course there are things I think look better on me than other things and I tend to wear the things I think look better in ways I think look better most of the time.

text:Best comment here.  But really, I can just head my mom telling me that my outfit is “figure flattering” as the greatest compliment...  I used to abide by that idea 100 percent when I had no confidence and felt I needed to try to look as skinny as possible - because that’s what figure flattering means. F that. I still pick out clothes I like on my body, but don’t worry about it as much if it doesn’t elongate my legs but it’s a kickass piece!	labels:	episode_done:True

I've been, at various times, self conscious about it & listened to the seemingly universally accepted notion that it is desirable to look taller.  Now, the idea that taller is objectively better is a crap idea I bought into mindlessly.  I'm embracing my height and rebelling against choosing my clothes with the aim of looking taller.

text:Do you follow the conventional rules around "flattering your figure?"	labels:I guess I don't really follow them because as a pear shape the advice is usually to emphasize the other body parts to draw attention away from the hips. But I like my butt, so I don't feel like I need to specifically hide it.  Also I think bootcut or flare jeans that are usually recommended just make my legs look like columns, and slimmer pants actually show that  I have slim legs and ankles (which to me looks nicer). I think a lot of this advice was based on the idea that the goal is to look as skinny as possible, so if anything is sticking out it needs to be obscured. My mom said she never wore jeans in the 80s/90s because she thought her butt was too big for them, and it's not even a particularly huge butt. So at the time the hourglass ideal was just overshadowed by the need to not look "fat" it any way (especially in the 90s).

text:Psychological & personal reasons for impulse buying	labels:I was definitely in my feelings after the Gen Z vs Millennial fashion thread, and after months where I've only bought a few items on poshmark, I ended up placing two orders trying to prove to myself that im not an old millennial that doesn't know how to dress. and then i bought some new athletic gear because I had already warmed up my credit card so, fuck it budget to the wind.	episode_done:True

text:Psychological & personal reasons for impulse buying	labels:Impulse buying is hella of a drug, I feel the urge to buy anything clothes related at least once a week. Specially right now that I’m expecting I find the “joy” that gives me buying things for myself is not the same as buying for the nursery,  because I don’t feel the last one rewards me.

text:Psychological & personal reasons for impulse buying	labels:Yeah, I shop a lot because I'm usually sad and it feels like new items will fix that somehow, or make people miraculously like me more. I'm aware that it doesn't work like that, but I love dressing up as a "new me" every day and I easily get bored... but that's just mental issues :/  With autism and me identifying as queer and all, I'm not exactly popular and there isn't one version of me I'd consider the real me, which makes it even more difficult. "The real me" fluctuates day by day, and so do my outfit preferences. I often buy things impulsively that I WILL love for quite some time, but never on two subsequent days, for example. I've been mocked for this, but I've still found I'm happiest like this, with my crazy big wardrobe and tons of different styles.

text:I can absolutely understand this. I am an aspie and I buy things because they look beautiful, often not even using it, just because I have the inner urge to take it with me because it is beautiful and I also think others maybe think it's beautiful and so they maybe like and accept me more. My wardrobe is crazy as well, like elegant, boho, goth, japanese fashion, girly stuff lol But it's so destructive to buy so much stuff. I found out I'm trying to fill the void in my soul with it and am only impulse buying when I either found a new special interest (at least a bit understandable) or when feeling lonely, depressive and not motivated for any hobbies. I decided to go to therapy now to better myself and the financial situation.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Yep. This. I recently realized that my spending problem was extremely similar to the way Binge Eating works , and have been trying to do things in moderation (financial version of intuitive eating ) and it’s been working ! It’s frustrating though because a lot of people , my friends specifically, don’t realize how much of a problem it is , and mock me for not just “stop spending and use all your money to pay your debt” , the spending in moderation has been helping me pay off debt without accumulating more !	labels:This is super interesting to me because I’m in a unique financial situation. My husband and I paid off all debt except mortgage when we were 22 and 25. It was the crazy Dave Ramsey intense debt reduction on very small salaries (nonprofit work and jr enlisted military), but we paid off $35k in 20 months...and then we had to move and I lost my job. Things went from VERY tight (due to our priorities) to a little looser, but still no real money. Don’t think I bought new clothes except for running shoes, and a few bras in 2+ years. Now, fast forward another year+, I ended up going back to school and we are still living on one salary. Husband has been promoted so our budget is looser...and I have a hard time controlling my miscellaneous budget because I went through like a spending drought for SO long that every time I see a good deal on something, I’m like “Oh I should get that because idk when we might need it and not be able to afford it,” especially basics like jeans, bras, etc.  I’m worried for when I graduate in a few months and our income like quadruples. Ain’t no telling where that money is going to end up.
text:I can’t speak from experience with this, but according to a few people I know the book *I Will Teach You to Be Rich* by Ramit Sethi is really great if you have “enough” money but still have massive anxiety about how to spend it. I used to read this guy’s blog a million years ago and it was pretty different than most finance stuff—he was more about figuring out how to responsibly use money  in ways that made you happy, rather than, like, strict budgets and the evils of cc debt.   Also, congrats about the nurse thing! That’s amazing!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Psychological & personal reasons for impulse buying	labels:Personally, I would say it all boils down to feeling like I need a 'treat' when I'm having a tough time. I grew up with a single mum and money was kind of tight, so although she did the best she could, I didn't have a games console or label clothes or the latest trendy toys, and I only ever got anything at christmas or on my birthday. I learnt from very early on not to pester my mum for something in the shop, because the answer was always no.  When I got older and had my own money, I loved to save it. I didn't really get to go anywhere, and so if I did have the occasional day out with friends, I'd make the most of it and spend the money I had been saving up. I guess along the way it became like a special treat that made me feel like I had a chance at 'fitting in' with my friends and finding myself, because I got the chance to buy things that weren't picked out by an adult as a gift or second- third- fourth- hand from the car boot or charity shop.  Nowadays, impulse buys give me a surge of happiness that I can be who I want and buy what I want, and it just makes me feel better when I'm struggling.

text:Psychological & personal reasons for impulse buying	labels:I had a job where I was miserable and I shopped online like a hungry wolf. Basically the only thing that made me going to work bearable was the possibility of getting a package. I am in a much better place now and while I still buy stuff online, usually EBay, it’s much more reasonable and thoughtful (only stuff I need & I resell/donate what I don’t). When I was in the Bad Job, I had no doubt shopping that maniacally was not normal but I just couldn’t see another way. (Til I quit!)
text:At a horrible toxic job, getting packages was the only piece of happiness I got every day. Didn't matter if it was coffee filters from Amazon, just the fact that something good would happen to me at work was enough to help me make it through the day.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Future of fibers?	labels:I think the future of fashion will be that natural fibers will get increasingly rare in the mainstream, but I hope that etsy sellers/minimalism fashion/indie brands that are the source of a lot of my 100% natural products evolve in the future to be more stylish and less “handmade.” I was a teen in the 90s with a mom who was obsessed with 100% cotton and I remember going shopping with her and maybe 30% of the items were that. Last year I went into a Club Monaco looking for either an 100% cotton or linen top and was told that they didn’t have any of that in the store. And Club Monaco isn’t cheap.  >Are there are any brand's or companies that have been successful in using natural fibers and also have quality products?  My list for cotton and linen (because I turned out to be my mom):  - Eileen Fisher  - Jungmaven (hemp)  - Lilla P   - Sunspel  - Demylee  - Tela 9  - The Great  - Amomento  - Filosophia  - Frank and Eileen  - Le Bon Shoppe (my opaque white shirt haven)  - Muji  - Nicholas  - Norse Projects  - SEA NY  That minimalist look:  - Esby Apparel   - Hackwith Design House  - Wol Hide  - Not Perfect Linen (etsy)  - Epic Linen (etsy)  - Linen Sea (etsy)  Affordable:  - Hanes, especially the ultraweight cotton tees  - Uniqlo  - Lands End  You can also find some 100% natural stuff starting at accessible luxury and midlevel designer brands like Tory Burch, Vince, Theory, Ulla Johnson, Comme des Garcons, Frame, APC, L’Agence, ATM etc. as well as mens/outdoors stores like LL Bean. but I listed only the brands that carry mostly 100% or for affordable brands, at least offer a decent selection consistently. All carry cotton and linen of the quality that I remember in my youth as opposed to the paper thin stuff except maybe Uniqlo which is similar in quality to... say Madewell but cheaper/different style
text:Hello. Thank you so much for sharing this.  I grew up in Mumbai. And I never knew what was handloom fabrics till 2 years ago.  Ever since I have access to handloom/handmade fabric, I always prefer that. What companies label as 100% cotton/linen does have chemicals and a slight synthetic feel compared to the handloom fabrics. But I have come across certain machine made fabrics which are so comfortable that I'd want to wear it even if they are old or torn. They just get better with time.  I'm exploring if and how to take natural handloom clothes to masses. In a sustainable way. Economically and environmentally.  Thank you so much for sharing the brand's with me 🙏	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Future of fibers?	labels:Personally I don’t find it very difficult or expensive to shop for clothing made with natural fibers — if anything it’s gotten even easier to do so with online shopping and websites showing fiber content right in the product description. I don’t have to seek out brands that specialize in natural materials either — my clothing is mostly from Madewell, which doesn’t really market itself as being all that environmentally conscious or sustainable, and is definitely not a high end brand, but they have tons of options for clothing made of cotton, silk, etc.   I will say it’s gotten harder to find sweaters made of 100% wool over the years, however. I have several wool sweaters from mall brands that I bought just a few years ago. I gained some weight since then and have been looking for replacements from the same exact brands and it seems like they don’t even bother with 100% wool anymore, all of their sweaters are now made with acrylic, nylon, polyester, etc. That’s the only natural fiber that I feel has all but disappeared from the mainstream for some reason.   I will also add that I don’t think man made fibers are necessarily “cheap”, either. We’ve come a long way from man made materials of the 80s and 90s. When I think of man made fibers of today, I think of technical clothing and gear such as outdoor or sportswear. Patagonia for example is the poster child for environmentally friendly brands, but most of their clothing is made from man made materials, and their products are far from cheap. Partly because it performs better for its purpose, and partly because it’s supposed last a lifetime.  Which leads me to my last thought — IMO man made materials aren’t necessarily bad for the environment. It’s really our habits that are bad, and the industries that cater to these habits. If we all bought a few items of clothing that were all man made and lasted our lifetime, that is arguably *more* environmentally friendly than if we were constantly buying and throwing away natural fibered clothing.
text:While natural fibers are hard on the environment, man-made fibers release microfibers into our water ways, which are polluting the ocean. Fish have been caught that have balls of microfibers in their stomachs, and even people are thought to have microfibers circulating in our bodies. These microfibers are terrible for the oceans and may have an effect on our health. Scientists are trying to study whether microfibers cause inflammation, which could implicate these fibers in cancer. Man made fibers also often require toxic chemicals to be created, which harm the workers who make the fibers. There is no perfect solution, but I think figuring out how to filter out micro plastics or making synthetic fibers that don't harm the workers who create them and can properly decompose or be recycled easily would be sustainable solutions.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:I think there's a very good reason for 100% wool sweaters being harder to find: wool is a very weak fiber, difficult to care for, and itchy.

text:Future of fibers?	labels:Increasing rate of consumption of natural fibers is also terrible for the environment - mass production of cotton is environmentally atrocious. The shipment of sustainable clothing from Ukraine to New York, for example, is also really bad environmentally. If it is a concern for you and you're able, I would suggest looking into local producers; this includes designers, fibre producers, factories, dyers, etc etc. Thats the best way to ensure minimal impact of clothing on the environment.  However, not always practical or possible.
text:> I would suggest looking into local producers  I want this to be the future of not just fashion but the whole global economy. So many places (at least in the US) have lost "local flavor" to global brands, and that minimizes the diversity of options, competition, innovation, and perspectives in fashion and every industry. We need to move towards a better balance of local and global production and identify ways we can strengthen small businesses and enable them to compete and (re)establish a local culture.	labels:Yeah, i agree completely. Its difficult to actually do often (i live in reasonably northern Canada, like not North but we do not have a winter growing season of any appreciable value) so if i don't want to like get scurvy in the winter I won't be buying local.   But listening to first nations peoples and incorporating traditional health knowledge would be a way to solve this issue - is that going to happen on a large scale, probably not.

Capsule wardrobe is not for me, I don't own many clothes but seeing the same 8 tops every day is depressing to me.
text:Oh! That's interesting, I feel less sure about taking the course after reading comments.  Did you feel that her style personality categories were too rigid? Another comment mentioned that she apparently uses "five fashion personalities".  If you watched her YouTube channel, would you say her course goes a lot deeper than it, or can you basically get the idea from watching her YouTube?	labels:Hi, sorry for super late reply!  I didn't really felt like the fashion personnalities were too rigid, but she uses seasons to describe different kind of people and what color scheme looks good on them.  While it's not super rigid and she does mention it's just an advice, I ended up not wanting to wear some clothes I loved just because of it. I'm also not sure I agree with the classification. For exemple, I think I'm supposed to be a Winter type (cold, bright colors), but I find that a dark orange looks ok on me. Maybe I got my type wrong though !  I think it gets more in-depth than her YouTube videos, but the fashion advice she gives can all be found somewhere else online. It's just handier and she is very clear in her explanations, which is nice. There is also a very helpful community.  I hope this helps :)	episode_done:True
text:How do I figure out my "style"?	labels:I think start by looking at pictures online on Pinterest or Instagram of styles you find aesthetically pleasing and create a little dashboard with outfits that catch your eye. You can also think about some of your favourite actors or singers that wear outfits you like and try to save the pictures you find. After that i would go window-shopping online on websites that fit your budget and look around trying to find pieces similar to any outfits you saw. fyi; i would browse on a website first and then go to the actual store to try out what you saw online, it gives you an idea of what you’re looking for.  I think imitation is the easiest way to start finding your style. Once your comfortable in a type of style you can start experimenting with it and picking more personalized pieces. Good luck :)
text:I've tried that but feel like the outfits are too much for a casual stop at the grocery store. Any tips on that?	labels:Part of it is accepting that it's okay to dress up for the everyday. You do everyday stuff every day so why would you exclude those things from opportunities to feel like your best self?   Now is, I think, a perfect time to play around with atypical/"special"/non-casual pieces in every day wear. There's been a great blurring of lines between occaisions and I'm seeing lots of real business wear matched with casual items, like pencil skirts with chuck taylors or dress pants and denim jackets. Ultimately, it is the full package more so than indivdiual pieces that make an outfit appropriate for a situation. That isn't to say that there aren't specific items that are inherently inappropriate for some settings, but that at least some of the partitions we've placed between items of clothing are unnecessary and arbitrary, and they prevent creative engagement with your closet.	episode_done:True

I think imitation is the easiest way to start finding your style. Once your comfortable in a type of style you can start experimenting with it and picking more personalized pieces. Good luck :)
text:I've tried that but feel like the outfits are too much for a casual stop at the grocery store. Any tips on that?	labels:My style aspiration has always been something analogous to let's say upper east side. Completely not practical for my budget or lifestyle. For awhile I avoided it, but honestly I didn't really feel like I came into my own style wise until I figured out how to adapt things to my own life.   What I liked was a put together look, polished accessories, and femme style.   For me that means combining dressy with casual. The skirt goes with sneakers. Instead of a blouse, I might wear a tee shirt. Instead of heels - fancy flats. And overall I found my own interpretation of things.	episode_done:True
text:How do I figure out my "style"?	labels:I think start by looking at pictures online on Pinterest or Instagram of styles you find aesthetically pleasing and create a little dashboard with outfits that catch your eye.

text:I've tried that but feel like the outfits are too much for a casual stop at the grocery store. Any tips on that?	labels:I look for ways they can be made more casual by focusing on the silhouettes or components. My Pinterest is full of wool trousers, delicate gauzy blouses, full skirts, and chunky sweaters. I probably wouldn't wear an outfit with all of those components to the grocery store, but I might wear mom jeans with a pretty blouse and Keds, or a more casual skirt with a chunky sweater and some flat ankle boots, for example.

text:How do I figure out my "style"?	labels:I recommend doing two things:   1 - look at your current wardrobe and pick out what outfits you consider your favorite. Ask yourself why you gravitate to those items. Is it a color? A theme? A certain look? Those are some clues to your style.   2 - if you follow fashion bloggers or general fashion posts, ask yourself why you follow them. There is a likelihood that you follow them because you like their look/style.    Now, with more insight into what style you currently have and styles you aspire to have, you may get closer to defining your style. Don't feel too bad if you can't explicitly name it (ie: preppy, vintage, casual, etc). Your personal style is more nuanced and probably a combination of multiple categories.

text:How do I figure out my "style"?	labels:I would agree with a lot of the other advice here-look at what you like in your closet, why you like those, look on pinterest instagram etc. I would also mention that you can start out shopping or just browsing online for things you like. Once you have an idea of what you are looking for you can check online stores that have locations in your area. That way when you go out shopping you arent as overwhelmed and have a plan going into it.   Covid permitting ofc	episode_done:True
text:How do I figure out my "style"?	labels:Something that helped me find out what my style was has been looking at celebritys/pinterest boards outfits and seeing what I liked. Then I figured out why I liked that. After that I looked at what I already had and cleared out the things I didn't like or wear and determined what I needed (basics, staples).  To start shopping for me it is helpful to have an idea of what I'm looking for or what stores I like so it doesn't get overwhelming.  I also recommend beginning to look online. It is easier to do a little at a time and you can see what's in stock at stores near you.   Also recommend depop!! Find what you like, you can follow people with similar style or size	episode_done:True
text:How do I figure out my "style"?	labels:Your “style” is basically what you are comfortable in. If you are not comfortable browsing the mall for hours then it’s obviously not your thing. Although what we wear do play a factor in how people perceive us we cant really let that affect our style, because at the end of the day literally everyone has their own opinion and you cant make everyone happy. You can only make yourself happy so do whats best for you. Other than that if you do want to experiment with various aesthetics but Don’t wanna spend time at the mall just shop online, or maybe try thrifting (just give everything a wash first).	episode_done:True
text:For those who actually MISS clothes/makeup/getting dressed up.	labels:Here with you. I've started getting dressed and putting on makeup just to stay at home all day and it helps my mood for sure, but the times I do get to go out I get *so* excited for. I'll dress up just to for a fire in someone's backyard. But on the upside, getting dressed just to sit at home gives me a lot more confidence to try things I wouldn't have tried before and hopefully will be more comfortable wearing when restrictions lift.	episode_done:True
text:For those who actually MISS clothes/makeup/getting dressed up.	labels:GIRL, ME. I miss dressing up so much! I've been dressing and doing my makeup to run errands, but it just doesn't feel as fun when I have to wear a mask and I'm not out with friends.   I miss wearing heels. I miss wearing lipstick. I miss being able to wear statement earrings without them getting caught in my mask loops. I miss wearing bronzer and blush. I miss being able to do my hair (I mostly keep it up when I go out, to avoid it getting tangled with my mask loops). I MISS SHOPPING WITH FRIENDS.   Ugh. I just wanna do my makeup and wear bright red lipstick (Patrick Ta's "She's Not From Here") and put on a really cute outfit, and go out shopping and then to lunch with friends. There's so much we took for granted 😭	episode_done:True
text:For those who actually MISS clothes/makeup/getting dressed up.	labels:I miss getting dressed a lot. I don’t really have lounge clothes, just exercise, so I was really struggling with clothing at the beginning of this.   Additionally, I just graduated my masters program, and my job during the school year essentially had a uniform, so I was really excited about graduating and starting a new job to get dressed again. And then here we are.   I also miss getting dressed for occasions. I already had my graduation outfits picked out, and had three weddings this summers that I was looking forward to wearing dresses to. Going to the grocery store is now the only time I can put on clothing and I’m just really sad. I know there’s a lot of people who are like “just wear your clothing in your house!” Which yes, I can definitely do that. But part of the joy of getting dressed for me was the “going somewhere” part. Picking out my outfit felt like I was putting on a costume to play a part for the day, which I loved. I know I am so so fortunate that I can safely work from home; but I really miss my “characters”. Wedding guest, or fancy date night, or professional worker in winter. All those roles have been reduced to WFH and grocery shopper now and I’m just really sad about it.	episode_done:True
text:For those who actually MISS clothes/makeup/getting dressed up.	labels:I just feel bad that as soon as I got to the point of having upgraded most of my pieces and wearing nicer fabrics, etc, I would have been the same off with just keeping my crappier clothes.  Also in my early 30s in the city.   But, I will say that the quarantine helped me start exploring the wide leg pant look, and dressing glamorously when I do leave the house because who the fuck cares now? They can't even see my face.	episode_done:True
text:For those who actually MISS clothes/makeup/getting dressed up.	labels:I have worked from home for years, I also was a competitive athlete so I basically have lived in comfy/workout attire for as long as I can remember. My new job is uniform based. I love fashion though, and used to go out more and dabbled in some modeling. Last night I was in my closet and noticed my section of "nice" clothes; dresses, pencil skirts, leather jackets, things I had carefully selected and curated over the years. It seems like it's all from another life now and makes me sad.	episode_done:True

TBH I’m still doing a full face of makeup most days and wearing my favorite summer dresses around the house a few times a week.

But heck, do I miss getting all made up and going out! lol I have 2 new cashmere sweaters from Eric Bompard, a baguette purse from Leo et Violette, a vintage silk Bvlgari silk scarf I snatched off ebay, Bally pumps... all waiting for the time to get dressed up and show off, and no place to go \*weeps\*	episode_done:True
text:For those who actually MISS clothes/makeup/getting dressed up.	labels:I just still get dressed. Nobody is stopping me! My morning routine includes changing, and on "weekends" (days my SO is off work) I wear house dresses or leggings, but the rest of the time I put real outside clothes on. I still spend time trying out new outfits, to keep it fresh since I'm not buying much right now. I'd encourage you to try it out, even if you don't have plans to leave the house! I joined a facebook group called "I'm high and this is what I'm wearing" and post there on days I feel the need to share my outfits but won't see anyone.	episode_done:True

text:Inspo Album- Thinking outside granny square	labels:As the OP of that thread, thank you! I misrepresented my point by putting knits at odds with maximalism when I really was just trying to find a word to describe the overtly hard/uncomfortable trend elements like studs, leather, sequins, etc. I actually love maximalism, the minimalist look is not for me as I'm not a "fashion body" who can really pull off the minimalist look, and I love color and texture. Thank you for including buyable items! I'm learning more about fashion every day and your insight into how designers are reinventing the way their methods and materials are perceived is much appreciated.
text:Thanks for chiming in! I was reading your answers and felt like you were trying to convey something like that, but people had already had the image of sweaters and loungewear in their head so it was hard to communicate that.

text:Fast Fashion: What are your wardrobe all-stars?	labels:I tend to purchase from Old Navy, Target, and various mall brands most often. I get pretty good longevity out of most of what I buy. I especially like to get athletic wear from Old Navy. My current supply of compression shorts/leggings from Old Navy are from 2016.  These are some of my longest lived items from fast fashion.  Fleece fall coat from TJ Maxx - 2012 - This was my go-to coat for chilly weather for several years. Now I just wear it for an extra layer on cold hikes, but it's still in really good condition. Has a couple of burn marks on the sleeve from bonfires though.  Running shorts (Nike knock-offs) from Wal-Mart - 2012 - I bought 2 pairs when I started running back then and 1 pair finally failed on me this past week (thread came out of the decorative piping). These have been a godsend during my pregnancy this summer (comfy elastic band for my growing stomach) and I've actually bought 4 more pairs off Poshmark to keep them in my rotation.  Navy blue trouser slacks from New York & Co. - 2014 - I bought these shortly after starting my first job after college. Wore them a lot at that first job, not as much at my second since I could wear jeans instead.	episode_done:True
text:Fast Fashion: What are your wardrobe all-stars?	labels:* H&M mini-length black pencil skirt with floral embroidery. I almost bought the dress version of this as well since I love the embroidery so much. The first time I wore it was to the mall and the sales assistant of a different store asked me if it was a Dior piece, I was super stoked.  * Zara kids olive drape-y trench. I'm petit enough to fit into Zara's kids stuff and this trench was like half the price of a very similar looking women's trench (also Zara). It's very versatile, my cost per wear is \~$1.50  I have some pieces that I bought off Taobao (black pleated mini skirt, my only pair of denim shorts, a white short sleeve blouse, and a lavender knit top) that's also around the $1.00 per wear.	episode_done:True
text:Fast Fashion: What are your wardrobe all-stars?	labels:Green fir and flare dress from H&M-- I bought this in 2014-15 when dresses didn't resemble potato sacks and this has been a tried and true piece for me.  While it is a summer dress, a cardigan (or a blazer, but I find those uncomfortable and would only wear one for a job interview) makes this cold weather (please please get here!) appropritae.  Cranberry velvet dress from Primark.  I paid $2 for this on a clearance rack.  The next year, I was invited to a nonprofit fundraiser with a friend and threw this on last minute (I changed in my office bathroom) for this fundraiser.  One of the guests at this fundraiser was a (now grown) child actor (now married) who has been on his fair share of red carpets.  His wife commented on how much she loved my dress.  To think someone who's walked Hollywood red carpets complimented on a $3 dress.  Target Xhilaration coat-- this is a mint green peacoat bought when the twee aesthetic (which is one I'm drawn to) was more popular (Before everything was boxy and oversized).  I'm going on my 5th or 6th winter with it.	episode_done:True
text:Fast Fashion: What are your wardrobe all-stars?	labels:I have an old pair of jeans from target, probably 8 years old and one of those lines they don’t make anymore.

text:Fast Fashion: What are your wardrobe all-stars?	labels:I have a Charlot Russe dusty pink off the shoulder dress. Brought it last minute when attending a wedding. I love it. I get compliments on it all the time and it has stood the test of time.   H&M crop long-sleeved dusty pink laced top. I don't know how old this is but it has a pink tag on it and all my coworkers (At H&M) state that it means its supper old. My classmate gave it to me and I love it.   H&M Big fur coat. Super warm and nicely oversized. Makes me feel like a sugar baby  Most of my shoes. I have like two non-fast fashioned shoes. But everything else is fast fashion and they rock.	episode_done:True
text:Fast Fashion: What are your wardrobe all-stars?	labels:A long black cardigan from Primark. I picked it up when I accidentally lost my sweater while at a work conference and couldn't bear the thought of spending the next few days in air conditioned conference rooms without some kind of replacement, and I was also on a pretty tight budget. It's one of my favorite pieces of clothing that I own. And it has pockets!  A solid black tee that I bought at Dress Barn a decade ago. It has a great slim fit, and it's soft and not at all see-through. I've worn it probably at least every other week (if not more often), and it's still in great condition.  A long lightweight grey sweater from H&M that I bought on a whim years ago. It's cut in such a way that it can either be worn as a duster sweater or can be tied in the front for a shorter trendier look. It was less than $10 and I honestly didn't expect it to last for more than a few washes, but it's one of my favorites and has held up far better than I expected.	episode_done:True

text:Fast Fashion: What are your wardrobe all-stars?	labels:A maxi skirt with a slit from H&M, I wear it so much my friends find it weird when I wear pants. Looks good with literally everything, and it’s perfect for when I feel like not wearing pants but also don’t want to shave. Win win.  A velvet cami from SheIn before it was popular haha, I eventually got more colours and they’re still holding strong a couple of years later.  Knit sandals from amazon, fav purchase ever!

text:Let's Talk about hats	labels:There is hat etiquette from the days of yore. Here are some of the conventions that were adhered to:  A lady does not remove her hat when indoors or for the national anthem. This is in contrast to men, who are to remove hats when indoors and for the anthem. However, if you‘re sporting a baseball cap at a ballgame, I would remove it for the anthem, whereas if you were wearing a more formal outfit with hat then I would not remove it.  A hat is a daytime piece in most cases not suitable for evening wear. The fascinator is an exception to this rule, but is more of a Commonwealth/British thing.

text:Let's Talk about hats	labels:Don't wear them inside. But that one is pretty spoken. Edit: inside a house. Not like shopping at the mall or as a required element of your job uniform...  Don't buy them too tight - it's tempting to ensure they don't fall off your head but they'll leave red marks on your forehead.  Remember to wear forehead sunscreen if youre wearing a backwards baseball cap or you'll have a very, very strange tan line. Thats not from experience at all...
text:Girl if I go to the trouble to put on a hat and secure it to my head, you better believe I'm keeping that shit on inside.   If you take it off, it ruins the security previously established when you left home, never to be attained again on the go, you inevitably have hat hair, and then you have to carry it or put it somewhere, which is annoying.   Wear your hats inside! No one cares!	labels:Its generally considered very rude to wear a hat inside someones house in my area (and many others) which is why I mentioned it. I wouldnt actually say anything to someone who wore a hat in my house bc thats super awkward and rude lol. Of course this may vary with location and absolutely never applies to religious head coverings.

text:Let's Talk about hats	labels:Don't wear them inside. But that one is pretty spoken. Edit: inside a house. Not like shopping at the mall or as a required element of your job uniform...  Don't buy them too tight - it's tempting to ensure they don't fall off your head but they'll leave red marks on your forehead.  Remember to wear forehead sunscreen if youre wearing a backwards baseball cap or you'll have a very, very strange tan line. Thats not from experience at all...

text:How do you balance bright statement pieces with a capsule wardrobe?	labels:Its ok if a strict capsule doesn't work for you. Everyone's capsule can be different. You could have a secondary casule for your bright stuff to mix and match if you want! It's all about what works for you.
text:And that may very well be. My idea for wanting to set up a capsule wardrobe was because in the last 5 years, I've moved 7 times, so I'm trying to keep my clothing as little as possible. With a capsule wardrobe, I can have, say, 20-30 pieces and 50+ outfits with them instead of having 20-30 pieces of non-matching color schemes and having maybe 20 outfits.	labels:One more thing, if you can narrow your colors a little, it helps with cohesiveness. Like 1-2 neutrals and 2-3 colors for everything else. You still get some color, but there are a few limits. I have a rule that all my patterns need to have at least one of my colors in it. The primary color should be one of my neutrals or one of my colors, and then it can have anything else after that! If it is a pattern that prioritizes my neutral, then it also needs one of the actual colors too. In my world, that means, if I get a floral item with black, then it should have some pink. It can't be only blues, reds. and greens.
text:Ooo, I like your idea about the prints having a color in your color scheme! That’s something I’ve never thought of but I like the idea of. I have to go check my dresses now to see how close I am! :)	labels:It makes it easier for me to say no to items as well. :P I have tried multiple times to make navy and white dresses work in my wardrobe and they never get worn. Now they are banned!	episode_done:True

text:I love this idea! Thanks!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:How do you balance bright statement pieces with a capsule wardrobe?	labels:I don't have a capsule wardrobe per se, but I do have a color palette that isn't exclusively neutrals that (imo) goes together. I have some neutrals (warm gray tones, black, off-white, camel) and some colors (forest green, red orange). I have suit jackets in each of the colors I've listed above and camis in each color as well; I tend to stick to neutral bottoms (white or black jeans) so my tops are more colorful. I don't think a capsule has to be exclusively neutral, but do try to pick a family of colors that work together (e.g. all of my color choices are warm-toned vs. cool toned greens, reds, greys, etc.).

text:How do you balance bright statement pieces with a capsule wardrobe?	labels:I’m a believer in color families with random pops of color.

text:How do you balance bright statement pieces with a capsule wardrobe?	labels:I think jewelry and/or accessories can be a good idea for your loud/bold statement pieces. Earrings, necklaces, bracelets, belts, hats, etc. They are more transferable and they can be incorporated with a lot of clothing.	episode_done:True
text:How do you balance bright statement pieces with a capsule wardrobe?	labels:Expand your definition of "statement piece" to include texture, pattern, silhouette, and x-factors instead of just colors vs neutrals. A shiny pant makes a statement even if it's black. An oversized blazer makes a statement even if it's tan. A snake print bag or skirt  makes a statement even if it's shades of brown or grey.   Some other ideas that might help: make color decisions based on seasons - if you have a lot of winterwear you love in a certain color scheme, start there and weed out what doesn't go with those faves, and so on with the other seasons. Make pinterest boards with the colors you're considering. Take pictures of combinations you like. Consider what colors you like best on yourself.	episode_done:True

So if you can pare down your shoe collection to go with most of your clothes I think you wouldn't have trouble having a large-ish wardrobe.
text:That makes sense! I should have clarified, this time I'm moving to the other hemisphere so I have a suitcase worth of space and a carry-on to pack all of my life into, so my space will be extremely limited! Hopefully we'll stay there a while so it will be worth it to us to get a storage unit shipped to us with our other things eventually, but that will be a few years down the road.	labels:Vacuum bags! I’ve moved internationally many times and the bags that suck all the air out are fantastic. Would highly recommend them!

text:What do you think are the pieces of jewelry everyone should own?	labels:I used to follow the outfit challenges and posts on the blog Putting Me Together and I really like her approach - instead of specific items, it’s more like categories of items. Long drapey necklace. Statement necklace. Short necklace. Neutral dangly earrings. Statement earrings. Stuff like that! That way you can find what suits you within the category so it can be classic and something you will actually wear!
text:That’s exactly where I’ve gotten my inspiration from. Too many lists are dated on materials and wear but finding things like length and level of boldness are actually smart. I can’t tell you how “timeless” every yellow gold piece I got in childhood was out of style all through my twenties because white gold came in. Minimal jewelry was nearly out unless it was a signature piece. My dangly earrings over the years have changed but I always have at least one, same with my long necklace and my version of statement pieces.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Yes! My first purchase to myself when I got promoted at my job was a giant solitaire fire opal ring set in gold. I have two opal rings and an opal necklace since then. Opal is the best gemstone.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Opals are so lovely. I would agree here, jewelry can be so subjective I would say pearl, diamond, gold and silver/white gold studs (or good looking imitations of any/all depending on budget) are good any occasion go to pieces. Even a standard pearl necklace or even studs isn’t necessarily going to be something someone with an edgier asthmatic would go for, I think standards fall more in to categories- daily wear, statement and fancy. For more of an upper class type of vibe I’d say for necklaces a diamond collar style or choker for fancy, pearl strand and perhaps something with a tasteful small scale  pendant or single colored stone for everyday and a funky maybe chunky mixed metals or stones piece for statement. Edgier might be a sharp glitter crusted but not over large ice pick pendant (icicle? Skinny inverted triangle shape...I’m sure they are called something else but I cannot think of the proper name) on a standard 18-20” braided or box chain for everyday, large round stone on a long  chain for fancy and a chain mail type collar for statement. Personally my go to pendants are a sparkly star which was my first real diamond jewelry and a cz unicorn my husband got me on a thin but not super fine chain and rose gold bezel set cz studs for every day. Little dress I change up the earrings to something with a dangle and if I’m going fancy I have a choker (on me) with white gold alternating small ‘bars’ and geometric balls and I add a long chain with a chunky pendant. Favorite statement piece is a Betsy Johnson with a large fixed crystal pineapple.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:What do you think are the pieces of jewelry everyone should own?	labels:Please never take advice from "X things everyone should own" lists. There is nothing everyone "should" own. Not diamonds, not pearls, none of it.   It's all based on your own preferences, needs, and lifestyle.  What do YOU like? What is your personality like? What do you wear? What kind of lifestyle do you have? What is your fashion style and "look" like? What are your undertones? What is your budget?  Answering those questions may help someone give you advice regarding jewelry. Prescriptive "everyone should own" lists are completely worthless.
text:You are so right!   My signature clothing style is Boho/Cowgirl/Hippie, so even though I own the pearls and diamond studs, I’ve not worn them in years. However my Native American squash blossoms, Navajo pearls and turquoise cuff bracelets get worn literally everywhere, every day. Probably going to sell off the former to buy more of the latter, because there is no such thing as too much Turquoise!	labels:	episode_done:True
text:What do you think are the pieces of jewelry everyone should own?	labels:This is one of those things you need to pick according to what you like. Classic jewellery can look outdated.  For example, I have no interest in diamonds so have no interest in owning any (Or any imitation ones), although I would say the diamond studs are the closest to timeless you'll get. I do like pearls, but until quite recently they were not "fashionable" and read as either dated or a statement piece, depending on how you styled them and who you were. Also, pearls come in different shapes and I think the baroque pearls were less "old lady" than round ones. But Im.not sure if they were ever mainstream popular or just Etsy-boho crowd popular? So, no not necessarily timeless looking. Another thing with real pearls is they are not stones and they are perishable. They will deteriorate if you don't care for/store them correctly. If you can't be bothered with that then get glass, Swarovski make nice ones.  Turquoise and coral read as very 2000s to me (It's lovely but it just seems that way to me!) and amber very "middle aged art teacher". So again, a stone might not seem timeless. Size and shape and length of beaded necklaces go in and out of style too.  As for types, I don't like bracelets/watches much , and rings don't suit my lifestyle anymore so I don't wear any of my collection now.   Basicly, buy things you like that go with what you wear and suit your lifestyle. If you want to invest in beautiful pieces you love then do it, but don't expect any of it to be "timeless"/always look contemporary.	episode_done:True
text:What do you think are the pieces of jewelry everyone should own?	labels:I think a lot of other people have hammered in the point that jewelry is personal, and that lists like these aren't necessarily helpful. But here's a list of my must-haves.  1. super small gold huggie hoop earrings 2. medium 1-2" gold hoop earrings 3. long dangly statement gold earrings 4. gold choker necklace  5. gold delicate pendant necklace, sits around your collarbone 6. long, large pendant necklace 7. sparkly stud earrings 8. jade pendant necklace  I don't like wearing jewelry on my hands, except for my wedding ring. I also much prefer gold over silver-- the yellower the better.	episode_done:True
text:What do you think are the pieces of jewelry everyone should own?	labels:I don’t know about everyone but for me there are pieces of jewelry I own that even if not currently trendy I still use and reach for time and time again.  Hoop earrings - not large and not too small - a pair in gold and a pair in silver.   Diamond studs. Pearl studs.  Thin bangle bracelets - again silver and gold.  Thick cuffs. Depending on my outfit I like having the weight of a cuff on my wrist. It can make me feel like Wonder Woman!  I think bold rings are beautiful on my hands. I have a ring my Mom gave me. It’s an oval dome turquoise stone set in gold. It’s an unusual piece and I love it!   I have a good quality watch I only used for special occasions because it clashes with my Fitbit.  I have a very old (60+) gold crucifix with intricate open scroll work and a tiny red ruby in the center. It’s about an inch long and I’ve been searching for the right chain so it lays right about my cleavage. The gold is from Greece so it’s hard to match the color of the gold. I would wear this all the time.	episode_done:True
text:What do you think are the pieces of jewelry everyone should own?	labels:I agree with the general sentiment that there's no jewelry you "need" to own or that fits all lifestyles. I've had the same 6 rings on for years, I don't take them off ever, no matter how casual or fancy an event. I have two holes in each ear but can't remember the last time I wore earrings, I can wear a necklace for a bit but after a few hours it bugs me to have something constantly touching my neck. That said, I do have pieces from my grandmother I like to break out occasionally; a (fake) ivory elephant pendant and a turquoise penguin necklace. I wear her opal ring every day. My engagement ring will have her sapphires in it.   That said, if you're looking for some basics I think your list sounds great. I'd look more at your own wardrobe than trends to decide whether you lean toward cool silver or warm gold, your occupation to decide whether hoops or studs are more practical, your social activities to decide whether you'd like to invest in true gemstones or costume jewelry. Maybe a few pendant you love and chains of varying widths/lengths so it's as versatile as possible?	episode_done:True
text:Fold VS Hang	labels:It really depends on the garment and it's composition.  Dresses and skirts - hang them.  Shirts/blouses are better hung but can be folded.  Trousers can go either way.  Anything that is going to get fold creases in it I hang.	episode_done:True
text:Fold VS Hang	labels:What about dump in a heap on the floor?  Just kidding!  I do the Konmari method for anything I don’t mind ironing.  It really does save more space; and I do it for my entire family.  The things I don’t fold are heavy wool items that are woven (most formal fall/winter things); but I will fold light dresses since I iron them before every wear anyway.	episode_done:True
text:Fold VS Hang	labels:I hang most my tops, as it simply makes sense for me to have everything in one place and makes getting dressed easier in the morning. Fold trousers, comfies and similar clothing.  The type of hanger you get will matter too! I invested in the slim black velvet ones a few years back and it’s been fantastic, I would highly recommend it!
text:The slim black velvet hangers are great, but they’re kind of fragile in my experience. If you’re moving a lot they might not hold up very well. If you can afford to replace at least some of your hangers every time you move though, I would definitely go that route!	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Fold VS Hang	labels:I fold almost everything - living in NY with very limited closet space, I have to save it for the nicest pieces. Most of my clothes are dryer-friendly so if something I've folded looks really rough, I'll spritz it with a spray bottle and throw it in the dryer with towels for like ten min. But uh..... a lot of times I just wear clothes with creases in them ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯	episode_done:True

text:Discussion: Clay Jewelry?	labels:There's some potters in my area that make amazing porcelain jewelry and I'd totally recommend it! I have some pieces from Jenna Vanden Brink that I love. Reiko Yamamota is another with cool minimal jewelry. I'm pretty sure they're both on Etsy.	episode_done:True
text:Discussion: Clay Jewelry?	labels:I have seen some really cool clay things, and I recently got a pair of earrings. In the end I was disappointed, while the pair I got is absolutely beautiful, the actually earring post was low quality (especially for the price) and changed colors after just a couple of months and a few wears. I would be interested in a brand that offers higher quality finishings.	episode_done:True
text:Discussion: Clay Jewelry?	labels:I love clay earrings. You can find something for anyone if you look for the quality artists. Big kitschy earrings, tiny dainty ones, etc. There are some true artisans out there. We’re seeing a huge surge of small shops of various crafts (bows makers, tumbler makers, sewists, clay) because of the pandemic and people needing to find hobbies. Which I love. Everyone should have an outlet. But not everyone needs to sell their pieces. You can enjoy things without monetizing them. Every hobby doesn’t need to be a hustle.	episode_done:True
text:Discussion: Clay Jewelry?	labels:I love polymer clay earrings (at least those made by the more skilled makers). The look is exactly the aesthetic I go for, and after years of feeling very meh about various precious metal jewelry, it was a relief to finally find this style. What kind of bugs me is that occasionally I've had pairs fall apart on me, whether the clay itself or the hot glue holding the studs on. I guess quality just varies dramatically from person to person, and it's tough to tell since we're buying from individuals selling their own creations on Etsy (and I want to support them in the end, so it's not really a big deal).	episode_done:True
text:Discussion: Clay Jewelry?	labels:I have several clay earrings. They may look heavy, but they actually aren’t. I highly recommend!	episode_done:True
text:Discussion: Clay Jewelry?	labels:I love / hate them.  They can be so beautiful, but so so so fragile.  I just recently purchased two pairs of clay earrings from a local ceramic artist at our farmers market, however, I’ve already dropped and shattered one of them already.  Every clay set of jewelry (earrings and pendant necklace) I’ve ever owned has eventually broken - baring this last set of yellow earrings I’m now handling with extreme care.  They are beautiful and I’ll probably buy more because I love this girl’s work, but I just have to know going into it that this is not something I’ll most likely be able to keep forever and pass on, so I keep that in mind regarding price when purchasing them.	episode_done:True
text:Discussion: Clay Jewelry?	labels:I think they are beautiful and that artists can get really creative with clay, resin, whatever. Like dried flowers encased in resin? Gorgeous.  My only concerns are practical. Sometimes, the material can be too heavy for my earlobes. (That comes with these earrings being statement pieces, I guess.) I’ve also noticed that not all artisans/brands know the earring post/earwire materials (or even if the material is “hypoallergenic”.)
text:Honestly I feel like clip-on earrings are underrated. It depends on the style as not all styles could accommodate a clip, but for larger statement earrings I often wish I could get a clip instead of a post because I also find them heavy and I don’t like the swinging feeling.	labels:	episode_done:True

Primark tshirt WERE shite quality tissue feeling crap, (worse than the cheapcheapcheap stuff we used to get from the market stalks) in the early 2000s but I've got some now that are 10 years old and still wearable out if the house. The last thing that died in laundry was a fluffy jumper I bought in 3 colours in 2018. One of them unravelled in multiple places first wash.

If your washing machine sucks, hate to break it to you, but you need to hand wash anything you aren't willing to sacrifice to the laundry gods.

text:I may be totally wrong, but I bet at least some of those "my clothes fall apart after first wash" may just be people laundering their own clothes for the first time and not really knowing that figuring out your washing machine and its settings is quite significant to how your clothes will come out.  My clothes looked rough when I used to just dump them all in a big ball into a laundrette washing machine and tumble dry them. Now that I have my own washing machine, use custom settings and and air dry the clothes (or hand wash in the sink if needed), they stay looking new way longer.	labels:I also think it has to do with the quality of the clothes and isn't always the washers fault.

Also: buying poor quality clothes made from synthetic materials.

As to your second point, good point. Other than underwear thats true I do wear everything 2-3 times before washing.  Like I do believe people when they say the qash shreds their clothes, to be clear. I just genuinely don't understand what is doing it.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:I've done my laundry for 20 years, using laundry bags, special detergent, gentle cycling. Silk, cashmere, underwire bras (REALLY use the bag here), sneakers it's all fine! Just dry on a flat surface.  I usually have no problem until cotton tshirts the last couple of years. A cotton tshirt should be fine at 40^o C. It's the recommendation on the label. But a few has instantly lost inches in high and transfererad it to width. And it's a ridiculous difference. All my husbands tshirts are fine though, it's only mine getting ruined.	labels:> But a few has instantly lost inches in high and transfererad it to width.   I think that's an issue with construction. Cotton fabric has a grain to it and if the pieces of the garment are not lined up properly according to the grain, washing it even carefully will cause the garment to warp.	episode_done:True
text:Learning about technical side of clothes - fabrics, care, quality etc.	labels:It seems the current census is that no brand can be trusted to keep a high quality, and 30+ year old vintage is the only way.  Brands might be lauded for their quality/price for a few years until the constant push for higher profit every year makes them produce the same disappointing clothes as all other dying mid-range brands.  I never really see quality as a selling point for clothes anymore. It might be hidden in some company statement with promises of green washing. But all brands want you to come back the next season, not encourage you to buy and use something for *years*.	episode_done:True

A huge section on laundry and clothing repairs. The rest is from looking up how to make or care for things online. Learning to knit helped!   I learned hand Washing in university when our washing machine broke and the landlord didn't fix it for 3 months. I couldn't afford to keep taking my every day clothes to the launderette so I had to learn how to properly wash different things in the sink. Turns out it isn't difficult.

text:Totally.  To me, Gen Z is a lot of clothing that isn’t work appropriate but super fun. A lot of crop tops, bra tops, spaghetti straps, usually some tummy showing, and then some baggy pants. Lots of thrifting and also cheap fast fashion. Doc Martens and other platform shoes. Very 90s/early 2000s. Long acrylic nails, false lashes. Really fun and can be a really “hot but trashy” style   Millennial fashion is more professional/better quality/structured. Linens, trousers, heels, sandals, etc. Frankly I think it has to do with millennials having more money. Low key hair, nails and makeup. Neutral colours and patterns. It’s a more mature style   I’m 25 so I get to do both 😎 woohoo	labels:I don't think it's that millennials have more money, it's that we are older, and more likely to be in the professional job phase of life. Millenials also wore crop tops and baggy pants, in the late 90s/early 2000s when they were cool the first time around.
text:I think it has a little to do with it! A lot of teenagers can only really afford to thrift/buy fast fashion.  Whereas now that millennials are getting older, we ofc have to buy more professional clothing, but we also have the funds to buy clothes and accessories made out of better quality fabrics and materials. I think wearing polyester vs cashmere sweaters makes a big difference in style   Def not saying one is better than the other and that ALL millennials spend a lot of money on clothes, but it’s def a trend	labels:	episode_done:True

Millennial fashion is put-together and professional, while it’s cool for Gen Z to, for example, wear clothes that are obviously from  the thrift store (generalizing).   I think it could partly have something to do with the larger influence of digital “aesthetic” pics on gen z. I’m on the cusp since I was born in 98 and i was really influenced by aesthetic tumblr and instagram photos growing up. like in 2014 i had a huge black-and-white grid, arctic monkeys, lana del rey, black-and-white striped turtleneck and black skater skirt tumblr phase and even though it’s not my style anymore, looking back on the aesthetics of that now, it makes me feel so nostalgic. that style for me is more about feeling dreamy and nostalgic than it is about looking good/attractive for other people. i’ve noticed that people younger than me will take that kind of thing further. an outfit creating nostalgic vibes is more important than it looking professional and presentable.   I also think that Gen Z style is less afraid to be matchy-matchy (which is such a taboo for more effortless, elegant Millennials). I think this also has to do with Gen Z style that is meant to achieve a certain aesthetic/vibe/fantasy.  I also think that growing up, Gen Z was more saturated with images and marketing, so being unique and original is more valued.	episode_done:True

text:Wardrobe Problems: Separates	labels:Without knowing what your pants/skirts look like, it’s hard to say exactly.

text:Wardrobe Problems: Separates	labels:I kind of ran into this problem since I purged most my summer wardrobe last year, and the core of the rest of my wardrobe is dresses, which I just don’t like as much in summer.  I do think that if you’re just not going to choose separates over single pieces, foregoing them entirely is completely valid, once you’re not handicapping yourself.  What worked for me, since I ended up with a ton of midi skirts I really liked, but felt apathetic towards tops, was to just go the solid colour, traditionally flattering route (which I think is the smartest way of tackling elements of clothing you don’t care that much for.)  If I’m wearing separates, I’m always going to choose my bottom first, so not having to think much about what to pair them with is nice.	episode_done:True
text:Wardrobe Problems: Separates	labels:I also struggle with summer tops! I have lots of options for sweaters to wear with skirts and pants, and a few blouses (but I've always worked in business casual environments in cold climates so sweaters make more sense for me), but once summer hits I'm like ????? and just end up wearing my handful of work-appropriate dresses or t-shirts with the trousers and skirts and pray for cooler weather.

text:Wardrobe Problems: Separates	labels:Yeah, I wear dresses probably like 80-90% of the time, I think, and usually if I'm not wearing a dress then I'm wearing a skirt! For me it's just that it's easier to find dresses and skirts that fit better off the rack so they need a lot less tailoring, whereas jeans and trousers need a lot of tailoring for me and it gets expensive and time-consuming.  I have a lot of jumpers because I often wear them over a dress in autumn/winter, but otherwise my selection of tops is woefully pitiful haha. I quite like a nice lightweight camisole tucked into shorts or a skirt in summer though! But generally I don't wear a lot of separates (easier to coordinate that way too 😆).	episode_done:True

I find that going for a light and/or neutral coloured top, paired with a dark coloured (black, navy or grey) high waisted bottom has been worked for me.  It's about balance I think. Depending on your personal style, you can try a patterned, or colorful top paired with a dark coloured/neutral bottom, or vice versa. Or try monochromatic pairing, or some kind of color theme to the separates. Starting with neutrals is easier, and then maybe venturing into other color palettes, textures and patterns, depending on what you like.	episode_done:True
text:Wardrobe Problems: Separates	labels:i had this problem. i had a lot of cute pants and skirts, but like two shirts. i hated the idea of blouses (never worked a job where i needed to dress anything more than casual so it was ok), and wanted something stylish and practical.   so i got about 15 uniqlo airism long sleeved shirts for the winter in black and a pink-y color, for the summer i got about a million solid color cotton and linen deep v-neck tees from jcrew.   now i don't have to worry about my shirts anymore (which are always boring to me and i have a hard time finding ones that fit properly anyway) and i can focus on fun skirts and really loud patterned pants and my shirts will always match!  i usually pick up a couple trendy shirts each season so i'm not ONLY wearing tees, but this solution has worked really well for me.
text:This was me for the longest time. I loved skirts and jeans (I also looove cardigans), but shopping for tops just didn’t interest me. I ended up stocking up on plain tees during a big sale all in one go — also from JCrew!   Then I got a job in an office that was always warm, and without my cardigans as a “third piece”, my plain tees just didn’t cut it anymore, sigh.	labels:Yes! This is my problem. I also had stocked up on tops that need a 3rd piece. But they do not work on their own due to shape, or cut, or something else. I am not really a t-shirt as part of my outfit person, unless it is a graphic tee. And as I got bored of my cardigan, the more wrong these shirts felt.   I feel like I had the most stand alone tops during peplum wave v1.   I realize this puff sleeve moment is the time I need to stock up. The puff sleeve really works for me!
text:This is what I ended up doing! Basically “elevated” iterations of tshirts with some interesting detail — puff sleeves, peplum, etc. Also fun prints. IMO the brand Madewell does this very well, pretty much all of my “fancier” tops (really just a step up from plain tees) are from there.   Otherwise for boring tshirt days I wear a long necklace.	labels:I don't really shop at Madewell, but maybe I should look more closely.   I feel like t-shirt fit is hard for me, the shapes do not always work very well on me. My challenge is basically all my extra weight shows up below my belly button. I am pear-ish and I have a really short torso/high hips. So some tops that fit perfectly for tucking do not work untucked. And shorter tops need to be actually short, or they just look dumb because they hit in a weird place on my torso. And the shirt that fits my hips and lower waist is not a good fit on top, especially when tucking. So I ended up being super picky about the fit.   At the moment, the tops I am generally happy with are:   * 2 floral button ups * 3 striped shirts  * one cropped sweatshirt (lilac, it is new, but promising) * 2 long sleeve black blouses (but I didn't have the right bottoms, now I am a lot closer! I don't like wearing a fully black outfit so all my black bottoms were a bad fit. Now I have some patterned skirts and an olive one that should work) * 2 short sleeves silk blouses that may be a little too dressy for right now * pink peplum with balloon sleeves (sadly I got it like 2 weeks before quarantine, I envisioned it being super fun with jeans and I hadn't figured out skirts yet, but you know)  What I need are some interesting solid colored short sleeved tops that aren't black, and are in my palette colors, that can work with pants or a skirt.
text:My body type is essentially a skinny pear haha. Also have a super short torso for my height! I find Madewell’s Rhyme top and Park Popover are really great tucked, French tucked, or untucked. Madewell definitely has a muted color palette overall, so depending on your personal wardrobe that may or may not work. I’ve also had good luck with tops from Splendid. If you’re super short torso’d, you might actually want to try Petite sized tops if you haven’t already, even if you’re not technically “petite” in overall height.	labels:	episode_done:True

Also, I think a discussion on fabric grain and concepts like twill and other weaves would be helpful for people hoping to avoid clothing with mismatched grain that doesn't sit or wash right. Grain is super important to how the material behaves and it's something a lot of clothing manufacturers are sloppy about.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Throwback Thursday: Revisiting "A Primer on Materials"	labels:There’s a lot of information about which fabrics keep you warm, but not as much about which fabrics keep you cool.

text:I though this when reading, but then you could have an 'ethics' (for want of a better word) section for each fabric.

text:Throwback Thursday: Revisiting "A Primer on Materials"	labels:Hum it’s definitely an interesting read. I guess nowadays there is more emphasis on ethics and environmental cost when we choose our fabrics, so that would be an interesting add. For example cotton being so much more water hungry than hemp and linen. I was a bit thrown back by the thinsulate entry. Having spent a few years I outdoor retail, I do not really think of it as a textile, more of a insulation, and it’s certainly not the only synthetic insulation or trademark of the sort available.  Edited to add: I re-read my comment and realised it seemed a bit negative overall which is not the vibe I was going for. I think it’s tremendous work and already really helpful, so kudos to the person who wrote it in the first place :)
text:Maybe some quick pros and cons that include environmental concerns? Cotton is a big one I’m familiar with, but polyester is a petroleum product, micro fibers can shed their micro fibers during laundering, etc, etc. I’m sure there are issues with mass wool production or linen too that I’m just not aware of. It’s not really possible to not have any environmental/social impact, but a guide like that could help people make their own choices to balance some of the harms being done. (And it’s independent of brands which may or may not be making things better. Some issues are fairly universal to cotton or poly or whatever and could help guide other consumers as they try to interpret what companies are saying.)	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Unique brands/boutiques in your city?	labels:Some nice places around Europe:  * Switzerland:    * Geneva: on weekends, there's a flea market around the park near Patek Philippe Museum. I loved it especially for vintage fashion magazines and books but also clothes and jewelries.    * Lausanne, Boutique Etat d’Ame: kind of elegant garments with a twist. I love especially their shoes, they have elevated designs of classic types of shoes.    * Lausanne, MANIAK Boutique: this is a really fun and weird boutique where you'll find: some second-hand items, leather jackets and corsets, costume stuff, urban brands like Dickies and Carhartt, vintage dresses, etc. It's a really fun, quirky mess of everything. Every time I went there I bought something, it's one of my favorite shops ever.    *  Zürich: There's a nice flea market in Stadthausanlage on weekends.    *  Zürich, Fizzen: part second-hand, part regular shop, it has some nice designs similar to MANIAK in Lausanne. Also in Zürich, Barbar Vintage usually has a large selection of SH jeans and on Bleicherweg there are some more high-end vintage stores near the offices of consulting companies (what a coincidence). * France, Annecy: there is (was? maybe temporarily cancelled because of Covid-19) a quite large monthly flea market on the last Saturday of every month. I went there once especially for this and it was amazing. * Romania, Bucharest: some local boutiques are Ioana Ciolacu (designer items), Ana Urbana (shoes), Gazzelle (shoes and bags), Diana Cojocaru (unique porcelain jewelry, doesn't have a regular store but regularly hosts exhibitions around Bucharest, worth checking her Instagram account), IONA (lovely gold jewelry), Malvensky (also nice gold jewelry), Iutta (handbags and shoes with traditional motives).

text:Your thoughts on leopard print (and animal prints in general)	labels:I have similar connotations as you about them being kind of cheap or tacky looking, but would add one other angle to it. While I'm 100% against the use of real fur/exotic hides, I think part of the cheapness animal prints comes from taking something that in its natural state exists on fur and copy-pasting it onto all different kinds of fabrics. Real cheetahs look beautiful and elegant. A poorly rendered cheetah print on thin polyester leggings just looks like a terrible imitation. There isn't this mental comparison going on with other patterns, like stripes or polka dots, because there's no "real" standard to compare to. They're just decorative patterns.  Even if you attempt to create a faux fur that more closely imitates a real animal hide, it's going to look cheap and fake (to me) unless it is really well done.

I found them tacky, loud, cheap...the same connotations you had, basically. They had their moments in fashion now and then, but even when they were in fashion, I never came around to them. I think it may also partly be because someone I know growing up had a LOT of animal print in their wardrobe and house, and I became sick of it at a young age. Hatred of animal print was the one aesthetic feeling that stayed consistently with me for *years.* I was very accepting of most trends, but this is the one I could never bring myself to like – so I eventually shrugged and accepted the fact that I would always despise it.   AND THEN?????????? randomly a year ago, I suddenly found myself really liking leopard print, snakeskin, and croc skin (in small doses; I don't think I'll ever enjoy it on large pieces). They had come back into fashion, but unlike the previous times they'd cycled into fashion, this time I was suddenly feeling them? I really can't pinpoint why. It just happened. Maybe I saw some really cute outfits and ways to style it that I'd never really considered before. But either way, I bought pointy-toed leopard print pumps (with a really stunning dark golden velvet base!), leopard print slip-ons, croc skin slides, snakeskin sandals, and a snakeskin bucket bag. I thought these specific animal prints suddenly looked really cute as accessories!   So now I'm basically a-ok with leopard print, snakeskin, and croc skin. But I still really dislike zebra print for some strange reason. Not sure why this one still irritates me, and who knows, maybe one day I'll come to like this one too! But for now, zebra is a nope. And tiger print is horrendous and cheap to me.	episode_done:True
text:Your thoughts on leopard print (and animal prints in general)	labels:I have similar connotations as you about them being kind of cheap or tacky looking, but would add one other angle to it. While I'm 100% against the use of real fur/exotic hides, I think part of the cheapness animal prints comes from taking something that in its natural state exists on fur and copy-pasting it onto all different kinds of fabrics. Real cheetahs look beautiful and elegant. A poorly rendered cheetah print on thin polyester leggings just looks like a terrible imitation. There isn't this mental comparison going on with other patterns, like stripes or polka dots, because there's no "real" standard to compare to. They're just decorative patterns.  Even if you attempt to create a faux fur that more closely imitates a real animal hide, it's going to look cheap and fake (to me) unless it is really well done.

text:Your thoughts on leopard print (and animal prints in general)	labels:I don’t enjoy animal prints on myself, but I think that’s because I don’t enjoy prints in general. I tend toward solid color clothing, and then add interest with texture or hardware over pattern. The only thing I have in my closet that have any type of pattern are shoes, because I make custom sneakers for myself.   If you like leopard then rock it. I think there are a lot less stereotypes embedded with clothing these days, but maybe that’s just the area I live in right now. Especially with the popularity of 90’s trends and thrifting, I think people just like to see creative mixing and new combinations.	episode_done:True
text:Your thoughts on leopard print (and animal prints in general)	labels:I feel like leopard print is a hit or miss and depends on things like the type of fabric, the type of garment or accessory, etc. For example, a satin leopard print midi skirt can look really elegant but a leopard print jumpsuit is more questionable. Fashion and style are subjective at the end of the day but, I will say I love leopard print and dressing it up like a leopard print top with black satin wide leg pants and black pointed toe loafers. You should try on a piece just to test the waters and see if it’s for you. Also, leopard print accessories are a good way to ease into adding prints into your wardrobe.	episode_done:True

text:Changing Your Habits: Deciding to Not Shop Brands for Ethical or Other Reasons & Following Through	labels:Growing up in a small town and then moving to a bigger one, fast fashion was a whole magical thing to me. After a few years I learned more about how terrible it is and shopped there less, but that's hard to do when you're poor. I discovered thrift shopping and have been addicted to it ever since, although I realize I'm privileged in that I'm easily able to find my size at any thrift shop. Now I'm a little less poor, but still unable to afford local fashion so I keep thrifting. I support local designers when I can by going to their sample/warehouse sales and recommending them to others.   I find the hardest part to be shopping for basics. When I need a plain black tank, I go to Target because I know exactly what I'm getting.	episode_done:True
text:Changing Your Habits: Deciding to Not Shop Brands for Ethical or Other Reasons & Following Through	labels:I’m not a saint - I am great about follow through when there’s also an detriment to me or when I feel “betrayed.” For example, if a brand is marketed as “high quality” and I pay premium (but not luxury/designer) prices and am disappointed by the quality, I am able to follow through on ditching the brand very well because of the financial detriment. Similarly, if a brand is “ethical” or particularly supportive of women and minorities and it turns out to abuse its employees, I feel more betrayed than say if I buy a pair of Nikes.  I do buy some fast fashion and non-ethical fashion but I like “knowing what I’m getting” so to speak. I think it’s the false pretenses and hypocrisy of well marketed but not actually ethical/wuality etc. brands that get to me and cause me to have a lasting bad taste.  To this day though, I buy a new pair of Nikes every year or so for my runs even knowing that they aren’t great ethically because the design, function and price are perfect for me. But I also feel like Nike doesn’t pretend or charge an overboard premium	episode_done:True

text:Changing Your Habits: Deciding to Not Shop Brands for Ethical or Other Reasons & Following Through	labels:One thing I do is remind myself that whatever I want isn't usually one of a kind. This helps me with makeup buying, because I fall in love with colours and buy them and my lipstick collection is out of control. I have to keep reminding myself that whatever beautiful colour I just found out about is either a dupe of something I probably have OR if that colour isn't something I own but the brand is garbage, that other brands will definitely have that colour too.  So for fashion, if you fall in love with a bag from a brand you can't support, just remember that no bag is unique (unless it's like an awesome bag that looks like a giraffe or something). If you love Chanel flaps but refuse to buy from them, there are so many other versions. I have one by Rebecca Minkoff but luxury brands make chain flap purses too without the ickiness of supporting Coco Chanel.  I'm a knitter and weaver, so most knit and woven things I can make myself if I don't like the brand. Same with yarn, if there's a yarn company I don't support, there are millions of other yarn brands out there where I can find something similar enough.  In general, no matter what you're trying to buy, there will be other brands that make something like it. So if you must have it, you don't have to buy from the brand you hate.	episode_done:True

I also bought lounge pants from a small “ethical” (hopefully true) Kiwi brand. Both were more expensive than I usually get, but I told myself to suck it up. Buy less, buy better.	episode_done:True

Some people may still not want to even wear certain brands.... BUT it's a tiny bit like wearing fur. A great deal of people refuse to wear fur made recently but will allow exception to vintage items. If you can't live with out a certain label, maybe buying it second hand will lesson personal conflict created when buying new.

text:Changing Your Habits: Deciding to Not Shop Brands for Ethical or Other Reasons & Following Through	labels:Something I haven't seen mentioned here is clothing swaps. My friends and I are in the habit of having them at least a few times a year, and everyone walks out happy. If your friends don't do this, offer to host! We even had a Halloween costume version where we all traded outfits we no longer wanted.   Today I found success on Etsy. I was looking for tops that were ethically made, vegan, not culturally appropriative, affordable, and from a Black-owned business. I found lots of incredibly expensive brands on Google, but on Etsy I found smaller artists. So no slavery concerns (most likely), and it meets all my requirements. It only scratches the surface, but it's a place to start. It's about being intentional within the constraints.  I'm fortunate to be able to afford more expensive pieces, but wow is it hard to even know where to go. I don't shop a lot, so I really struggle with vintage and second-hand stores that only show clothing on mannequins. Before the pandemic, I never shopped online, but I also hated shopping in person because I struggled to find stores that had things I liked. It's so much easier to go into Urban or H&M or Loft. And we think of places like H&M and Forever 21 as the pinnacles of fast fashion, but I assume the worst of basically any major brand. Victoria's Secret, Gap, even luxury brands like Gucci or Prada, I assume they cut as many corners as possible.   Trying to find clothes within all my constraints helped me discover some amazing pieces that I am so excited to buy. They're incredible statement pieces that I never would have found without being more intentional in my purchases.	episode_done:True
text:Changing Your Habits: Deciding to Not Shop Brands for Ethical or Other Reasons & Following Through	labels:I've completely stopped buying from Amazon and actually feel ill when I see anyone buying from them - which is everyone I know except my husband. Even people who are verbal about how shitty of a company it is still can't resist the "convenience." I think it takes practice. The longer you abstain from certain things, the less you want to go back.   I've also been a lot more conscious of the companies I buy my clothes from. If it seems too good to be true (i.e. cheap,) then it probably is. A beautiful top listed for $10 might seem like a deal, but you have to really think about why that garment is so cheap in the first place. I've gotten to the point where I can push past being seduced by a low price and look into the company itself. I read about their business practices, and if they seem fishy, I don't buy.  I'd rather thrift my clothes and feel more confident that I'm not buying in to fast-fashion. I'd be content wearing the same clothes forever and just reworking them through the years with my own hands, as opposed to buying from a company that treats people and our environment badly.	episode_done:True

I don't think I would describe that outfit as "restrained" as much as "unique pieces but overall subscribes to the formula of a very normal outfit" in the sense that a dress with socks, a bag, and loafers isn't weird.

text:Formula for a put together outfit that works for most aesthetics	labels:I don't use this sort of rule, but to plays into my choices indirectly. For example, I am semi-maximalist.

Same for shoes they are generally one color, something neutral. They can have details with a little bit of texture, but I can't do a multi colored show with embellishments. It would be too much with one of my patterned items.

If I'd put 7 more "points" worth of accessorizes and stuff that would turn me into overly feminine very much in your face type of appearance. So I usually have my outfit - fairly simple but fitting, some makeup on the face, and everything else is a bit toned down, e.g. simple jewellery, maybe a pendant or earrings, simple hairdo, etc. If I had less prominent features, the "blank slate" model look I feel I could push further with adding scarves, bags, more jewellery, etc. But being curvy even red lips become kind of a provocation.	episode_done:True

Fashion from that approach seems to be more about price and posturing than the sort of things that interest me—cut, color, silhouette, textures, prints, all these aesthetic considerations are largely absent from male fashion.

The day I purchased my bland 'work wardrobe' of elasticated trousers and black jumpers I felt incredibly sad. I understand that I have a new role now but I just feel unattractive and basic in all the wrong ways.	episode_done:True

I never wish to be pigeon holed and one way I can help avoid such seems to never be notable in the same way - some days I have fashion forward eccenteic wear, other days it business formal with expensive jewelry, other days its "thot" fashion with big hoops and short shirts. There's power in not being predictable and if Im going to be judged regardless, I want to make it hard for them.	episode_done:True

You may find someone with a similar body type... but there's no guarantee it'll be great help. Especially if they're the instagram baddie type and you like actually have to go to work and can't just wear bralettes as tops every day (this is usually my issue)  I would like to see a lot more size 6-8-10 people modeling clothes in general. Or see the target market of a brand modeling those clothes. If a brand skews older, show older people, not just skinny 40 y/os with dyed hair and barely any fine lines (looking at you L.L. Bean/Lands End)  On their website, places like Madewell usually have a 'standard size' (usually below size 4) model and a 'plus size' model (like size 14/16). It should be helpful to have the range of images but it kind of falls flat for me being right in the middle. It'd be nice to see even just a size 6/8 as a more 'standard size. '	episode_done:True

text:Maybe because my feed is a lot of plus size/fat bodies, but I find this type of thinking terribly depressing. I won't pretend that terms like "effortless" are meant for us, but it also can feel even more exclusionary in a way when I see other fat people being like "never will I be considered to look this good!! no matter the effort I put in!!!".	labels:I think the point is just that the idea of "effortless" is completely void and that's best demonstrated through the fact that it crumbles completely when applied to a fat body. It's not the body, it's the concept.  Because it's not *actually* about the clothes, or about the attitude, or about any of that. It's literally just the thin, desirable body.  You can put sweatpants on it and call it "athleisure", you can wrap it in clingfilm and call it "sexy", or you can drape a burlap sack on it and call it "high fashion", but that's just people projecting bullshit concepts on a desirable body.   None of these things seem to exist or stand on their own, *unless* they're on a thin, conventionally "hot" body. When sweatpants are on Kendall, it's "athleisure". When they're on my lumpy thighs, they're just sloppy. When Glossier "makeup" is on a 17 year old model is cool and "effortless", when it's on an uggo, it's just...uggo.   It's not at all about the plus size bodies being somehow less than. Plus size bodies are not the problem. These meaningless concepts are the problem and it's in no way a negative reflection on the bodies, when the concept disintegrates on them.	episode_done:True

text:How do ya'll express your culture or traditional fashion in modern clothing?	labels:I’m Vietnamese, and I’ve only recently been interested in my cultural clothing because of - well, internalized racism, which wasn’t great, LOL. But what I’ve done is save up for custom áo dài!  Traditionally, áo dài is pretty eye-catching, especially in the U.S. (where I live). I’m saving up to create tailor-made áo dài that’s more modern and something understated I could wear often: for example, switching out white silk pants for black ones, and the main dress for a crushed navy velvet. I find that modernizing cultural clothing can be a way to represent your cultural and ethnic roots without feeling strange or like an impostor, and seeing the same, familiar cuts in different prints and tones that I like fills me with a whole new type of joy.  I also follow other people who wear modernized cultural clothing. The first example that comes to mind is @asunnydisposish on Twitter, who is an artist but often posts pictures of her putfits (modernized hanbok). I have an album of Vietnamese clothing outside of áo dài (like áo nhật bình) and other designers’ takes on modern áo dài, and another album of textures, prints, and fabrics I would kill to wear.   Other ways you can incorporate this into your clothing is supporting artists and designers from whatever ethnic group/culture you belong to!  If anyone’s interested in seeing the albums, I’m more than willing to share; I just don’t know how to operate imgur yet, which seems to be the go-to for everyone here. I hope this helped! Best of luck!
text:Those are good tips!  I've been looking at getting a custom qi pao myself (grandmother is chinese), but I've never had custom clothing. I guess there are always tailors around so I shouldn't worry too much about it!   I hadn't thought about local artists. I'll have to look it up. I meet so few laotian people outside of my family (as in never) that I hadn't considered reaching out or looking for them.   And yeah, I'd be happy to look at an album!	labels:	episode_done:True

You might catch yourself setting certain outfits aside, and those are key moments to train yourself to look out for. When you find yourself doing it, make a choice. Some days you may simply wish to be comfortable, no shame. But it may also be important to recognize it makes you feel uncomfortable for now, and then do it anyway.

My mom always makes comments on my clothes at home - both good and bad. It makes me insanely self-conscious, but one of the things that helps the most is compromising with myself. Like if I want to wear a pair of pants that I'm not sure how my family will think of, I'll try to pair it with a shirt that I know I won't feel self-conscious in and that my family/friends won't think is too out there. Call it a variation on the whole little shirt/big pants formula - unknown shirt/known pants, or known shirt/unknown pants. I know this isn't a perfect solution but it really helped me ease into things back home. Eventually, all your clothes will be known quantities and you'll be able to start dressing how you like almost all the time. :)	episode_done:True

Tips?	labels:I eventually transitioned from wearing men's band shirts every single day (seriously I had like 30) to feminine clothing (age 17-19). Generally, I didn't even bother bringing it up to my family and they never commented on it. That said, I still felt totally embarrassed going from tom boy to standard women's clothing.  I'd say if they aren't commenting on it, just do you. If they start acting weird, try opening up a dialogue with them as to why they're having a reaction to your clothing. But it's very normal for people to change styles, especially at your age. Even if they do care, just dress in whatever makes you happy and they'll likely drop it. You'll feel uncomfortable but it's easier over time.	episode_done:True
text:Feeling self-conscious with changing style around family - anyone relate? Tips?	labels:My family always comments on what I wear if it’s not super casual. My dad will comment if it’s revealing and my mom will comment if it’s fancier than the occasion calls for. And usually this will be done with a sarcastic question like “where are you going?” or similar when obviously I am not going anywhere because we are quarantined, and heaven forbid I decide to put on a nice outfit to boost my mood. I’m lucky that my family is at least a real-pants-in-quarantine family. If I couldn’t even wear jeans without getting a comment, I’d be sad.	episode_done:True
text:Feeling self-conscious with changing style around family - anyone relate? Tips?	labels:After a few times seeing you with your new style your family will get used to it. You might face some comments at first – trust me, I know about family members who just HAVE to comment on every little change. But once you get past the first few initial comments it'll become the norm for them.	episode_done:True
text:Feeling self-conscious with changing style around family - anyone relate? Tips?	labels:This was me around your age (or about 15-21).  My parents (and all of my relatives) expected me to dress super preppy (like a walking J. Crew catalog-- those were a thing then).  I was secretly alternative and was more about band tees and late 90s era Hot Topic stuff.  But I had very few Hot Topic type things because of my parents.   I remember putting black lipstick on as soon as I got to school and taking it off before I went home.  I hid the lipstick in my locker.    They still give me a hard time about how I dress and I simply reply with "I'm not you.  If you want to see your perfect child, go see \[sister's name\]" (my sister is a clone of my mom in almost every way, shape, and form).	episode_done:True
text:Is anyone else intimidated by maximalism? I love it, but how do you do it?	labels:My only problem is these are the kind of outfits I wear once and then don’t know how to incorporate with other pieces in my wardrobe. If this was my everyday style I guess I wouldn’t have that problem, but I don’t dress like this every day.	episode_done:True

text:Is anyone else intimidated by maximalism? I love it, but how do you do it?	labels:Based on that album, I guess I am maximal about half of the time! :D  I think the easiest thing to do is to start small.  If you wear a lot of solids and neutrals - dip your toe in with a great coat. A coat in a fun color, maybe even a patterned coat. Wear that daily.  If you don't want to commit to a coat, get one "loud" patterned item. The easiest way to pair it is to pull out one of the colors in the pattern and that is what you wear it with. Instead of using the neutral, use one of the accent colors.  And number 3 is color blocking. That one is super easy. You just pick two solids, but skip the neutrals. Tone on tone is fun, as well as things that are near opposites on the color wheel.  I have yet to master pattern mixing, that is one of my goals.	episode_done:True
text:Is anyone else intimidated by maximalism? I love it, but how do you do it?	labels:I wouldn't call myself a maximalist, but style theory is similar to any other artistic theory. When choosing how to combine pieces, always take into account the color, lines, patterns, and textures. From here, the aesthetic is completely up to the individual. For example, a maximalist may work within a certain color pallette and then intentionally incorporate a clashing accent. Pattern mixing might seem random, but the person may have taken into account the contrast between sharp lines and abstract patters. So I guess my answer is somewhere in the middle. It always takes A LOT of effort to make something look effortless. However once there are certain boundaries, it can feel effortless to put colors, patterns, and silhouettes together that make sense to the individual and are theoretically pleasing to the eye.
text:It’s very similar to the MCM movement and the rams study homes in that sense. You don’t expect it, but it works.   I dress a lot like the photos OP provided and I don’t find most of them especially eccentric?	labels:I agree, the photos are pretty tame. I can see where for the average person pairing that many different colors together and including big statement pieces could be intimidating, but generally the color palettes are straight forward. Pattern including pink, yellow, and orange on the dress, orange coat, pink shoes, etc. I think it's just using more colors where some would choose a neutral. And pairing a very dramatic silhouette with more subdued pieces.	episode_done:True
text:Is anyone else intimidated by maximalism? I love it, but how do you do it?	labels:These examples are brightly colored, textured, or patterned, Maybe it would help to imagine n e these in neutrals, to see how wearable they are?

text:Is anyone else intimidated by maximalism? I love it, but how do you do it?	labels:I think I'm in between here. Not minimalist, but not maximalist. The one maximalist thing I'll do is with either accessories (scarf and jewelry and a hat and funky boots) or one bright/bold piece like a colorful jacket. Like, I have a mustard, navy and pink paisley jacket that I'll wear with jeans and a navy top, but I don't really have the stones to wear pink shoes and a green hat *also*.  Maybe try this on a smaller scale instead of attempting a full-on look?	episode_done:True
text:Is anyone else intimidated by maximalism? I love it, but how do you do it?	labels:I'm a maximalist with a lower case m. I love prints, colors, textures, and patterns! I don't push the envelope as much compared to these photographs. Maybe one day? These are gold medal swimmers, I'm still at the doggie paddle stage. But I also love having a lot of options, I'm the exact opposite of a capsule wardrobe.	episode_done:True
text:Dae get overwhelmed by fashion?	labels:What made a HUGE difference for me was slowly starting to separate what I thought was cute and trendy, and what was actually realistic for me. Like a lot of others I started with lots of pinterest browsing. I made two separate boards, one for a "capsule" wardrobe and one for a "wow thats cute". The capsule is in a color pallet that I like and fits my lifestyle (darks,neutrals, a few colors that look good on me and I'm comfortable wearing), where as the other cute board is just things I enjoy on others. There's TONS of styles out there that I adore, and might one day adopt parts of, but just because I aesthetically love and appreciate it doesn't mean it'll work for me and my lifestyle. For example, I love the super feminine, flowy light vibe. Its beautiful, looks amazing on other people, but on me it feels out of place and isn't a very good fit for me specifically. This goes on the cute board! I know I love it and can identify that now, while still realizing that its just not for me right now.   Visually splitting up /why/ I liked a look or outfit really helped me better understand what I was looking for in my own wardrobe. Maybe that could be a good starting place for you too!	episode_done:True
text:Dae get overwhelmed by fashion?	labels:I actually find most people are in the same boat as you, so I wouldn't worry too much.  It does take a lot of time and effort and money to keep up with fashion.  It helps to think of it as a hobby; and people who are really put together generally go about it with the zeal of, say, a stamp collector and stamps.  Just like how some people are basketball enthusiasts and others are gardening enthusiasts, there's really no reason you have to be into fashion.  I find that there's this really pervasive expectation that women all ought to naturally love clothes and fashion; and any failure to invest in that interest is a failure in some biological sensibility.     If you find yourself struggling, then I really do recommend getting a stylist or tailor or ideally both.  The stylist will push you to try things outside your comfort, the tailor will help you with fit issues, and having both can really be transformative in a very quick and immediate way.  But in terms of continuing your education or interest--that really depends on whether you want to make this a bit of a hobby.  It does take time and effort and money, after all.  And if you don't naturally find yourself interested; well, there's no sense in forcing yourself just in the name of "fitting in" to some perceived societal norm.       I assure you, from Paris to Shanghai, there are plenty of women who would rather learn the nuances of cement than spend any time pondering the fit of a pair of trousers; and there's nothing wrong with that.	episode_done:True
text:Dae get overwhelmed by fashion?	labels:Hmm....I think when it comes to feeling like you don’t fit in fashion wise, it’s helpful to realize people aren’t as aware of the details and flaws as you are, and most people probably think you look fine, or more normal than you would think. Besides that, experimenting with different cuts of clothing can be really helpful in getting started. For example, if you’ve been mostly wearing skinny jeans, you can try some more straight legged jeans with rolled cuffs and see how that looks. If you mostly wear tshirts, try tshirts in different cuts, or look for an outfit with a T-shirt on Tiktok or instagram, look for the details you like, then look for a T-shirt with similar details. Getting into fashion and finding a style involves experimenting, and starting with small changes with basics you’re already comfortable in might help with making fashion feel more natural.	episode_done:True
text:Dae get overwhelmed by fashion?	labels:Echoing some other comments: only follow instagram accounts that inspire you and make you feel good. Let go of the social media comparison game. Follow accounts from people of all different shapes, sizes, and ethnicities while you're at it.  I am not a fashion icon, but my one piece of advice to avoid being overwhelmed is to focus on one single clothing item or accessory you'd like to improve, and pair it with easy basics. For example, I wanted to improve my sneaker game a few years ago. I bought (over time) a few pairs of sneakers I LOVED and paired them with my basic black tee shirts/jeans. It was so much easier to focus on wearing cool and fun sneakers without feeling like I needed to overhaul my entire closet. Another example: I figured out how to do my hair one particular style that I really like. No matter what outfit I'm in, my hair makes me feel cute when I style it that way.   You don't have to do all the fashion at one time. Everyday fashion is not a contest, I promise. You have your whole life to learn what you like and lean into your personal style.	episode_done:True
text:Dae get overwhelmed by fashion?	labels:This is probably an unpopular opinion here since a lot of the ffa users think fashion is a manual that you have to study, but if you don't like colours? Don't wear em. Don't like jewelry or makeup? Don't wear em. It's just body covers- do what makes you feel good. Not everyone was made to be a timeless, effortless fashionista. We don't all need to look like an off duty Instagram influencer and shouldn't have to dress a certain way because someone on the Internet said it was 'right.	episode_done:True
text:Dae get overwhelmed by fashion?	labels:I feel that a lot of how to be fashion forward comes down to confidence and fit. You should never feel pressured into wear something you feel uncomfortable in. Sometimes having well-fitted T-shirt and jeans can make you look put together.  With colour, I find that you have to find the right colour that suits your skin tone. And tat involves a lot of trying on different colours at the shops. I used to hate wearing colour until I found the right shade of warm fuschia that really made my skin glow. Since then I've tried on loads of different colours and find that loud warm colours tend to suit my skin tone. I usually wear the bright colours on the tops and wear neutral bottoms (black, navy, grey etc.) so I don't have to think about matching colours.	episode_done:True
text:Dae get overwhelmed by fashion?	labels:Often all it takes to look put together is a good shoe. My daughter in her mid twenties spends very little time or money on clothes. She likes to wear whatever falls into her life (mostly friend’s castoffs); but she wears them with a nice pair of oxfords and a fun and eye-catching pair of socks and she looks great.	episode_done:True
text:Dae get overwhelmed by fashion?	labels:I promise, the effortless look takes SO MUCH effort.  I hear you though. Sometimes I feel myself getting stuck and I go through periods where I suddenly hate everything in my closet. I don’t think I ever established an actual style for myself. My tastes are so eclectic! Sometimes I like preppier, menswear-type pieces. Other times I’m into the ultra-feminine, curvy femme fatale schtick, sometimes I’m more boho/folksy, other times I’m a bit vintage/classic, and then sometimes modern and edgy. I can’t decide which style is mine!

text:Dae get overwhelmed by fashion?	labels:Boy does this hit close to home.  Personally, I have found that you tube videos help me.  Not so much for inspiration--like you said, but for teaching me about what does go together and for tutorials.  Perhaps you need something more tutorial-like than inspiration?	episode_done:True
text:Dae get overwhelmed by fashion?	labels:I think there are some great posts on here, just wanted to add, if you're just starting to build a wardrobe that feels "you" dont feel like you have to go out and buy it all at once.  Same goes with jewelry. Rather than trying to find a bunch of pieces you kind of like, find one or two pieces you love and make them signature, featured pieces in your wardrobe.	episode_done:True
text:Indoor layers	labels:I hang up my coat when I’m inside. Is that what you were asking?	episode_done:True
text:Indoor layers	labels:It is generally considered polite to take off and hang out outwear garnents when you are indoors. You will get weord looks if you take off a coat and have another, slightly lighter, coat underneath like a very warm matryoshka doll.
text:I think ‘very warm matryoshka doll’ may be my style goal for this winter. Layers, colour, embroidery, maybe a little fur...  :)	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Indoor layers	labels:For clarity, because I think I get where you’re coming from—are you saying that the outerwear makes the outfit complete, so you’re wondering what people do to complete their look after they’ve taken off the coat once indoors? I’ve often felt like this while scrolling through Pinterest and wondered the same.
text:That's how I interpreted the question as well.  The "third piece" rule pretty much would have you to put a third piece on top, and in winter, that third piece is a coat, and once you are inside you don't wear the coat anymore.  For me, I typically have an indoor third piece waiting for me, ie a neutral color cardigan at my desk, so when I take off my kickass outerwear I can still complete the look with a third piece for indoors.  If that's not possible for whatever reason I'll wear the indoor third piece under the outdoor third piece because if it's cold enough to wear the winder coat, a thin cardigan isn't going to seriously mess up the temperature calculus.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Yeah that's what I took out of this as well.  A lot of those inspo posts on Pinterest are Pepe at fashion weeks and they're notoriously under or overdressed for the weather because they want to have the look. I have so many saved of cold NY fashion weeks and people in mini dresses and open toed shoes. AFAIK they're just running from their car to the paps and then inside again or suffering through it otherwise.	labels:	episode_done:True
text:Indoor layers	labels:I think what your serious outerwear is going to be depends on where you live. I live somewhere where the cute wool coats you may see in winter NYC or winter London are not practical. People where I live wear huge down feather coats in the winter, and we are definitely not wearing these coats inside. By extension, autumn is pretty brutal and people may break out their heavy jackets that are double-lined, but again, we’re not wearing these indoors. Since my area is super frigid, we’re not looking at outerwear trends to be cute. People who move here realize that they need multiple coats and jackets, and it’s to be practical and cover the variety of weather changes more than anything.  If I moved somewhere warmer, and didn’t need outerwear for the practicality reason, I would say that I actually love blazers and think they’re fine indoors (because you see blazers in corporate suiting, which is worn indoors). Your mileage may vary though, cause if somebody is wearing trenchcoats and leather jackets indoors, I would question if that individual is looking to leave the building.	episode_done:True
text:Indoor layers	labels:To be honest, I think this depends on your day to day activities. For me I work out of an office, my car, and since February, my house. If I am on an in the office day I wear something I don't mind leaving over my chair. It's trickier when I have appointments in other offices, and so on. If I'm only walking a short distance I leave my outer layers in the trunk of my car and tough it out.   I am in a northern (Canadian) climate for the record.	episode_done:True
text:Indoor layers	labels:I have these thoughts almost every Fall. My inspiration Pinterest boards are filled with photos typically taken outside with individuals wearing amazing outerwear. Last year, I bought a camel coat (faux wool, because I couldn’t invest until I knew if I REALLY liked the look). I loved the look with the coat and I was so sad and torn to remove once indoors. So I guess that’s the TL;DR, I remove my outerwear indoors. Unless I’m quickly stopping in somewhere. But it was always a bummer to do because I love the look.  Aside from outerwear, I try to achieve other interesting layers in the form of either mid length structured cardigans, chunky scarves, slightly oversized tunics with tight sleeves (Free People-Esque), and/or bomber jackets that I’m comfortable leaving on indoors.	episode_done:True
text:Indoor layers	labels:This was so weird to me when I moved to somewhere cold also because I hated being noisy with the inner layer of puffers/vests and it was so hot in some rooms and frigid in others! I only wore my giant wool turtlenecks on the west coast where people don’t turn on the heat that much vs having to wear tshirts underneath the giant parka cuz the heater would be oppressive on the East. Sorry I don’t think I helped but I understand your confusion!	episode_done:True
text:Indoor layers	labels:I think it depends on the garment. Winter coats get taken off always, but light, blazer-esque layers and denim jackets transition indoors just fine. I think my rough heuristic is whether I’d wear the jacket fully zipped/buttoned for warmth. If yes, it comes off inside.	episode_done:True

More of a "I'm here, and you'll just have to deal with it" from the previous of almot saying "sorry" for simply being in the same room as someone else due to me thinking it was the polite thing to do. What bs that was, I can see it now. So yeah, thank you Docs for giving me that push for discovering and acknowledging my own self-worth.	episode_done:True
text:How do you challenge yourself?	labels:Not exactly what you're looking for but I've challenged myself to only buy thrifted, vintage, secondhand or bartered since the start of 2020. I've allowed myself to buy new if I cannot find the item on any of those sources.   This means I have to try really hard to make out of style items look in style haha. I'm lucky to live in a large city though, and there is a bartering app that is really widely used here.	episode_done:True

I’m also really into wider leg pants and denim jackets, so I plan to wear more of those	episode_done:True

So now, when I have that itch, I just add everything to my shopping cart and then close the tab and go to bed.	episode_done:True

text:What materials are worth paying more for? What equals quality?	labels:The people in the comments on this thread are kind of... The OP is asking how looking at a garnment in a website, how you can gauge if it has quality.  The majority of websites don't list anything other than fabric composition and have a page on the company's ethics, which is likely filled with lies (EVERLANE, which many "ethics' conscious people were duped with bought)). Also, expecting the majority of people to research on said ethics, when most don't even read that ethics' page is being out of touch with reality.  This person is making an effort than the majority of people don't do. To which some respond with condescending remarks?	episode_done:True
text:What materials are worth paying more for? What equals quality?	labels:It's pretty hard to discern quality online, which is why I generally avoid online shopping for clothes. But I know that's not helpful advice, especially right now, lol. When I do buy clothes online, I make it a point to look at the reviews. If they're allowed to post photos, you get a better idea of what the item really looks like. Keep an eye out for common issues, are there multiple reviews complaining about the fabric being sheer, or the stitching being flimsy?	episode_done:True
text:What materials are worth paying more for? What equals quality?	labels:I will pay more for 100% cotton, linen, wool, cashmere and silk.  I will not pay more for anything else in 100% material including denim (uncomfortable), modal, tencel etc. I pay less for mixes, especially if it’s natural mixed with artificial, that seems to lead to pilling.  As for quality, the best way to tell is to literally feel it. It’s hard to describe but if you go to the most expensive (especially men’s clothes and minimalism/ethical focused) boutiques you can find and feel their fabrics, you will develop a touch for it. The material is almost always denser, heavier, and thicker than you are used to. That’s not to say $$$$ equals quality - but IMO it’s the best way to “learn by feel” is to find a large concentration of it. Quality is sometimes super affordable but relatively rare - for example, Hanes “ultra weight” t-shirts are some of the best quality 100% cotton tees you can buy and is very cheap (but also no design/super basic).  When I go into a new store - I don’t even pull out items on “sight”, I pull them out by feel, remember the brands that feel good and then see what else they have.  For online shopping, I stick to the same brands over and over. My favorite t-shirts, tanks and other simple tops for example are from Hanes, Wol Hide, Le Bon Shoppe, The Great, Tela9, Lilla P, and Sunspel. How do I know? I’ve felt them in person, bought them, worn and washed them, and when I need a new item, I go there first.	episode_done:True

text:What materials are worth paying more for? What equals quality?	labels:See if the people will send you higher quality pictures before they send it off.  Some things that are really impacted by quality are: Shoe glue/soles, leather, coat lining, anything with wool or raw/natural fibers, hardware like zippers, detailing, straps.  Construction/craftsmanship is king/queen, bad/lack of stitching, thin liners, stiff scratchy wool, etc will make or break something. Look for brands or websites that give you macro shots of the stitching, seams, material, that way you can make an informed decision.  Many sellers will be willing to send you pictures if they think it will net them a sale.	episode_done:True

text:What materials are worth paying more for? What equals quality?	labels:Linen, silk, hemp, organic cotton, wool, cashmere. Natural is always better, generally speaking (excluding rayon/bamboo which is a natural derived synthetic, but including tencell which is eucalyptus.) And construction matters too, as does fabric weave. It’s so hard to judge quality online! I usually judge by touch and fabric hand and stitching quality. I have a degree in fashion design though so touch is the easiest way for me to identify a fabric! Personally I avoid nylon or polyester and consider it cheap. It is rarely high quality unless it is a high performance weave or treated, and even then it gets stinky easily. I only wear it for technical outdoor gear, like for hiking or swimming, for everyday wear, natural is always worth paying more!	episode_done:True

text:Sizing relationships between brands	labels:Some websites (department stores, ASOS) have a true fit tool where you put in your measurements, body type, and well fitting item of clothing and that information is used to recommend sizing.   It’s also a good idea to know your measurements in general if you’re buying secondhand as many sellers will list the measurements of the garment.  But overall sizing can be so wild within one brand, much less across multiple that I dint think there’s much of a rule of thumb.

I have a very rectangular body, bog shoulders and chest and am 5’9” and get most of my clothing from them. As others have said, great return policy but the videos of the models wearing the clothes is the best bit. You see them move and how long they are.

text:Sizing relationships between brands	labels:Great advice so far, another thing to take into consideration is fabric type. For example pants in a cotton and spandex blend are going to be more forgiving, fit-wise, than 100% cotton. So for example I could wear skinny jeans in size 30 if they had spandex/elastene in the fabric, where the same brand and size in 100% cotton denim might not get past my hips.	episode_done:True

text:Sizing relationships between brands	labels:Poshmark might work well for you once you find your ideal clothing measurements. Good sellers will either list measurements in the listing, or will gladly measure the clothing for you if you ask. This is awesome because you are getting the measurements of the EXACT item of clothing.   If you find a piece of clothing that fits well, you can use that as a baseline measurement for similar styles. For example, if I have some dresses that are a perfect length, or shorts that fit perfect in the hips, etc, I’ll search for similar brands or shapes and try to match the size and measurements of the item I have at home.	episode_done:True

text:Sizing relationships between brands	labels:Some websites (department stores, ASOS) have a true fit tool where you put in your measurements, body type, and well fitting item of clothing and that information is used to recommend sizing.   It’s also a good idea to know your measurements in general if you’re buying secondhand as many sellers will list the measurements of the garment.  But overall sizing can be so wild within one brand, much less across multiple that I dint think there’s much of a rule of thumb.
text:I second this! I made a note in my phone with all of my measurements and it's saved me a lot of time and money. Before I buy anything I compare my measurements with the websites size guide (I do it for each individual item) and select whatever size *they* have listed for my measurements.   These are measurements I keep personally:  Height Bust Band Waits Hips Hollow to Hemlines  Hollow to floor  Inseam:   For some of these (mainly bottoms) I jotted down my true measurements using a tape measurer and also took measurements of jeans that I already had that fit well.	labels:I did that too, but I don't have all of these.

Old man slacks have fun silhouettes, I recently found a pair of khaki grandpa shorts that I love. Also large, cropped, thick fabric T-shirts hold their structure on my frame pretty well and I french tuck a lot of of my shirts.

text:Lower quality items during Nordstrom Anniversary Sale?	labels:There are a few brands that do this (Vince and Theory are the ones I've encountered...). Back when I worked in a more formal industry I was shopping for a Theory suit. At Nordstrom Rack the suit was unlined and a wool/poly blend. At Nordstrom the suit was wool with a poly half-lining. And at the Theory flagship in NYC the suit was pure wool with some natural or cellulose full lining (it's been a few years... but it definitely wasn't poly). This was ostensibly the same suit - similar silhouette and the same name, just a few numbers on the product ID differed. And of course the fit when I tried them on was noticeably different, from the Rack one being like a very cheap imitation, the Nordstrom one being pretty good, and the flagship one fitting like a glove.   Similarly, I recently bought some AllSaints moto boots from 6pm fully expecting them to be a diluted version. Instead they were the same cow leather lined with goat leather I tried in store. Considering how these things usually go, a happy surprise (no way in hell are they worth the $450 at full price). Side note: 6pm secretly lists most of their stock on Amazon with Prime fulfillment, which is great because their return policy sucks.
text:I’ve definitely learned to check material content on the designer/non-house brands. Occasionally Nordstrom returns end up at the Rack outside of the normal sales cycle for the item and are a good deal. But you’re right- a lot more polyester than silk, etc for most of the items there	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Lower quality items during Nordstrom Anniversary Sale?	labels:I realized this during black friday sales a few years ago.  I think all retailers do it.  Brands create special products for "X Retailer Only" with a discounted price which is really just a lower quality item but passed off to the customer as if it's a great deal.  I'm done with big sales.

text:Lower quality items during Nordstrom Anniversary Sale?	labels:Zella is a one of Nordstrom’s private label brands that they develop themselves; the Live in Legging (which I’m guessing is the legging you know and love) is a replenishment item that they continually carry inventory of year round and increase their purchasing quantities to support the increase in demand going into the NSale, meaning that you’ll find a mix of inventory that was in their network before the sale started and inventory that flowed in to support the sale. Usually with replenishment items you’re not likely to see a shift in quality or production since the sale is a long planned for event and margin is built in across the year to support the promotion during the sale. Special items that are just purchased for the sale, or for any off price retailer, then yes - absolutely, you’re likely to be getting a lower quality product since buyers and vendors have margin targets they still need to protect so they need to make compromises somewhere when they’re planning to sell the bulk of the units at a discount.	episode_done:True
text:Lower quality items during Nordstrom Anniversary Sale?	labels:I make clothing and sell it. Lead time on some fabric I wanted is 5 months because factories in China closed down and are behind and are now staffing with fewer employees. 3 months to produce and 2 months on a boat.  They may just be using different fabrics because of that. I will prob need to substitute.	episode_done:True

text:Lower quality items during Nordstrom Anniversary Sale?	labels:It helps to look if the item is on sale anywhere else/if any other retailer is price matching. It’s less likely to be “made for the Nordstrom anniversary sale specifically” if you can find it elsewhere!

I have a lot of art and vintage stuff I love to death, but when it comes down to it I can't take it.  I am one of four people who would have to go in the same car, so I can't take too much. Here's my inventory. Nothing for work because if I have to leave my house my work is closed down too.   Clothing: seven pairs of socks, seven pairs of underpants, a comfy bra, a set of pj's (flannel shorts and nostalgic t-shirt), a cute comfy sweater, a pair of jeans, a pair of Adidas superstar shoes, a pair of bamboo leggings with pockets, two tank tops, 2 t-shirts, a flannel button up, and a rain jacket  Self care: inhaler, Advil, toothbrush , toothpaste, deodorant, face wash, face moisturizer, setting powder, fave eyeshadow pallet, waterproof eyeliner, waterproof mascara, lip tint, brow gel, hair brush, and fave scrunchie    Other: small box of photos, external hard rive, laptop, phone charger, box of important papers, cat carrier, cat kibble, cat blanket,cat treats, cat brush, box of valuable jewelry, favourite childhood doll  *edit: for those concerned, cat is not listed as packed because Winston does not enjoy being in his crate.	episode_done:True

I was so light headed from smoke inhalation that I didn’t even remember to pack any underwear, so I’m just really really hoping the house doesn’t burn down because I packed 4 shirts, 4 pairs of pants, and 1 pair of shoes, and if all my silk blazers burn I’m going to cry	episode_done:True
text:As I wait to hear if I have to evacuate due to CA wildfires, here’s a hypothetical I had to do: you have time to prepare before your evacuation and pack up your car. What clothes do you bring and why?	labels:Last year, we had to evacuate in the middle of the night with almost no notice. I was in charge of the basic necessities and while I had plenty of clothes and things for my son (5mo at the time), I just randomly grabbed an armful of clothes from the closet for my husband and I, and for some reason the entire contents of my husband’s sock drawer. I forgot to bring him any pants, but I brought every sock he owns. 🤦🏼‍♀️ So... it’s a great exercise to think of all this before you have to evacuate lol (ETA: also in CA, we couldn’t go home for a few days but our house and our stuff were thankfully fine)	episode_done:True
text:As I wait to hear if I have to evacuate due to CA wildfires, here’s a hypothetical I had to do: you have time to prepare before your evacuation and pack up your car. What clothes do you bring and why?	labels:sneakers, tons of undies, and lots of socks, bra  Every spring I pack a "basement bag". In case we have a tornado and have to go to the basement for shelter and our house gets obliterated I want a bag of essentials so we can be mildly clean. I mainly focus on underclothes and always a pair of sneakers. The idea of navigating a disaster in flip flops or anything but sneakers sounds awful to me. I try and throw clothes in that can be worn in public or around the house, so nothing too ratty. I'd also suggest a pair of work gloves in case you have to handle anything. I guess I'm not sure how life works during a fire disaster. Is it like a  tornado where if you get flattened then you're focusing on clean up? What about work? If you have work clothes consider packing an outfit or two in case you have to go into work. I'm sorry you have this stress to deal with, how scary it all must be.

That is irreplaceable and even though I only wear it to special football games I would cry over that jacket more than any other item. Her brown faux fur coat would be next. My "sentimental/valuable" jewelry collection (I'd pawn it if I had to), my black gypsy skirt that looks like moths have eaten the bottom from it snagging on things (it's survived me for 10 years, I ain't giving up on her yet), my made-in-Ireland hand-knit emerald green wool sweater, this ridiculously comfortable yet loud romper that I'm conveniently already wearing, my purple shawl, my lucky Lucky jeans, my space boot Doc Martens and my snow leopard Spirit Hood.  It's a weird list that doesn't seem to go together, but that's what comes to mind first. I've kept these items for years despite all my style changes and wardrobe rehauls. I could (and probably will) replace everything else eventually.  I hope you and your house stays safe - I'm in Cali too, gratefully far enough to not worry about having to evacuate but close enough to watch the ash falling like snow.

And I noticed when traveling for work how much more conservatively people tend to dress in my current city versus in other parts of the country, even in the more hip/young/alternative parts of town.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:This is such a good point, I moved from a poor city in the Southwest United States to Montréal. This city is so European and it’s fashion reflects that- women look more put together while still being casual. My city before this was about 10 years behind in fashion, so Hollister mixed with ~country~ was how most people dressed. There’s also so much more variety here- I feel like I can experiment a lot more with what fits me and what doesn’t. But like u/Pitta_ said, if I ever move somewhere with totally different tastes like the West coast I think I would adapt my style to fit that a little more.	labels:	episode_done:True

text:Is 2020 the year of the 'house dress?' On comfort as a 'trend'.	labels:This style was trending waaaay before the pandemic in the slow fashion world. Oversized prairie dresses, loose billowy tops, elastic waist wide leg linen pants, dresses that resemble paper sacks, etc. I always wanted to try some of these styles but at work I mostly wore fitted and the more traditionally feminine  business causal clothing. To me a lot of the slow fashion stuff looked comfortable but not something I could pull off in the office and I always had a mental block about justifying spending money on clothes outside of work wear. Now that I don’t go into the office I’ve spent a ton of money on these types of items, and I suspect there are a lot more like me.	episode_done:True
text:Is 2020 the year of the 'house dress?' On comfort as a 'trend'.	labels:These kinds of dresses are really popular in Japan as casual wear. Many women will wear them around the house or just to run Errands. Often they are worn with leggings for a comfortable look with the fit often being slightly oversize. This is possibly as close as we will get to comfort fashion/athleisure in Japan. The style borders with the Mori girl (forest girl) look which favors loose dresses in natural fabrics.   &#x200B;  Look at shops like Uniqlo or Muji - the womenswear section always has a few in stock all year round. I myself own quite a few of these type dresses to wear at home, on weekends and to work.  &#x200B;  In my office today, all the women are wearing some sort of loose fit dress because it is hot as balls outside.	episode_done:True
text:Is 2020 the year of the 'house dress?' On comfort as a 'trend'.	labels:I’m a fan of the muumuu and wear baggy dresses regularly.   For me, “house dress” is something that either isn’t good enough to wear out (too ratty/thin) or something loose enough to not constrict and not so fragile that I worry about ruining it doing light chores. The latter gets worn outside the house regularly.    Sadly, many of my frocks don’t get worn nowadays because I need to dress for my 80F home office as opposed to a 68F office building.	episode_done:True

text:Is 2020 the year of the 'house dress?' On comfort as a 'trend'.	labels:I think the “oversized comfort dress” trend and the “no bra/bralette/soft bra only” trend intersect nicely.	episode_done:True
text:Is 2020 the year of the 'house dress?' On comfort as a 'trend'.	labels:It goes back a lot further than Victorian times, there was a garment similar to this under women’s structured clothing at least in Europe for several centuries. For upper classes it served as a nightgown, and for lower classes it was something they could do house work in. It has nothing to do with nursery rhymes or even women’s appearances, its construction was simple because it wasn’t meant to be seen.	episode_done:True
text:Is 2020 the year of the 'house dress?' On comfort as a 'trend'.	labels:i love an all cotton baggy T-shirt dress, and have them in multiple colours. They are my go-to for slacking round the house when it's warm enough. Sometimes i sleep in them as well, not gonna lie. As far as kaftan type garments go, i am planning on sewing up a couple, they will be in linen.	episode_done:True
text:Is 2020 the year of the 'house dress?' On comfort as a 'trend'.	labels:I have a few what I would consider to be housedresses in this definition. They are simple in shape - two pieces of fabric, sleeveless, usually no dart, no waist, hemmed - lengths ranging from above the knee to down to the ankle. I've certainly worn them to work and otherwise in public, so they're not just "house" dresses. They're comfortable in the summer in non-A/C environments, like my home office, or the previous place I worked (also no A/C). You can throw on a little sweater for A/C environments, or where sleeveless is not 100% appropriate.  I'm wearing one right now.   I have never bought one new - they're always purchased at thrift stores. Since the sizing is pretty free with these, I may not even bother to try them on. Used, I'd say that they range in price from ten dollars on down.	episode_done:True
